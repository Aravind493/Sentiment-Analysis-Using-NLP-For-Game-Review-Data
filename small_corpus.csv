Here is my assessment of the game so far:
GRAPHICS: The graphics are very lackluster. I understand this is a DS game, but I am using it on the new 3DS XL with the biggest screen and the game still looks fuzzy.
GAMEPLAY: The flow of the games is limited to going to different points on a map and not being able to move to another location until you solve the given puzzle(s). Sometimes you will be tasked with having to find an object in one of the rooms, but the cruddy graphics make it hard to be certain of what or where to click on the screen. However, you can just click all over the screen until the item reveals itself.

Red Dead Redemption has incredible graphics and fantastic audio, which adds up to create an unparalleled atmosphere that makes you feel like you're really in the wild west.  But the missions and story are mostly boring and forgettable, with pointless side quests, and glitches horrible enough to essentially ruin the game.

Long Review:

Note:  This review is spoiler free with regards to the game's story.

Having all but conquered city based free roaming games, it's no surprise that Rockstar would eventually brand out to try and allow players to conquer other areas, this time taking us back to the turn of the century Wild West, essentially creating Grand Theft Horse.  Instead of fast motorcycles and flashy cars, you have horses and stagecoaches.  And while it sounds like an awesome and unique idea, we get an end product that's very pretty and incredibly atmospheric, but is packed with boring missions and glitches so severe, it at times ruins the game completely.

Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston as he heads across the lands of New Austin, the last holdout of the wild west on the Mexican border.  His mission is simple:  His lovely wife and young son have been kidnapped and held hostage by the government, and if he wants to get them back and get a clean break from his former life, he has to hunt down and take out the members of his old gang.

Taking on the role of John, you run around in a massive open ended world where you can go virtually anywhere you want to.  Every western cliche is here, including ramshackle old frontier towns, cactus, giant stone monoliths, forests filled with bears, adobe houses, and even tumbleweeds.  Like every other free roam game, you run around this world to find missions to complete, and thus advance the story.  It's an incredibly beautiful world, as unlike Liberty/Vice/Stilwater city, there are no skyscrapers, no malls, or giant buildings.  Everything here is turn of the century technology, with the biggest building being only two stories tall.  As a result, the world feels massive and virtually endless.  You feel like a tiny ant in the middle of a very large and untamed world, and gives the game an epic feel that very few games can match.

However, Red Dead Redemption has the huge problem of feeling mostly pointless.  Almost all the missions follow this pattern:

1.  Get on a horse and ride halfway across the map with a partner.
2.  Listen to said partner deliver expositional dialogue to advance the plot.
3.  Reach destination.
4.  Kill everyone.
5.  Watch as partner rides off, abandoning you.
6.  Spend several minutes riding to the other side of the map to get your next mission, grumbling at how slow you're going.

As a result, most of the missions are very forgettable.  There are a few exceptions, such as fort assaults, boat rides, etc. but for the most part, the missions do very little to distinguish themselves.  As a result, it feels like you're just slogging through mission after mission, wondering when things are going to get interesting.  Thankfully, the third act of the game does reverse this trend, as there are a few creative and clever missions that are interesting to play through, but it's essentially too little, too late.

Outside of the story, there are a good amount of side missions, where you can become a bounty hunter and track down criminals, help random strangers out, go hunting for treasure, collect flowers, hunt animals, etc. but after a while, I realized that these quests are, in effect, pointless.  You mainly get money and fame/honor for doing them, but you get plenty of money from the story missions, and the fame/honor has barely any effect on the gameplay in general.  You can unlock rewards (such as riding stagecoaches for free), but it takes a long time to do so, and is not worth the effort.  I personally stopped doing all the diversions and side missions halfway through the game, because it felt like a waste of time.

Red Dead's story, like the missions, moves at a near glacial pace.  While the core story will make you want to keep going to find out if John rescues his family or not, it takes forever to get there.  The story contains a ton of fat that could be cut out, from characters who add nothing to the main plot, to virtually everything in Mexico, which has little to no impact on the main story.  It isn't until the third act that there's a sense of real danger and threat, and the drama picks up.  However, it's made worse by the fact that Red Dead makes one of THE worst mistakes a story can make...after the climax, it just doesn't end.  You feel like you've reached the end of the game, only to find that it keeps going and going and going and going.  After an hour of playing pointless, tutorial like missions, I lost my patience and wondered when the hell the game was going to end.  As a result, when the ending FINALLY came, I didn't care at all about what happened.

Then there's the game's many bugs and glitches:  If you hunt around on the internet, you'll come across humorous videos of people flying like birds, midgets acting like cougars, talking coyotes, etc.  However, those videos don't tell you about some of the other, more infuriating bugs.  Among the ones I experienced:

*In one mission, I assisted a group of people in taking over a fortress.  Afterwards, I went exploring and opened a standard chest to get some money.  Then an informant was running away from me, and seconds later, I was wanted for...something, and EVERYONE I had just helped to infiltrate the fortress was trying to kill me.
*Half my inventory would randomly vanish, ruining hours of hunting and searching for goods.
*I save a woman from being raped, and kill her captor.  A guy starts shooting at me, so I kill him in self defense.  For some reason, my honor goes down.
*I rent a room (AKA save/respawn point) in a new town, get involved in a duel and get killed, and get respawned several miles away in some OTHER town.
*John is being attacked by wolves.  I aim and pull the trigger, but John refuses to shoot his fully loaded gun and is torn to shreds.
*I run through a town, when the sheriff, for no reason whatsoever, shoots and kills me.
*The game crashes, making me loose most of my progress.

It's sad really...my first impressions of Red Dead Redemption were fantastic, but the more and more I played, I realized I just wasn't having any fun, and was starting to despise the game for how slow it was going, and how so many things felt pointless and annoying.  Add in how short and badly done the tutorials are (they appear on screen for about fifteen seconds, then vanish, often taking place in real time), John's annoying personality (he acts like Forrest Gump in a cowboy outfit, and I got the impression he was mildly retarded), and with the glitches, my annoyance turned to disgust.

In the end, while Red Dead Redemption is incredibly beautiful and very atmospheric, the story needs much editing and trimming, the missions are forgettable, the annoying characters will get on your nerves, the ending goes on longer then ""The Return of the King"" and the glitches will annoy you to no end.  I personally think Red Dead Redemption is yet another over-hyped game that turns out to be, at best, mediocre, and at worst, infuriating.","Very pretty, but as empty and hollow as a wasteland",1282867200,61,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

OK, the game's graphics are really nice. Not on the scale of Ghost Recon, but still nice. Maybe if the soldiers weren't so dumb and you at least had a little control over them it would be slightly better, but you don't.

The graphics where that of a xbox original, i am not joking they are some of the WORST graphics i have seen in a long time. NOT only are the graphics bad but the game play is not much better. Besides the fact that when you walk you look like you have something rather large in your butt making your player look VERY stiff, and has for the story, WAIT there was a story here??? well if there was anything to do with a story then i must have missed it, the so called story here is not at ALL good in fact it was just pain boring and luckily for me was VERY short beating it in under 2 hours. Ok now on to the level design, well lets just say that it was some of the worst i have seen. It goes like this, run into to dark boring room shoot a few bad guys or zombies then move to the next room that looks almost the same then repeat and do again for the next few hours. Ok so now i will move to the sound of the game, so the zombies when you kill them it sounds OK at best, but as for the sound of the guns WOW OMFG the worst EVER sounds weaker then a nerf guns!!!! the voice overs are very bad as well. Ok now onto the only kind of fun in this game, the only time i had ANY fun on this game was when i played with friends, but even still it was very boring. There is a ranking system that is mediocre at best, the more enemy's you kill the more XP you will get, and when you earn XP you can buy guns that won't really care to use because they all for the most part suck, or you can buy powers for the different players you can choose from. I would also like to add in the fact that when i you enemy it is almost completely random as to when they die, sometimes it will only take a few shoots to kill a simple solder and other time the same kind of enemy will take a clip and a half to kill, as well as that but the hit indication is very OFF. So i will wrap this up by saying this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, rent it first to see for yourself. i hope someone can find fun in this game, but for me i could not find much fun here.

I forgot to add in here that the AI IS THE WORST IN ANY GAME EVER. your team mates make no attempt whatsoever to avoid danger or even bother to shoot at the enemy, your friendly AI will spend the bulk of their time wasting ammo on a wall or ceiling if they are even shooting at ALL, the rest of the time they are just in your way block you in doorways or blocking your shots, never before have i ever seen AI worse than this. As for the enemy AI they are just as bad, half the time the enemy is just standing there as i am shooting them.

""This is a review of the Product. Not the game only, but the product itself listed above.

The product installs a great game. That being said, it also installs spyware/malware onto my computer. This is the same type of software that I have paid programs to remove for years. Why would a user want to install it deliberately onto their machine?

If you buy this product, know that one day it will cease to work. I don't care if it is 6 months from now, or 10 years from now. You are not buying an actual product, you are renting it until you change your computer a total of 3 times. Considering I have 6 computers on my network alone, and I use at least 3 of those as gaming rigs, I know this would be relatively quick for me. Either way, you will most likely not be able to dig this out of the closet in 10 years and nostalgically play. You are buying a self destructing product.

The DRM on this game does not do anything to limit piracy as the company says. Spore itself was already downloaded DRM free 100k some-odd times before the game was even released. SecuROM is not a DRM scheme, as it does nothing to prevent piracy. It does everything to limit the value of the product to the legit customer and prevent them from selling it to a second party. This has been proven an illegal practice in multiple lawsuits throughout the years, however they continue to install the software on end users computers without their consent.

I am not a pirate. If I was a pirate, I would probably already be happily playing this game instead of being here writing this. Again, no pirates need to complain about DRM. They are usually busy playing the game free. ""","Well, another DRM failure from them",1224720000,5,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

But, I have always wanted something to charge that controller without having to have my PS3 powered up. Most were more expensive than I was willing to pay, so when I saw this item, I thought I would give it a shot. The first thing I noticed, when plugging the device into the wall, was that there was nothing to indicate that it was recieving power. Just to make sure that it wasn't a problem with the outlet, I changed the device to another outlet that had been used with other electronics. I plugged in the device, but still received no indication that the controller was getting powered. I left the item overnight, and returned in the morning; when I powered up the PS3, it still told me my controller needed a charge.

So, there are two definite negatives with this device:

It doesn't have any way of letting you know your controllers are getting charged.
It feels pretty flimsy, so it could have easily have been damanged in shippment.

(---) It's absolutely bug infested, riddled with quest and progress breaking bugs. I have had to re-log in order to force portions of quests to function approximately 20% of the time. Game breaking bugs made the first dungeon incapable of being finished. I have fallen through the world and been unable to play again until after the servers were taken down for maintenance. Several other times I fell through the world, was forced to re-log, then had to wait 10-15 minutes before I could control my character again. I've lost levels to random ""rollbacks"" - in which the client experiences an error and crashes, and when you log back on you've lost your past hour of progress. I've been killed instantly by terrain, become trapped in rocks or walls or grass, been shot into the sky by passing NPCs......this is disgraceful. I have beta tested many games, played many MMOs at launch, and never, ever, have I seen a game so incredibly unfinished. I am not being hyperbolic at all when I state that this game is still in alpha, and it is a shame that Bethesda is charging money for it

(-) Controller support is absent, and the general keyboard & mouse controls are awkward. It plays very similar to Skyrim but with subtle differences to accommodate for the fact that it's a MMO. Sadly these subtle differences don't translate well.

(+/-) Presentation is generally strong, but suffers from some incredibly low res textures throughout, alongside some awful voice acting and animation. Most of it is good, but the poor parts are truly terrible and jarring

(+) A huge world full of memorable content, on and off the beaten path. It makes Skyrim seem downright tiny in comparison

(+/-) Deep and layered character customization (regarding skills, not aesthetics) that translates pretty well to combat and general gameplay, offset by the awkward controls and some pre-beta level tuning

(-) User interface, crafting, inventory, it's all a mixed bag of poor, dated design elements and mechanisms. It is so awful it deserves its own bullet point. The basic bag and banking systems, common to MMOs and refined over the years, is like something out of a nightmare in 2003

(-) Stability is abysmal. Lag is common. Interactions not working. Group members appearing offline when they're in front of you. Guild functions not working for days. Dropped packets. Etc, etc, etc. It's like some tiny fly-by-night company is running this thing. It's sad

(-) Aggressively drab and uninspired character and gear design. This applies to not just gear, like armor and weapons, but also spells and abilities and class distinctions. I don't expect the players in an Elder Scroll game to resemble blinking neon signs like they do in other games (WoW), but man, even the best gear one could acquire in this game is just plain and boring.

Because this thing won't let you go on without beating the level and to do that you have to pass the reading and writing sections for it.

This game has a horrible teaching style. What it does is show you a character. Now you have to press the correct English world for it.

What the game should do is, put up a Picture of the item you're looking at and you now think of what that word is in Chinese.

I have had several wireless Logitech mice and never had a mouse run out this quickly. Another note is you NEED to turn it off when not in use! The mouse will continue to drain the battery. This has been my experience when I leave it and come back it is usually on 10%. Note - Received a replacement mouse and it was the same. You could use a chargeable battery to put in if you were gaming on the fly but eventually you will break the battery access door in doing so.

I compare every Gaming mouse to the Logitech G7 Gaming Mouse; my all time favorite 5 star mouse.

http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G7-Laser-Cordless-Mouse/dp/B000AOIP9O/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1395576367&sr=8-5&keywords=logitech+g7

Logitech stopped supporting this mouse in their software making a great mouse obsolete! The G7 had a quick swap battery with a second battery which was placed in the charger USB station. Great idea and it worked. Even in a quick action game I could swap a battery quick enough to continue without missing a beat. Changing the battery on G700s is slow and you have to be careful not to break the release tab on the battery access door. The G7 mouse was a 600mAh Li-ion and continually beats out 1900 mAh for life. I have tried 2200mAh batteries but have not seen an longer battery life. What I do is connect the mouse to a cell phone charger if I need it to charge and still need to use it. Cell phone charger cables are usually thin and you can still use the mouse. The supplied USB charging cable is stiff and not a good solution when using this mouse connected to it. Also you will need to ensure you are connected to a always on / charging USB port on your computer when using the USB charging cable. Not all USB ports do this.

The button lay out is good but will need some getting used to. This will be the case on any gaming mouse and will be greatly affect but each individuals hand size. I do not care for the rough exterior finish on the mouse and feel it hinders reaching for the buttons. It is more a feeling thing. The Logitech Gaming Software has been improved and seems to work well. It allows you to customize the buttons or use an existing game profile. The mouse wheel is a nice size and easily scrolls.

This mouse is heavy and doesn't glide over my desk like the G7. The G7 glides like it is on ice the G700s takes much more effort to move and is rough. I do not care for the rough coating on the skin of the mouse. This is more of a feeling thing. I am sure it is meant to help in holding the mouse. Due to the weight and rough glides this mouse may not be comfortable to use for extended lengths of time. Time will tell but I will admit I would have returned this mouse and have gone back to using my G7 even with some features not being supported with the Logitech SetPoint software.

I did get what I felt was a good deal on this mouse and will try to use it when gaming and I need those extra buttons but will reluctantly do so.

My X41's have one serious flaw - they pop every time a wireless device accesses WiFi and can interfere with access speed.  This new set fixes that one problem but fails to deliver the same quality sound and construction.

NOT PAIRED - INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRONG
Out of the box the headset was NOT PAIRED with the transmitter.  The instructions to do this procedure ARE WRONG.  I  thought my set was broken!  Follow the first part of the pairing steps but on the transmitter, only hold the pair button until it starts flashing, then release and wait.  It is horrible that the instructions provided are wrong.  I found the solution in a review on another site.

BUZZ - ANNOYING
There is no more pop or hiss like in the older models.  This headset has clean, pure sound - except for the buzz.  The buzz was predominately in the right side and was unaffected by cable or input combinations.  Like the other reviewer on Amazon noted - the frequency and volume varies which makes it hard to ignore.

SOUND QUALITY - POOR
If you have X41's you will be disappointed in the sound quality of Turtle Beach's newer headsets (see my other reviews).  I'm not sure if they are using lower quality components but the new models sound like you have your finger in your ears!  Even with the bass boost on, the bass doesn't come close to the X41's.
This headset also has a harsh compressor or limiter that keeps the volume at a constant level.  It might seem like a good thing but it starts to get weird when your gun is quieter than the sound of boots on the pavement around you.  Unlike the higher models, there is no way to defeat this.  This is not an issue with the X41's

BUILD QUALITY - CHEAP
You paid how much for these?  They feel like a product that costs $20.  There is a noticeable difference in build quality and feel versus the older X41's.

All the connections seem to fit just fine in all the places they should, none of the wires are bent or bulging or clipped, but they still intermittently drop the signal sometimes giving you just sound and no video, or just nothing at all.

I have other component cables for other devices that work flawlessly, so I would doubt its my TV, and the standard composite Wii cables don't ever cut out so I would doubt its the Wii.

First time I started the Wii up the signal died before I could even launch a game, took all the wires out, checked everything over for kinks or breaks, plugged everything back in and it worked for 5 minutes before going to a black screen again. Fidgeting with the wires without unplugging I was able to regain sound, but no picture.

This area of the game seems to be a constant work in progress for the UFC franchise and I had hoped we'd see major improvements for UFC 2.  Judging from the videos I'd seen online, I expected a pretty clear, straightforward system that would be more simplistic and user friendly than previous titles.  Not hardly.  If you can't stuff a takedown and you're playing on any level above Easy, good luck.  You might as well hit Pause and quit, especially against strong grapplers.  Trying to prevent a transition is virtually impossible.  The CPU player will quickly and easily gain a dominant position, drain your stamina, and either submit you or knock you out.  I've lost track of the amount of times I've found myself yelling at the TV screen in frustration as I dominant someone in the standup most of the fight only to be dragged down and finished.  There's been some bad grappling designs in this franchise over the years but this ranks right up there as one of the worst.

The other thing worth mentioning is Knockout Mode.  I was under the impression that this was identical to a regular fight only the grappling was disabled.  I was looking forward to going three or five rounds in what would essentially be a kickboxing match.  That's not the case.  Knockout Mode unnecessarily places a health meter above both guys which shows the amount of blows you can absorb (adjustable up to ten) before being knocked out.  This results in a watered down, anticlimactic version of what I was hoping for.  Instead of having to watch your stamina and fight smart, you just slug it out for thirty seconds like a game of Rock'em Sock'em Robots.

The graphics look great and the striking system is decent but the grappling design makes this game virtually unplayable on any level other than Easy.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  I'd like to think UFC 3 will be an improvement over this version but EA doesn't seem to care about much these days other than monetizing their games.","Great Graphics, Decent Striking, Impossible Grappling System",1496448000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

So why did I only give it 2 stars if it works perfectly with my mat and wireless controller?
Well it doesn't work with my sony PS2 controllers. I have four sony PS2 controllers and none work fully with this device. I have one controller that came with my slim PS2, two controllers that came with my fat ps2, and one controller that I bought and none of them work fully. The R1 and R2 are not recognized at all and the up directional pad doesn't work on two of the controllers.

Also there is major problem with the drivers. The company that made this doesn't exist anymore. So there really aren't any drivers specifically made for anything beyond windows XP. If you want to find the latest drivers do a google search for dilong 203 drivers but don't use them. Basically I found a guy on stepmania web site that had the drivers up on file hosting site. What happen after installing these drivers was all my fonts got messed up. I'm guessing the drivers were for a Chinese OS. Basically I couldn't read anything on my PC. All texts under my incons were foreign symbols. All text in all texts were foreign symbols. I had to pull out my nexus 7 to search the web for a fix. Basically I ended up using my windows 7 install disc to repair my pc. If you have a system that had windows pre installed and don't have win7 disc you would be in horrible trouble if you didn't make a backup or rescue disc. Before I found a fix I was getting ready to reinstall windows 7.

Now there may be english drivers that won't mess up your pc but it isn't worth the risk looking for them if you ask me. Anyway the basic drivers that come on the disc will let you use a wireless logitech PS2 controller and a redoctane dance mat.  I also tried a guitar that almost worked fully. The only thing that didn't work was the whammy bar.

So if you buy this for mat or wireless ps2 controller make sure to backup the drivers on the disc.  Personally I think you might be better off getting one that is known to work with windows 7 and one that is made by a company that is still in business.

Also note i did try restarting my computer and installing the drivers in windows xp compatibility mode to get the ps2 controllers to work. No dice.

Baroque takes place in a post-apocalyptical world where the few remaining survivors have been twisted into strange forms, are haunted by guilt and madness, and remember only confusing fragments of what happened to them. It is this world that your silent avatar is plopped down into and told by the leader of the survivors, the Archangel, to lug a bulky rifle down to the bottom of Neuro Tower, a gargantuan structure that towers over the ruined landscape, and use it to purify the creature held captive down there.

That is pretty much all the direction you are going to get. Baroque is all about letting the player discover things for themselves. Normally, this would be a good thing. However, progression is made as unintuitive as possible. For example, triggering certain events causes Neuro Tower to expand and contract. In RPG's, the traditional way to do this is to hide clues in the things NPC's say. Now imagine a game where say very bizarre things and its only after you talk to them about fifty-odd times that a method to their madness becomes clear. Also imagine the one key clue only has random chance of being revealed after you've gone on the same fool's errand about ten times.

This is really what makes Baroque so frustrating. In most games, the point is to complete a task without dying. In Baroque, dying is a key component of game play. You have to walk into Nuero Tower multiple times and either clear the dungeon or die trying just to get the story to move along ever so slightly so you can figure it out without a walkthrough guide.

Every time I managed to piece together a puzzle, the payoff was meager. I was just handed a new puzzle (or at least I think I was. The game is mean enough to throw something completely pointless at you.) and no or limited new information. In a way, Baroque is lot like assembling a jigsaw puzzle without any reference to what its supposed to look like when complete and all the pieces are buried in an Olympic pool-sized sandbox.

Baroque is game played trapped in a time warp. Each time you clear the tower or die, you are transported right back outside into the town at level one with your inventory stripped from you. You have to go right back into the tower and start everything all over again. As I said before, dying has no real penalty. In fact, it is a necessity for making progress. You could say that players don't lose at Baroque, they only stall. Or you could also say that players don't win at Baroque either, since, win or die, the outcome is the same.

But still, as frustratingly random as I found the game, I did make it to the end. The story starts as confusing clap-trap, but it does clear some of itself up by the end. However, if you have ever played Digital Devil Saga, you have already heard this plot and heard it better with superior characterization, presentation, and cohension.

Baroque is an action RPG. The mute protagonist must enter the tower bare handed and search for weapons, tools, and the NPC's that dwell there while fighting swarms of monsters. In Baroque's favor, combat is not terrible just simplistic. Customization is the key to victory as there are all sorts of accessories and items to collect to boost strength. Essentially there are two health meters, the HP gauge, that decreases as monster injury you, and the vitality gauge which steadily decreases over time and must be refilled with the crystals dropped by slain monsters. The addition of the vitality gauge makes it necessary to search the levels quickly yet thoroughly.

Baroque also boasts lots of tools but most of the thing you come across of marked as 'unidentified' meaning you either have to use them on faith and hope you didn't just inject yourself with a lose a level potion or throw an invincibility item at an enemy or find an appraisal parasite to reveal what the item is. However, the appraisal parasites are few and far between and one use only, so you will be lugging around a bunch of unidentified items in your limited inventory. Items also have lots of other nasty tricks such as armor that doesn't come off or armor that unequips itself every time an enemy comes near.

If I had to pick one really good thing about Baroque is that it has an excellent atmosphere and it really gets you to identify with the characters as they live through their repetitious Purgatory-like world. After traversing the tower for the tenth time, I felt like the poor tormented creature trapped in the basement of the dungeon, repeating ""Don't go crazy"" over and over again.

Baroque is ATLUS's yearly turkey, that one title they seem to put every year that tries to be innovative and off-the-cuff without considering if the end result is a fun game. This is not a hardcore RPG in the sense that the term usually means, which is to say difficult (It's really easy) and one that you must put some real effort into. This is a game that will only appeal to people who can love repetition like the most obsessive compulsive personality. Not recommended.","Baroque Sounds An Awful Lot Like ""Broke"" Doesn't It?",1208390400,14,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Unless, of course, I am playing the newest version.  OK, so I'm a few hours in, got a good city (or two) going...switching back and forth, sending money or other necessities to whichever city needs it...sweet!  But all of the sudden I try to switch cities and can't.  Server is down or bad connection or whatever...nothing for however long it was down is saved.  There is no warning as you're playing (come on!...server down, connection lost, anything?).  It's just gone.  If you have to be online all the time to play, so be it, I can live with that.  But if I'm online all the time, how come when I quit I have to wait a good long time for my city to ""sync"" with the server?  Shouldn't it be synced at all times, since I'm online?  Also, it's the little things that bug you...why do fire, ambulance, police get stuck in traffic when there is a clear route around?  And they sit at stoplights...really?

What really gets my goat is that EA knew this was a borked game when they put it on the market.  They said ""whoops, sorry, here's a different free game to download"".  Then there was a bunch of double talk about not having enough servers and the game can't be made to work offline etc.  Right.  Hey EA, if you want to sell me add-ons and upgrades, great!  Done it before, happy to pay for the good stuff but don't force it down my throat!

Now I have to say, as a caveat, if you look at my stats I've played this game a lot.  Hours and hours.  But you'll also see where I've started city after city and quit and reloaded and restarted.  Mostly because after a bit of playing, the sound has quit, or clicking the menu bar brings up nothing or challenges state ""You need ?? and ?? to get 'whatever' (?? being blank spaces or filled with gobbledygook)"" or things simply get out of whack and I quit, only to find there is no contact with the server.

The game is very fun, while it's working.  Unfortunately, for a hardcore gamer like myself, it doesn't seem to ""keep"" working.  Unfortunately for me, I'll keep trying, keep reloading and restarting and hoping things get fixed.  As for the free game download, Thanks EA!  But fix the dang game I purchased!

Edited:  Another game.  Tried to switch cities, got the ""Please try again"" message. Tried to quit and save, ""Please try again"".

The shots do not come off right, the shooting animation is so slow that you can have a wide open guy on the wing and by the time he gets up and into the air and release the shot, a defender can make up serious ground and block it.  Against the computer, I had JJ Reddick and Turkoglu blocked 5 times apiece by Mourning and Shaq coming from the basket on what were wide open shots. There are also a ton of missed dunks, even Howard missed several. It is hard to pull of three's as well, since their guaranteed bricks.

The point guard and fatigue issue also sucks. The comp team never subs regardless of sliders. And their point guard scores 90% of the points. I played vs. Milwaukee and Maurice Williams scored practically every basket. This occured regardless of what level. Edit player is also a joke; I cannot edit the height, but at least I can edit the number and position. The rosters were supposed to be as of Aug. 24th, but where is Turiaf? And why is Battie a FA, he was never renounced or waived!

The press box angle is actually not bad. I dunno why Live insists on having their players pass in uncoventional ways, things like hook-shot style passes, behind the backs, even though the situation does not need those. The subsitution is also clunky; you can do the sub using the D-pad during a break in the action, but by the time you select the player you are bringing in, the game resumes leaving you with the same people on the court.

The timeouts are also timed, as in if you call a 20, there is a 20 second clock and so on. But you can always press a button to continue. The archs on the shots are off as well. Who shoots a high-archer in the paint? There are no retroes unless their unlockable. The courts look good but they don't have mascots, so it seems kinda dead.

* No pools. No toddlers. No dishwashers or trash compactors. Seriously?
* The teeniest, tiniest ""neighborhood"" you can imagine.
* You don't get to pick your own wishes for your sims anymore, removing that aspect of developing your character through those wishes. Now your sim will decide what he or she wants. You're really not necessary to the process. How is this a game again?

Things I do like:

I have played all the Lego video games (except Harry Potter 2) and this is by far the least fun. I give it points for the amusing love triangle between Batman, Robin and Superman and that's about it. The gameplay is oddly glitchy and basically terrible. Driving is crappy and pointless. Fly too close to a building, and you will see nothing but the back of your character fill the screen as the camera squeezes itself between you and the building. In many spots you will not be able to turn, drop or fly out of this situation. I fell in little cracks in corners beside the suit-change circles in 2 different spots in the maze, and was unable to get out (restart game). I fell into a little alley high up between 2 buildings and was unable to get out (restart game). The split screen in co-op story mode moves around so radically you will lose your character during fights and pummel your partner just as much as the enemies. Trying to aim a laser or heat vision while your partner is moving at all? Good luck holding the reticle in place. Ping the map and follow to a red dot for a red brick, and the mini-game you need to complete may or may not be there (same with characters you are trying to unlock). More than once I found myself at an empty parking lot or dock or park (go about 20 yards away and hang out for a bit, then go back and they appear). You take no damage in flying or driving levels in story mode. You don't even drive or fly. You are on a rail shooting all but unmoving targets until the level ends. While free-roaming the city, you will unlock a red brick. In the 12 minutes it takes the game to autosave your progress, enemies will beat on you and kill you as you stand frozen waiting for the save to end. Finish the story and you are done with 20% of the game. The next 80% is spent finding things for which you have little or no use. You can unlock a pile of different watercraft, but there is nothing to do in the water and no place to dock (I triangled out of the boat in the middle of the river hoping to respawn on land... nope, back in the boat. so I finally ran aground and popped out).

6/26 - After enduring more of this trainwreck of a game, I have dropped the overall rating to 1 Star and a personal grade of D. Retrieving the gold bricks from the heads of the large lego statues is amazingly terrible. Fly too close and the game will whip you 180 degrees, so you get to turn yourself slowly around to try again. Hover above the head hole and try to guess when/where to drop (this goes for small roof landings too) and risk missing (for another do-over). The wait time for each brick (while it auto-saves) is approx 10 seconds (no biggie? Multiply that by 250 gold bricks and you have 42 minutes of save/wait time only in brick hunting). I rode a giraffe along a trail of studs to get a gold brick only to have the giraffe (and my character) just disappear (this happened riding the gorilla too).

With this being the case it makes sense that developers of the new comers learn from and improve based on titles that have been on the shelves. Obviously this logic doesn't follow through in the real world, enter Kingdom Under Fire.

Now although some of the sounds of battle are pretty well done, KUF leaves a generic after taste. swords clash with as much enthusiasm as a high school thespian take on Hamlet. Horses, arrows, trampling feet, all sound generic and uninspired. The final death blow to the sound quality comes from the voice acting. Dialogue feels cheap and meaningless between yawn inspiring battle charges and filler buster comments among characters.

The graphics have also suffered. Although character models look good form long range, animations and detail look childish at a closer glance. I simply can't say enough bad things about the animation. One such example is the way characters run through trees and obstacles, it looks more like they're running in place while the world moves around and shifts out of their way. Usually poor voice acting and graphics go hand in hand and KUF is no exception. Characters don't even speak their lines. Instead the programmers decided to have the characters constantly ""chew gum""  while the voice track is played. Even after they speak  the characters continue to do the chewing motion-is this level of programing really acceptable with the capabilities of the XBOX?

Gameplay quickly becomes boring no matter what the mission is. Battles mean mashing your troops into enemy troops with the ocassional support of varying soldier types. This does add a level of tactics to the game but not enough to compete-or even step in the same field as other strategy titles. The core of all battles is getting your character in the thick of the melee. The quickest and most efficient way to end these battles is by finding the commander of the enemy forces and quickly taking them out. Its a good idea but translates into a random chance on the battlefield as the commanders always look like the other enemies on the screen. You'll be lucky if you find them.

With everything said, Kingdom Under Fire is a title that adds no ambition to the RTS genre. All aspects of the game range from bland to mediocre and onward to generic. This title is obviously an attempt by programmers who love RTS' to get a foot hold on the genre; the reallity is that they should have stayed out or developed a more valiant effort.

Where can I start? Well, for starters, there are very low-resolution textures everywhere. Outside of campaign mode, there are very few decorative objects and minimal textures, and don't get me started on the lack of destructible objects. Some of the windows can't even be broken. Online multiplayer lags in the menus (although I didn't experience this during combat), and that's if you can even get into a game. There are only a few dozen players on at any given time. I imagine the PS4 and Xbone don't have this problem. Speaking of new consoles, the screenshots and videos are all from those consoles. The PS3 and 360 graphics are lower quality than the ones used in the original Black Ops, way back in 2010. Decorative corpses in Campaign mode look like they came out of a late 90's PC game. Weapon models take longer to load than the game does, so you'll spend 10-20 seconds at the start of each online game holding an invisible gun. Sounds cool, but it looks stupid.

The menus for the game lag even in offline multiplayer. You can barely manage to set up one load-out without chucking the controller in frustration at the amount of lag in THE MENU. I honestly believe they designed this game for PS4 and Xbone, and then stripped out the models and textures for the older systems, without actually changing the menus or anything else, resulting in lag from the systems trying to process more than they can handle. Even the Wii U Call of Duty games still have a more active player base than the PS3 version of this game, and they haven't gotten a new one since Ghosts.

Don't buy this game for PS3 or 360. Especially not this expensive edition. Save the money and put it towards a PS4 or Xbone, and then buy Black Ops III later this year. Sledgehammer (the company that made this CoD game) is an awful, incompetent company. Thankfully Treyarch is making the next game, and they have a reputation for consistently good games.

**Edit**

I'll be clear: it's not the worse game ever, but it's the same game MMO players have been playing for years. Many professional critics and reviewers agree. My main problem is that Bioware harped on innovation and there isn't any. They spent all their money on voices and none on gameplay. I left WoW to play this, and all I got was another WoW. I really wanted to like this game and I hoped that it would be able to stand on its own merit but it didn't. After writing the review, I tried to play again and this time with a different class, but it's really just more of the same. If you have never played an MMO, then this one might be for you, but for MMO vets like me, we've seen it all before. Games like Rift, though unpolished, at least tried something different.

I DO own a Nintendo DS, and I could not be happier with it.  Because I do not own a PSP, let me just compare the specifications, products available, etc.

  1.  Screens.  The DS has two.  The DS has a touch screen.  So what if the PSP's screen is bigger than either one of the DS's?  No matter how hard you push on that great big screen, it just isn't going to do anything.  Except break.

  2.  Products.  Let me divide this into three categories.

  A. Games.  While I admit the DS does not have the greatest selection of games (yet) it still has a better selection than the PSP.  I do happen to be a sports-game person, but if I wasn't, I would probably be bored to tears by 90% of the PSP games.  And besides, what good is a handheld game system without that beloved, little red plumber?
  B. Movies.  If you don't like Spider Man, you probably won't find any good movies for the PSP.  If you DO like Spider Man, you'll find exactly one.  Wow.  Go buy yourself a GBA SP and a nice portable DVD player for about the same price ($250), and you can watch all the movies you want (and play a better selection of games to boot).
  C.  With your PSP, you can hold about six songs.  Whoopie.  One for each day of the...I mean...well, maybe you can fit seven really short songs.  Buy yourself a DS and an iPod ($250) and carry 10,000 songs and a great gaming system with you wherever you go.
  3.  Price.  Which is less, $250 or $150?  This isn't rocket science, people!
  4.  Durability.  OK, I know I said I was only going to talk about specs and products, but an issue this major deserves at least a little discussion.  An incredible number of the PSP owners I have talked to, read their reviews, etc. have had problems with breakage or dead pixels.  I don't know about you, but if I am going to shell out $250+ for ANYTHING, I expect it to last for at least a week.  This goes double for those with young children in their household; if you expect your PSP to not get broken, you better chain it to your bed.

However, then it came time to play... To be honest, I haven't managed to play a single complete multiplayer match. The reason? The game has a system called ""TrueSkill"" which matches players together. At first, it didn't seem so bad. In principle, it was a great idea. However, I soon realized that it doesn't simply match you up based on your skill. It actually interferes with the match. Players who do too well often find themselves switched to the loosing team in the middle of a game. Or if an entire team is doing too good, the game will split the players up and create an entirely new game.

If this game wouldn't stop matches mid way through and simply matched players up at the beginning, I would have loved this game. However, if I can't even finish a single match without someone being tossed around... well... that means winning is essentially impossible. Oh, sure, you can win a single round within a match, but the game has a system where - based on your performance in a round - you earn money to buy upgrades for future rounds. So really, this interference messes up allot more.

In the few games where I had really good team coordination going, I had allot of fun. But it was usually in those games that being tossed around was the most annoying. It's like the game just says, ""nope. We can't let you have too much fun!""

Adding to the annoyance, the preferences page is very limited. I would have liked to be able to say, ""I prefer playing this map over this map"" and I would have liked to say, ""I don't like being on the defensive, so never place me with RNA"" - but not. The game does not give the player any say at all as to which game, what kind of game, and what objectives are played. It is entirely random.

There was, however, one plus with the multiplayer: If a team mate is a burden to the team players can call a vote to kick that player. So at least you have some say over who you are playing with. But still, I would have liked something more of a favorite player list to form teams that work well for you, and fight with those teams.

It was also a plus that I could mute individual players who use the mic waaaay too much, but sometimes I don't want to hear any mic at all. It is a bother that I have to go in and mute every single player if I am every in the mood to just not hear it.

It's just so frustrating... that after 2 days of this... I shelved it.

So I give this game 5 stars for fun (because game play is, simply put, extremely enjoyable) but give the game overall 1 star because the match system makes it almost impossible to get and more than 1 star of enjoyment out of it.",Amazing Gameplay... impossible multiplayer,1275436800,5,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Pok&eacute;mon Stadium and Mario Gold (see reviews) were the first ones, and Mario Tennis was coming. At the time, I had recently bought Perfect Dark for the N64, and I'd heard that the GBC version would use the Transfer Pak. Based on that, I bought the GBC game. Oops.
My first mistake was expecting an N64-type experience from this game, and that's simply not possible. Perfect Dark was so good for the N64 that it couldn't be translated well for the Game Boy. However, it could still be a good game in its own right. Well, it's not.
The controls, to say the least, are poor. It's difficult to aim, difficult to tell where you're aiming, hard to tell what's happening, hard to see where items are to pick up. It's just difficult to play. I couldn't even force myself to go through the first level.
The sound is nothing spectacular, and while the cut scenes are interesting, the graphics themselves are poor. The cartridge also comes with a built-in Rumble feature, but that really doesn't add anything to the game other than weight.

1.0,False,"12 27, 2007",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000QSE7FK,Tsanche,"A spin-off to a successful franchise is almost never a good thing.  The games are usually weaker than the main series and there's usually not as much effort put into them.  There are a few exceptions but not many.  Soul Calibur Legends is not an exception.  In fact it may very well be one of the worst video game spin-offs to hit the scene in recent memory.

There's not much of a story here.  You get to watch a cutscene take place and get an introduction as to what's going on, but from there the story becomes a confusing mess.  It almost makes no sense.  That aside, you'd think the gameplay would be something to admire but that may very well be the worst part about this game.  There's really not much to it and sometimes it's just downright unfair.

You'll go into a level by selecting a character a two companions.  You see some of your favorite Soul Calibur characters like Astorath, Sophitia and Taki.  You'll even be able to play as Lloyd Irving of Tales of Symphonia fame.  The controls aren't bad here.  By swinging the Wii Remote you'll be able to do horizontal and vertical slashes.  You'll use the Nunchuck to move your character around.  You can also block attacks, perform charged attacks and strife around.  The motion sensor controls of swinging the remote for sword swipes feels a little tacked on at times, though.  It isn't that, which is annoying about the controls.  What's annoying is that there is no challenge to the game whatsoever.  If you simply swing the wii remote horizontally or vertically like a madman you'll have no problem fairing in combat.

You're also approached by the same enemies over and over again.  This wouldn't really be a problem if there were a variety of them.  It's basically the same three things over and over again.  Worse than that, however, is the level design and camera.  The levels are horrible in their design.  There are traps that come from no where and sometimes the camera just doesn't work well enough.  You may round a corner and the camera won't work out well enough for you to be able to see yourself before you take damage.  Level designs are also boring and uninspired.

The game is reduced to being nothing more than a hack and slash.  And it'll mostly consist of you swinging the wii remote in a craze.  There's nothing challenging here at all.  The level designs and gameplay as a whole are repetitive.

There's also a two player co-op mode, but that can't save the gameplay at all.  There's even a versus, but you can use the same madman waving technique that you used in the actual adventure to do battle.  In short, it's boring.  If you really want to fight against a friend, it'd probably just be better to invest in one of the main series games.

Sadly, the graphics aren't stellar either.  Much of the game is pretty ugly.  Character models aren't so bad but everything is just downright ugly.  Even by the Wii's standards it could be better.  The voice acting isn't too bad, but the dialog and written script are absolutely horrible.

Even if you're a big Soul Calibur fan, Legends is not a worthwhile game at all.  If you've never played Soul Calibur before, don't let this game be your first foray into the series.

This is a warning Review. Warning of the dangers of the harbored Digital Rights Management (DRM) subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game. This type of DRM (SecuROM 7.xx with Limited Installations) is well known as it has already been used in at least two other games (BIOSHOCK & MASS EFFECT). So my review is based on first-hand experience of a core aspect of the game.

Apparently EA would rather keep its customers in the dark. That is why, in the past month, EA Forums got censored, Wikipedia entries selectively edited and Amazon reviews repeatedly deleted. What is worse, Amazon (possibly without knowing it) is breaking the law which requires the full disclosure of bundled snoop-ware.

LIMITED INSTALLS? Yes, LIMITED INSTALLS!!! We only get to ride this shiny pony for...3 laps! The official announcement mentions ""on 3 different computers"" but avoids to clarify what a ""different computer"" makes: will changing the graphics card trigger the loss of a token? what about attaching a new hard-drive (internal or external) or adding a new user account. All the above have been reported to subtract installation tokens from BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT - and EA has intentionally left this area dark gray.

Moreover, in order to enforce the limited installations, exactly like BIOSHOCK, there will be IRREMOVABLE FOLDERS placed in our systems' Root that will effectively revoke our Administrator rights to our own PCs! Short of reformatting, there is no deleting them even if logged in as Administrators.

Is EA trying to pave the way towards a nightmarish future where PC gaming will be a continuously-billed service (such as direct-Pay TV) and not a product?
Is EA trying to trigger a lemmings stampede towards the Pay-per-Play cliff, where gamers will be regarded as herded cows to be milked over months and years?
Is the Company trying to turn our PC systems (that we bought and paid for) into their proprietary consoles, hence monstrosities such as SecuROM that offer zero anti-piracy protection?
According to statements by their own spokespersons (such as John Riccitiello, CEO of EA) the answer to all of the above question is YES. However, I want to make clear that none of these statements had any impact on my rating of this game. The game has enough troubles as it is...

Is it fair to rate badly a game based on its short duration or bad graphics? How about its instability and bugs? How about harboring potentially dangerous subroutines that will render it useless within a 12-16 months? You see how this is going?

In the end, after all is said, with SPORE it boils down to this: who will actually be owning my copy? Are we to pay $50 only to...RENT this from its publisher, be potentially pestered with the insulting need to prove our purchase forever and place our hardware and data in danger?
And what makes this even harder to understand: will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy? Of course NOT! They did not work for similarly DRM-plagued BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT, why should they start working now?

So, one has to ask: what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product? Will they be required to pay again to buy another copy of the game when the first one expires?

Is THIS the solution that EA executives came up against piracy: since they cannot stop piracy, let's make all our paying customers PAY TWICE to make up for their million dollar bonuses?!

- Good graphics

- One of few games to support 1080p

- Mini Games are fun especially the shoot out

Cons

- AI is horrible.  You can have 3 defenders in the lane when a defender gets burned and they just stand there and watch as the opponent goes in for a slam

- Shot meter needs to be tweeked

- Passing needs work.  You can pull your controller up to the left and hit the pass button trying to get the ball to a wide open teammate and it will pass it to a guy behind you to the right.

- Too many slam dunks, had 12 dunks in a row in one game

- Limited number of set plays (4 on offense and 3 on defense)

- No defensive controls expect poke at the ball which 90% of the time just gets a foul called on you

- Season mode is a joke as well

This newly redesigned PSP 2000 case WILL fit your PSP game console even if you have the 2200mAh battery with extended back-plate.  There is designated cutout in the rubber that allows the PSP 2000 to rest perfectly in place with or without the extended battery cover.

Now the explanation for the one star rating:

The case itself looks a lot sleeker in the package and in pictures than envolped around the PSP system itself.  It has a cheap plasticy feel to it complete with a second rate, floating hinge that always seems as if its on the verge of breaking loose.

Also, unlike other PSP cases I've owned, the PSP logo isn't etched or inscribed onto the case lid, even though it looks that way in pictures.  The PSP trademark on top is just a thin piece of printed cardboard placed underneath the clear shell.

This case also comes complete with small rubber grips that, when opened properly, can be used to stand the case upright so you can view video files without holding the PSP in your hands.  Only problem is the rubber grips never seem to hold onto whatever surface its standing on.  It will slowly start to slide downward unitl it is laying flat on the table, the counter, the desk...etc..

This case looks, feels and performs more like a $5.00 cheapo instead of a $20.00 quality product.  For this price I would find something better (and you can...very easily) instead of settling for this lesser product.",CHEAPLY REDESIGNED FOR THE PSP 2000,1211760000,14,,

The elevator battle towards the end of the Sands of Time is the most poorly designed video game aspect in recent memory.  After more than 20 tries, I just couldn't beat it.  Whenever that happens, you know that a game is fatally flawed.

Let's break it down, shall we?  You encounter this elevator battle about 80% into the game, and you're stuck in it with Farah trying to slay hordes of monsters.  You not only have to stay alive yourself, but you also have to make sure that Farah doesn't die (an impossible feat).  If you don't die, she does; and if she doesn't die, you eventually do.  It's a lose-lose situation, especially within the confines of such small a space.

There are fountains on either side of the raised area within the elevator, but do you think you can use them to restore your life during the battle?  NO!  That's flaw number one.  Number two:  the camera angles are AWFUL.  Every single time at some point(s) in the battle, the camera would move behind a curtain, thereby obstructing your view and leaving you open to needless attack.  Three:  this game has HORRIBLE jumping mechanics.  Where you want the prince to jump, he jumps the other way.  Performing precise wall-run attacks during this battle is near impossible to execute on point each time.  Then, vaulting over enemies doesn't work all the time either.  Four:  you can't change the difficulty level in game.  I was playing on normal, and I was hoping to switch to easy to make this battle less difficult, but you can't do that unless you start a whole new game on that difficulty level.  HORRIBLE.  Because of these facts, this game is poorly designed and fatally flawed.

It's a shame how this happened in the first title I played on this trilogy because I have absolutely no interest in playing the other 2 games.  Sands of Time completely soured my opinion of the entire Prince of Persia franchise, and I am proudly going to trade this in to Amazon this week.

What's the point of making a stylus like this if it doesn't fit? I can understand making a big ""hard to loose"" stylus - but it's like they got almost everything they needed to do to make it the right size - and then just cheaped out at the end (handle). They even went so far as to make a little nub that sticks up like a regular stylus - but it's not even close to where it needs to be to fit.

Perhaps they couldn't offer the level of detail they wanted if they made it fit into the stylus slot. However, I would have been happy if the stylus fit snugly into the opening - and then had a portion sticking out - that would have been fine.

I CAN NOT BELIEVE that Warner Brothers turned the excellent story and task heavy Arkham Asylum and Arkham City games into a tedious exercise in driving with a joystick.

The Arkham Knight story starts right where Arkham City left off. Your new main adversary is Scarecrow and you're immediately thrown into a terrifying encounter at the start of the game that seems to prime you for a Batman game that lives up to its predecessors. About 15 or so minutes in your asked to Even the Odds against a few foes by calling in...you guessed it...The Batmobile. The first encounter with the Batmobile seems fun at first, but that changes rapidly when it becomes clear that said Batmobile becomes a major, if not the primary, focus of the game.

I would not have minded if the game required you to occasionally, as in once or twice, utilize the Batmobile to progress through the story. But no. Turns out that the Batmobile is essential to many tasks in order to maneuver through the city and advance to the next checkpoint. Not a bad thing for someone who's used to driving games. But if you're a story driven gamer like me versus a gamer that likes to drive (pun intended), your possibly in for what can be a monotonous and sometimes difficult progression through the game.

Two story driven games come to mind where the developers inserted unnecessary driving tasks: One was Resistance Fall of Man where you had to drive the jeep; I hated that part and it took down what was otherwise one of the PS3's first and best story driven games. The other was Dead Space where you had to shoot the cannons at the incoming meteors; okay shooting meteors isn't driving but same concept of deviating from a normal progression through the story to an arcade-like exercise in tedium.

In the Batman series two games come to mind that Warner Brothers perfected: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Don't fix it if it ain't broken! Arkham Knight is a huge disappointment for me.",Batman the Driving Game,1436313600,37,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

1.0,True,"02 14, 2015",ATP6WW8SEH3ZX,B00J48MUS4,BP66,"First off, I waited to get this game since I usually wait to pay about half price but also because of the amount of problems that people said were there at launch so this review is after a lot of the launch problems were gone or at least should be gone.

The good parts of this game are the story, the architecture is pretty awesome, and the main character is likeable which has been the case in all except AC3, but other than that the game is a disappointment with nothing new, a lot of problems, and a lot of old aspects of previous games not included.

Problems:

1) The movement is glitchy.......and even when it doesn't glitch for the amount of running that you will do the movements are slow and labored......A faster movement system even if it is unrealistic is preferable than a slow one with unresponsive controls

2) Combat glitches....variety of them including none of the buttons responding

3) Disjointed side missions.......No continuity, each side mission is it's own quick mission that is easy, mostly negligible rewards, and most of the time can't hear or don't care what the point is......Really no point to do any of these unless you really need to get money which is easier to get by upgrading the base

4) Co-op Play.......If you don't have PS plus than you can't upgrade Arno all the way (I do have PS plus) as you need to play these missions to get him fully upgraded........Forces you to play with other people instead of letting you play a normal  single player campaign.....Basically these are the missions that should have been single player side missions in the game

5) You don't get to build a network of assassins to send out on contracts or missions which wasn't a great part of the other games that used this but is something that could be really cool if they made it more detailed and improved.......and it was at least somewhat interesting to have in the old games that had it

6) Micro-paying scam........not going to do it myself but just the fact that it is in the game is annoying........not rationale but I know other people who feel the same way about buying a game and than being asked to pay more into it, on top of the DLC if somebody chooses to buy that also

7) Numerous and long load times.......self explanatory but get ready to wait

8) Chests and Cockades........many of them with very little reason to collect

9) Enigmas.........These are nowhere near as fun as the Templar vaults or whatever they were called in the Ezio games (I think they were in the second Ezio Assassin Creed game).........Pretty much collect vague clues and try to remember what buildings are what or search the cluttered map for a name and click eagle vision and wait for the cool down to finish

10) Vantage points...They made these more interesting at some point in the series where some were/attached to Templar bases, again something that should be expanded on instead of thrown away

*****11) Your are in the French Revolution????.......Literally very little has happened to coincide with the historical even, I am on sequence 8 of 12 so maybe something later in the game makes the connection, but this late in the game and it has very little impact on the game........I had the same problem with the AC3 as you pick the setting and than your character is doing his own thing instead of making him influence the history etc etc

1.0,False,"10 15, 2015",A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B00E20STCK,Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"I remember when Spongebob video games had a decent track record. That was when THQ was still in business, but alas, they are gone now and Activision has stepped in to completely smash the franchise into the undersea floor. Spongebob Squarepants: Plankton's Millionth Attempt was the first game in the brand that Activision crapped out in as late as 2013 for pretty much every console under the sun except Playstation 4 and Xbox One (BOY they dodged a bullet here), and it shows. A LOT.

If there's anything I could give Plankton's Mindnumbing Disservice credit for, it's that the opening and ending cutscenes are pleasantly animated, and the music is fine enough on its own. Everything else about the game makes me wish Activision never grabbed a hold of the license to begin with.

The gameplay consists of some of the dullest platforming ever; all the platforming elements you ever do are running, jumping, pressing floor buttons, and repeat. However, because this is Activision, that isn't the main focus; that honor goes to SHOOTING instead. Yes, that's right; even Spongebob and friends can't escape the horrors of being published by the people that market Call of Duty. The weapons themselves are fictional blasters, mind you, but they are only present for you to shoot the same two or three types of robots over and over and over and over again. And the same ""mid-boss"" music jingle plays EVERY SINGLE TIME a gate blocks your path and you must kill robots to unlock it.

Nothing ever changes other than whether or not there'll be moving platforms, floor buttons that follow a super-easy pattern, or if the scenery decides to be different. The very repetitive and minimal level design is here and accounted for throughout the entire game without evolving a bit. Sure, you can provide slight upgrades to your weapon, but is that REALLY necessary in the grand scheme of things? Of course not. The best it ever does is waste a few LESS seconds of time per moment a group of enemies stop you from progressing.

Plankton's Shameless Cashgrab also has four boss battles, but they are all simply slight variations of each other; they all do the usual boss strategies that are as weak and dull as the levels you go through to get to them. Not only does nothing interesting ever happen, but the cutscenes that occur before and after beating the boss are as lazy as they can be; let's just have Spongebob and friends standing around a giant robot and cracking up bad jokes before declaring they'll go beat him!

Overall, this game is pretty much at the quality I've expected Activision to give it when I first heard they would be the new holders of the Spongebob license for video games. Seeing how the more recent game, Spongebob HeroPants, is just this made even worse, I think it's safe to say we won't ever be able to see a new Spongebob game that's any good, let alone as good as Battle for Bikini Bottom, ever again.",Plankton's Repetitive Wreck,1444867200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1.0,False,"08 5, 2004",A1KYZ36LVN6FZZ,B00003W865,Nicolas Green,"That's only in the first hour. Unfortunately, this childish cast of monsters follows you throughout your journey as Flint ""The Pirate Hunter"" in your quest to take down the ultimate evil in the form of a trollish frog-wizard. If you've ever wondered why there is no Alundra 3, all you need to do is try to make a single pass through this one.

 Gameplay:

 Alundra 2 completely breaks away from its predecessor by throwing away the old 2d engine and replaces it with a clunky 3d one. The control is directionally based, much like the original Parasite Eve, adding the ability to rotate your camera in 8 directions. Here, the first problem arises while playing. Should you have the need to rotate the camera while moving, you'll find yourself unable to change directions unless you stop moving completely. Movement is very clumsy in this game which compounds with Flint's sheer sluggish-ness. Now add the game's horrid clipping, and dodging enemies can sometimes be an impossibility. Which is a shame, since no matter how many hit points you have, odds are 6 hits (attacks or collisions) with an enemy will find you dead.

 Like the original, Alundra 2 is full of puzzles that require manipulation of the environment, and this clumsiness usually means that you'll be getting stuck running by diagonal walls or missing crucial jumps because you can't see where you're supposed to be going. The puzzles are also extremely easy until you get to around the 60% point of the game, at which point they actually take some thought. Which is good, because by that point the monsters and bosses become childishly easy, and without the more challenging puzzles, you'll be hard pressed to find reason to keep playing.

 Graphics:

 The move to a 3d engine was a bad one. The graphics in this game are just completely bland and uninspired. It's like taking all the bad parts of Granstream Saga and Threads of Fate and mixing them together. The polygonal characters are poorly rendered with bodies consisting of no more than ten polygons and the texture mapping is poorly done. There are no FMV's so-to-speak, with all the cut-scenes done with the game engine and the few movies being the game-engine on some other background. Definitely nothing to please your eyes while you slug through this one.

 Sound:

 The voice-acting in this game is surprisingly well done, albeit corny, and the list of actors is impressive with more than one recognizable voice in the mix. Unfortunately, the voices are the only upside since the music is uninspired at best. Be prepared for a lot of digitized oboes since the composer seems to love them more than is natural. Sound effects are par, they aren't annoying, nor do they rise out of this flavorless morass.

 Overall:

 If you're looking for a sequel to Alundra, this is not the game to you. Having gone through the entire game, there is not a single reference to Alundra or even to the Alundra world of Inoa. In fact the only thing that can be said to link the two games are the puzzles, but even then, these are much easier than the original. Even the original had a story that was dark and interesting, with Alundra being able to walk in people's nightmares and save their souls, but this one is pitiful and hackneyed. Basically, you are a pirate-hunter that teams up with a princess to save the kingdom from a court magician who goes awry. That's it, there's no side-story, back-story, or better-story ever revealed during gameplay.

 Basically put, I can take games with bad graphics, poor sound, shoddy gameplay or no story; I just can't take a game with all of those traits combined. In fact, the game will clock you in around 20 hours with the last 5 hours being no too bad. The problem is that the first 15 hours were absolutely horrid.

Air to Air Gunfire: A few direct bursts and blammo. Not only a disable but a kill.
Air to Surface missiles: Almost worthless.  A direct hit does not even disable most of the time.

The graphics are mediocre, Tyris's run speed is kinda fast, and Death Adder looks cool.  Everything else is terrible.  This game takes the worst elements of the original Golden Axe and slaps them together at a pathetic attempt to make a next gen game.

Story - 0/10
The game begins with Tyris walking through a barren valley by herself and realizing she's late for a huge ceremony where her Dragon God flies down from the sky and blesses her people.  She realizes that being late for this is probably a bad thing and starts to run, but encounters orc-like creatures called, ""BOOGEYMEN.""  Seriously, that's that they're called.  She battles her way through the BOOGEYMEN and arrives at the ceremony too late.  A group of BOOGEYMEN kill all of the priestesses, knock Tyris out, and kidnap her all mighty Dragon God.
- If your Dragon God gets kidnapped by a band of Orcs, it's time to get a new God.

Later Tyris awakens and the dwarf from the original game is there, pulling an axe out of his chest.  He sees Tyris and exclaims, ""By my balls, I thought you were dead.""  Ok, if you're a hot chick who was unconscious and the first thing you hear is a dwarf talking about his testicles, that's not a good thing.  Maybe he's saying he resurrected you somehow with his balls, or he is your father, or maybe that's just a contemporary Dwarven expression.  Anyway, the Dwarf gives Tyris an axe and says you must find the pieces and reassemble it.  Lucky for Tyris, the pieces just snap on.  Near the end of the game, Axe Battler from the original game appears and says something like, ""Gee, Tyris, I'm sorry your game sucks so bad.  See Ya,"" and he's gone.  I think there are 30 lines of bad dialogue in the entire story.

Gameplay  - 1/10
In this day and age, developers of real games put the player in an adventure and let them battle their way through it.  Golden Axe puts the player in a world and punishes them if they don't do what the designers intended.  No attempt is made to make a cohesive world.  Instead, the game just stops from time to time and says, ""Challenge Complete"" and gives you a score, usually telling you that you suck.  If you die during a Challenge, you have a LIMITED NUMBER OF CONTINUES that you can use or you must start over.  The game also makes every attempt to take cheap shots at the player:  Bombs hidden in objectives, poison hidden in chests, near impossible jumps...

Controls - 1/10
The controls are very awkward at best.
A - Jump, B - Mount Beast, X - Light Attack, Y - Heavy Attack, RB - Parry, LB - Evade, D-Pad - Choose Magic, L Trigger - Run, R Trigger - Magic, X+Y = Knockback Attack.
Combat relies heavily on pressing RB, LB, and X+Y.  Where do you put your hands to press RB, then X+Y immediately after that?!

Combat - 2/10
You begin AND END the game with 2 combos.  XXX for multiple enemies.  YYY to do damage to a single enemy.  If you delay your presses, you deal extra damage.  You can mix and match the X's and Y's, but there's no point.  You can't get new moves or new weapon types, so you'd better love pressing XXX or YYY.
Most of the focus of combat is on Defense, which is a lot less fun than thinking about slaughtering enemies.  There is NO BLOCK in the game.
Tyris can Parry or Evade.  The enemy attacks are color coded.  Orange Attacks can be Evaded, Blue can be parried.  If you are successful, you can counter attack for extra damage.  If you try to Parry a Blue or Evade an Orange, Tyris just stands there and gets beaten up.  If no attacks are coming at you, THE BUTTONS DO NOTHING AND YOU ARE IMMOBILE FOR 2 SECONDS.  If you are attacking, the Parry and Evade don't take effect until the animation ends, so the best way to fight is to stand still, Parry or Evade, then attack.  Boy, I bet you can't wait to experience that!  There is no combat manager in the game, so Tyris can be attacked by a Blue and Orange at the same time, which means you get hit and lose your bonus.  This reminds Tyris that the world is cruel and unfair.

Beasts - 3/10
Beasts are only in the game about 10% of the time.  The beasts are sluggish and clunky and they only have 3 attacks each.  X, Y, and X+Y.  In some cases, using the X+Y attack drains the beast's health.  The beasts are disposable and if Tyris gets knocked off a beast, the weakest enemy can jump on it and ride it, to remind her that she is not special.

Leveling Up - 0/10
At the end of each challenge, you accumulate Gold.  If you defend well, you get a bonus to the gold that you pick up.  If you get hit once, the bonus drops to zero.  This is very frustrating.  When you complete a level, you get graded based on damage taken, gold, time, and dismemberment.  If you play on NORMAL MODE, the game multiplies your gold by 1/3!!!!!!  You only keep 1/3 of your GOLD!!!  The background for this screen should have been a giant middle finger!  (Hard Mode is x1)
Getting gold, fills a bar at the bottom of the screen.  When that fills up, you get what the game decides to give you.  You usually get a new outfit for Tyris that looks the same as the one she already has.  This reminds Tyris that no matter how hard she tries, she will never get ahead in the world.

Level Design - 0/10
Every level looks the same.  From the rocky barren plains, to the dusty barren plains dotted with ruins.  In every level, there are spikes that randomly pop in and out of the ground for no apparent reason.  Absolutely no attempt is made to make this look like a world.  Instead the levels are there to take cheap shots at Tyris.  In some levels, while riding a dinosaur, the wind can blow you and the dino off of the cliff.
Opening doors is incredibly confusing.  There are 9 different ways to open doors, but there is only 1 way to open each door, and you never really know how you are supposed to open them.
If you ever get lost, the best way to tell if you are headed in the right direction is the slow down.  The game drops frames to load in enemies.  So, if the game suddenly pauses for a second, that's a good thing.  There are invisible walls everywhere, so the levels may look like mass expanses of dirt, but they're linear dirt trails surrounded by dirt.

Bosses 1/10
Almost all the bosses are the same guy.  It's a 60 foot tall giant that you attack.  After you hit him a few times, he crouches.  When he crouches, Tyris kicks him and he goes flying backwards into a fire column to take damage.  If Tyris can move a 60 foot tall giant with a kick, why can't she jump more than 5 feet?  Perhaps the bosses are made of helium.

Bugs - 10/10
I've seen Tyris get stuck in level geometry.  I've seen the game crash.  I've heard the sound skip.  I've seen Tyris fall out of the world.  There are render tears and slowdown.  I've also seen an entire palette shift to blue.

Sound - 5/10
The music is ok, but neither feels epic nor atmospheric.

The Ending - 0/10
Tyris catches up with her captured Dragon God and he tells her the final piece of the axe is his soul.  She stabs him in the head and does her best Darth Vader Episode 3, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""  I laughed for a minute.  Then you fight Death Adder.  The fight is 20 minutes long and makes no sense.  But, that's ok because the fight pauses every few minutes and pop-up windows appear giving you detalied instructions on what you are supposed to be doing.  Hit him, ride him, make him destroy some statues, then a cutscene plays where Death Adder says, ""Fool, I will destroy you!""  Tyris replies, ""Maybe, but not this day!""  Seriously, that's what she says.  She chops his head off.  Your reward...  a skimpy white bikini costume.  So, the final scene plays and the Dwarf and Axe are there.  Tyris says, ""I've lost my land, my god, my people...""  But it's hard to take her seriously because she looks like `Fun in the Sun' Tyris who's about to go play beach volleyball and drink something with a little umbrella in it.  Axe Battler says, ""This is just the beginning.""  The dwarf starts to talk, but is abruptly cut off by the credits.  That's right, the credits interrupt the last cutscene.

The game is rated M for violence, gore, and nudity.  Unfortunately, the nudity is only on dead, charred, or dismembered bodies.  If you're going to put breasts in a game, put them on living women so the non-necrophiliacs can enjoy them, too.

If you're dying to play a hack and slash game, you should play Ninja Gaiden 2, Devil May Cry 4, Oblivion, Too Human, Viking, The Force Unleashed, Lego Star Wars, Assassin's Creed... then buy a Wii and play Zelda and No More Heroes... then buy Castle Crashers on the Xbox Marketplace... You're better off avoiding this game.

If you feel you must play it, it's only 6-8 hours long and not very difficult.

The game installed fine - I was able to quickly log in and start playing, first on my MacBook then on my PC. So the game does work, but this is basically the only good thing about it. For the next few days I have created few cities, fully grown, with full coverage by police/fire department, without any major traffic problems, with a well-working Electronics industry being fed by my recycling plants, never-ending water supply (yes, sewage treatment plants do replenish the waterbed fast enough) and more money income than I was able to spend on anything else.

After you hit that point - there is absolutely nothing else to do. You can't grow the city beyond a tiny pre-defined area, all you can do is help the few neighboring players... if they are still playing the game and did not also quit due to boredom. If not - you can start another city, get it to the same level of economical ""stability"", upgrade/research whatever you are able to (given the tiny limited city area), get bored after a couple of days again. There is absolutely no serious long-term replayability to it, regardless of useless ""multiplayer"" part, all you can hope for are future cosmetic ""DLCs"" adding in few new buildings with new functionalities which you will get bored of after a day or so.

When the original Mass Effect came out for the Xbox 360, I fell in love with it!

Yes, the graphics were not ""smooth"" and the concept of shooter-RPG was new at the time. However, I fell in love with character developments. I loved the fact that most of the Non-Playable Characters (NPC's) that I talked to had a story; and they didn't just have a bland story, their stories were deep and very interesting. These stories would vary on your choices; so, naturally, I played the game three times...thats right, THREE times just to see how the game would change with different choices. I loved the original Mass Effect, and Mass Effect 2 was even better. Mass Effect 2 added even more depth to the story. I could care less about Shepard, it was all about the choices that I made in original Mass Effect that mattered more. I spent more time with Mass Effect 2 than any other game since 2006.

I am not going to discuss the graphics, the sound, or even the ""special edition stuff"". I want to review about what Mass Effect series has been about (for me anyways): the story with character development.

A good story is good from the beginning to the end. You develop your Mass Effect story with the original ME, continue with ME2, and then you have ME3...which is suppose to be the end of your story. In ME3, Earth and many other planets are under attack, and Shepard is given the task of  building alliances with other races to take down the reapers for good. As you travel the galaxy to build alliance, ME3 does a fantastic job of implementing your decisions made in ME/ME2 with that of ME3...and believe me, your decisions in ME/ME2 does have an impact in ME3!

ME3 DID everything brilliantly, except the end. You created a story which lasts across three games, but the end is like...well, lets just say your story/choices/decisions simply didn't matter at all. You make ""good"" or ""renegade"" decisions, or build all those relationships with your teammates hoping for a respective closure, but you are treated with one generic ending.

Personally, with a series like Mass Effect (deep story/character building), I would have been happy with a few sentences saying what happens 10-years after your big fight or what happens to your squad...but nope, nothing like that. There are three endings...actually, its just one ending with three different colors.

I have spent countless hours with the original Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2...making different decisions, making sure I get the best rating, making sure everyone is happy. They were absolutely fantastic games!

Can the same be said for Mass Effect 3? No. I don't think I will even play it again. You can tell that EA and Bioware rushed through the game (most of my ME2 characters were killed in ME3) so they can focus on DLC's. Keep your olive branches EA/Bioware, if I want to play ME3 DLC's, I may consider buying a used copy of Mass Effect 3 ""Game of the Year Edition"" when its $10 on Ebay.",Mass Disappointment,1331856000,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

However, be advised that this game - even the boxed DVD edition - requires authentication through the Steam online system, and once that game is registered to your Steam account, it can't be ""unregistered"" or used by any other (new) Steam account.

I've been in contact with Steam's woefully inadequate tech support - only available through email - and was so advised.

When you create a Steam account (for those, like me, who are unfamiliar with it) you have to authenticate your account through an email verification process. That means that if you want to transfer the account - which would be necessary if you want to give or sell your game to someone else when you're done playing it - you'd have to be directly involved in manipulating the system to give that third party access to and control over the Steam account you created. Further, you can't delete or cancel your Steam account.

What this means, for all practical purposes, is that this game is designed to be playable only by the original purchaser.

Now, I don't know about you, but when I buy any other property - books, movies, cars, houses, whatever - when I'm done with them, I can sell or give them to someone else to enjoy. That, after all, is one of the key elements of actually ""owning"" a piece of property.

Well... not so with this game. You're paying fifty bucks to essentially RENT this game on a permanent basis.

I don't care how good it is. Steam bites, and that makes this a terrible value for the money, and consequently worth only one star. I'd give it negative stars if I could.

So I called Microsoft to see if I can have it repaired only to get the answer that my warranty had expired mere days ago.  They did however offer to repair the system for half the price of a brand new system ($100 the new xbox 360 being released in a month retails at $199) with no mention of an upgraded warranty after this one would have gotten fixed.

1.0,False,"03 24, 2010",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00452VGZW,Aiex Halo,"Two things to note as of now: Review is subject to change as I advance in gameplay.

The negative of this game is just too much for me to sit back and wait out more gameplay.  However, as I can edit the star rating and content of reviews, I may edit this to be of a sharply different tone later.

However, even this early in the game, I can say this game is tragic, in the sense that the seeming attempts at something ""new"" and revolutionary are its downfall.

First I want to note that ""NEW"" and ""INNOVATIVE"" doesn't automatically correlate to ""GOOD"".  Replacing an assault rifle with a bolt-action laser gun is NEW and INNOVATIVE, but you're sure as hell not going to consider the laser gun superior to the assault rifle just because of that.

And so, C&C4 has apparently taken from the Dawn of War II gameplay style.  Namely, virtually 30-40% of the gameplay of a normal C&C game is now gone.

That is not a good thing---base management wasn't just a fun timewaster of balancing power plants with technology buildings and such; the building of buildings made it possible to establish yourself on a field of battle and realistically deal with things like attrition, travel, re-supply and reinforcement issues in travel, and defense in numbers.  By that, the numerous buildings you have essentially is their best defense when your troops and defensive buildings fail---the enemy will target your War Factory, so you can mass-build powerful infantry to destroy them once they're finished.

Here, there's only one building, the poorly named ""Crawler"".  I say poorly named because it rarely ever crawls, and there's three models of it---one model has wheels, the other flies.

This is your construction yard, power plant, war factory, tech center, barracks, everything but defensive buildings, which can be built separately.

This means if you lose it, you're gone.  I think you can deploy a new one if you lose one, but you essentially have to start over again in terms of ""base"" construction and technology.

While it wasn't realistic to magically create a military city out of a big fat truck, neither is it realistic to conduct an entire battle on 5 tanks and a big fat truck that deploys into a fortress and packs up with absolutely no consequences in terms of time, money, credit, points, anything.

Even worse, there's NO mixing and matching of units.  That means, if you pick one Crawler type, all you'll get is tanks.  If you pick a different one, all you'll get is infantry.  The other one, all you'll get is air units.

A slight mention: Graphics.

Graphics are nowhere near as cartoony as other reviewers are mentioning.  The landscape comes nowhere close to the bright, frilly colors of Red Alert 3, and is much closer to the original Command & Conquer 3, but with a fresh vibrancy to the tones that is not only much more pleasant to look at from the bleak shades of gray and beige of C&C3, but slightly more realistic.

The units, however, is where the cartooniness is apparent...

They've undergone the same process by which the units of Red Alert transformed in Red Alert 2.  Namely, they're like caricatures of their old selves, made stout and fat where they were once lean and limber.

The Scorpion tank has literally been redesigned to look like a scorpion, complete with claws and a stinger.  It's just too stupid-looking to take seriously.  A flying unit literally looks and moves like a wasp with its stinger underneath it.  It's just too comical to consider a threat.  Raiders are shorter, stouter, and overall fatter than they used to be.  Stealth Tanks no longer look sleek and stealthy, but their missile boxes are now huge and clunky-looking.  Avatars no longer look lean and dangerous, but have their arms needlessly stiffened, and made to stick out on their sides, like 1950s cardboard refridgerator robots rather than the loose, limber cyborg that could grab things in C&C3.  C&C4's Avatar couldn't pick up anything.

There is a tactic that I feel made the Age of Empires II knockoff ""Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds"" impossible to enjoy; it was a gamebreaker that the expansion pack ""Clone Campaigns"" just disgustingly exacerbated to such a degree that anyone who used this tactic would almost always win, guaranteed:

Fortressing.  That is, the building of heavy buildings capable of production very close to an enemy base, camping out there, and mass-building as much artillery as you can to blow apart an enemy base without them ever able to stop you without loads and loads of units and the sacrifice of several buildings.

That is the ONLY tactic you can do here.  Another reviewer mentioned turtling was an option, but this tactic is weak and pathetic---you're SEVERELY limited in the number of anything you can build, and any determined enemy can crush your turtled base unless you have all your forces there to counter them.  This COMPLETELY defeats the purpose of turtling to begin with.

But what really destroys the game is the unit caps.  Not at all going by the more player-friendly Blizzard Starcraft or Warcraft II limit of 200 population, this game will arbitrarily established a limit that is made further tinier by the fact that the SINGLE MOST BASIC TANK YOU CAN BUILD TAKES UP SIX POP POINTS!  SIX!

Another reviewer argued that this was a good thing, for it reduced the dreaded TANK SPAM that would propogate earlier C&C games.  I point out strongly that it propogated EARLY C&C games.  The more recent games had better balance for countering this.  Just yesterday I was playing a mission in Red Alert 3 Uprising where I attempted a tank spam attack on a Japanese enemy, and because I was so numerous, they were able to destroy large swaths of my tanks, due simply to the fact that there were so many of them, they could be easily destroyed in cross-fire and splash damage.

But the restrictions here are TOO MUCH!  In just the third mission, the first where I choose GDI, I'm expected to defend 12 refugee trucks going all the way across the map.  Along the way, enemy forces appear EEEEEVERYYWHEEEEERE to attack them.  And I only have 9 units to defend them with.

I'm literally rushing these 5 tanks and 4 infantry all across the map back and forth while they dangle between red health and orange health, just to DISTRACT enemy guns from shooting at refugee trucks.

This mission shows that the general gameplay, short of a one on one encounter, is not at all a test of who has the better command ability and strategies, but who has the most units---it doesn't matter if my units are better or I am a human against a computer AI, they have more than one Crawler, so they can produce more units, so I cannot win, period.

GDI, the technological powerhouse, is reduced to having what a ragtag milita would consider a piece of trash outfit, HARASSING NOD FORCES to keep them from destroying TWELVE REFUGEE TRUCKS.

Tragic.

In fact, the very next mission is yet another exercise in face-palming stupidity, fortressing tactics, and nothing to do but literally TANK SPAM!  Because the tanks would get killed just as quickly as they were produced.  And the mission after that was like the first one---you need to capture THREE TCNs, in much the same way you would Control Points in Dawn of War.  Every five minutes, TWO NOD Crawlers spawn.  When they do, they start insta-building units, and rushing at you and the TCNs.  There is no strategy or tactics to be had here other than to destroy the crawlers and run as fast as you can to secure all three of them at once, which gives you no way to counter ANYTHING ANYWHERE.",Tragic game,1269388800,6,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
1.0,True,"10 8, 2012",A3SMWBV1QHQ3AA,B0015HZLVA,Chris,"First off, I love RPGs and I was once near-fluent in Japanese and lived in Nagoya for a year. I studied the culture and was at a time really into anime, so I understand a lot of the pitfalls that typical Americans don't really get when it comes to entertainment from Japan. I played the demo and while it was pretty short, it seemed fun and light-hearted. I didn't want to try to play the game in Japanese because I'm a bit rusty, so I bought the English version. And I want to be real clear: this game just sucks. I'm about to get mean.

There's a lot of the prototypical childishness that's present in almost all anime. However, this isn't Studio Gibli quality ""wonderment from a child's perspective"" kind of childishness. No, it's the ""a 5 year old came up with this story"" kind. These characters are cardboard cutouts borrowed from the infamous one-dimensional list of archetypes that constitute most anime casts. The characters are trite and hackneyed and make the game feel like it was intended for very, very young children who can't appreciate deeper characterizations. And they're not helped by the dialog, which is poorly translated from Japanese. If you happen to speak the language, the game plays with a constant and ever-gnawing sense of ""I could have done better."" If you don't, I have a feeling that it plays with little more than a sense of ""What? The? Eff?"". I can always tell exactly where the errors are and how they were made. It's like someone attacked the original text with a first-year dictionary, picked the first possible translation on a word-by-word basis instead of translating the whole sentence and picking the best ones, and then didn't bother going back and trying to actually make the story make sense in English. And the idioms are horrible. A lot of Japanese idioms are culturally ingrained and just do not work in English, but, in true first-year fashion, the translator tried to force it, which results in this constant flurry of ""why did they just say that?"". And then I have to remember that this wasn't originally in English. On top of that, most of the script is barely even grammatically correct. I don't understand how the voice actors said most of this stuff. Do they have no self-respect? Did nobody question the translation? Do they turn their brains off when they read their scripts? This seems the most likely, as most of the dialog is delivered extremely stiffly, which makes me question the reviewers who said it was good. Were they reviewing the original Japanese voice cast? Because the English is terrible. Just. Terrible.

There's almost as little feeling in the speech as there is in the characters' faces. The character models just run around the screen like vaudeville idiots, with more lanky-armed slapstick humor than actual witty dialog. It might be that the wit was consumed by the horrendous translation, I don't know. Either way, it wouldn't annoy me so much if there was some expression, but the faces on the models Never. Change. They just blink with this wide-eyed, blank-faced stare that's pure, unadulterated creepy. The only time there's ever any expression is when you get to watch the pop-up cut scenes that randomly trigger throughout the game. And even then, it's not animated. It's very detached with individual pictures for the characters that are involved. Whenever a character ""reacts"" to what another one is saying, their picture might change, or move around the screen or shake. But it's never *animated*. For me, that just creates a big disconnect. If I wanted unanimated character stills, I'd be reading a manga, not holding a controller.

White-knuckled holding a controller, I should say. I'm not a controller-chucker, but I have to fight the urge for most of the game. In typical JRPG fashion, the bulk of the game is extruded through near-constant combat encounters. You can pick and choose what you fight just by avoiding touching enemies (except on the world map, where monsters can just appear in front of you before you can dodge). However, once you're in the combat cloud you'll find pretty quickly that it's atrocious. Your role in battle is very much active, and you have to constantly perform combos. Most of your combat will involve using basic attacks so that you can charge your TP meter and perform special moves. However, the character can only perform a maximum of 3 strikes in a row. And no matter how many strikes you choose to use, wheter it be 1, 2, or the ""full"" (pathetic) 3, once you're done he does this incredibly idiotic dance where he tosses his sword around his body. During this time you cannot do ANYTHING. You cannot move, block, use items, or use abilities. Not that blocking is ever really useful, but this means that you're left defenseless EVERY SINGLE TIME you use a basic attack without leading into a special move combo. And even then, I think he still does his sword dance after special moves. Either way, you're defenseless for a hugely asinine amount of your time in combat. I cannot get over how @#$()@#)$%(&* stupid this is.

During the opening hours of the game, it's not a problem because enemies generally drop quickly and are very weak. Within a few short hours they'll drop with just two or three hits, making these short combos useful. However, once you get up to the first real boss fight, it starts to get very annoying. Like a lot of games that have come out in the past decade, this one makes bosses several times more powerful than the surrounding area's enemies (something that annoys the hell out of me: make the normal enemies harder or the bosses weaker, but don't surprise me with a random pounding... that's not what I'm paying for when I buy a game). So you may think you're doing pretty daggum well, kicking butt and not bothering to take names, and then you turn a corner and find your own familiar seat-warmer sitting cheeks-side-up on a platter being served back to you for lunch with a side of whoopass. During boss fights, your TP meter runs out in a hurry because you're trying to use as mnany combos as you can while ineffectually dealing damage. Meanwhile, your party members are dropping like flies because they're utterly useless AI-controlled trash. So once you run out of allies, any means to revive or heal them, and finally out of TP, you're stuck trying to recharge with ultra-short combos that render you defenseless. If you attack and get blocked, you're doubly screwed because not only have you not dealt any measurable damage, but then you go and do the ""I'm @#$%@#$% Stupid"" sword-toss dance. This is the exact moment that the boss opens up with a much-more-than-3-hit combo that punishes you for spending any amount of money on this crappy game.

Once you're done surgically reattaching your rump, you're free to try to level up. But most areas just don't have powerful enough enemies, and the game will concoct some bizarre reason why you can't leave the area to go find stronger enemies. After scrounging for 20, 30, 60 minutes to get a single level, you go up against the boss for a rematch and last all of an extra 10 seconds - maybe taking an additional 5% of the boss' health - before the same thing happens. I squeaked by the 1st boss on the first try, had to retry the second boss (some kind of golem) 2 or 3 times before I got him, and finally got to the 3rd boss (some kind of cokatrice-looking mofo). Once you get stuck on the route to this SOB, there are all of 5 enemeis that will not respawn unless you run to the save point, save, and reload the game. This makes grinding out that level extra-stupid-annoying. I spent some insane number of eye-clawingly boring hours trying to get a level that ultimately didn't matter, and I saved, turned off the Xbox and haven't picked the game back up since.

I hate games that force level grinding, and this one is pretty bad about it. It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that for however many hours I've forced into this pile of garbage, there are only about 8 enemy models that come in 2-3 flavors each. It's bland. Just bland. The only thing good about fighting so many monsters is all the little prizes they drop.

There's a neat little equipment management system that lets you upgrade your weapons and armor, and if you're out in the wild you can 'cook' meals with ingredients dropped by monsters that heal or lend certain effects to your party. However, there's not a whole lot of reward to it and the system gets bogged down in the minutia pretty quickly. It's not quite as bad as Dragon's Dogma in terms of sheer bredth of available items, but I don't remember it being as simple or straight-forward, either. In Dragon's Dogma, you can upgrade any item at any time so long as you have the proper materials (which the blacksmith will identify for you, even if you've never seen it) and the right amount of gold, and ""learning"" combinable item recipes just involves finding the components (having owned both at some point will tell that you can make something, the first attempt to do combine them will tell you what it makes). In Tales, it seems like upgrades are unlocked as you progress through the game, and figuring out what does what and whether or not it's worth it is a die roll. And the 'cooking' skill is just crap. Even if you manage to learn a recipe, the characters are apparently all inept and almost never get it right. Leveling has a neglible (if any) effect on this, so you just burn through materials. And it doens't seem to matter if a character claims to be a good cook, they still suck. If you're caught with your pants down by a SURPRISE! (super) boss and don't have a lot of useful combat-worthy items, the 'cooking' option will NOT save you.

I'm not really looking forward to finishing the game, either, because even if I do the rest of it perfectly I won't get all the achievements. I have to play through at least twice, maybe even three times. I just don't like games that force multiple playthroughs to get all the achievements. A game should stand on its own merits to warrant a second visit (like any of the Halos), not numb players' minds with a full lather-rinse-repeat that lacks any difference, takes just as long to complete, and yields some arbitrary and insulting paltry amount of ""gamer score"" for your effort (like Mass Effect 1 & 3). This just compounds my annoyance with the game, because I can't be one-and-out if I ever DO bother to pick this turd back up.

The game was launched in a semi-beta state, the servers used to play it (being online only) were also apparently poorly set up and planned, as many, many people had issues for a few days after launch (unable to connect, loosing connection often, obscene amounts of lag, ect). The item system (which basicly MADE D2 the legend that it is) is fubar, the item prices on the Auction House are hyper-inflated, due to hackers and item duplication already becoming a problem (funny that was the main, if not one of the main, reason's why blizzard didn't give us an offline / true single-player mode.. they claimed it was to make hacking/exploits harder to do)

The auction house is apparently what blizzard -really- built the game around, as they will make money off of every (real money) transaction that goes thru on it. The game itself is incredibly short and easy to max level on (i was level 60, the current level cap, within 3 days of semi-casually playing). Inferno difficulty, the supposed ""end game"" of D3, is hard and unbalanced to the point of being..well.. pointless.

Character customization and differant builds/playstyles? also gone. Everybody gets the same skils, at the same time, with the same potency. The only difference is what gear you are using, which will -ONLY- increase your skill's damage, or your vitality (hit points) or your resistence to various types of damage. So everybody will wind up basicly playing the same character class. EVERYbody. The 3 diff mercs you can hire once you find them? Also next to useless once you get into the later stages of the game, simply because they don't scale that well in relation to your own character, and the only thing you can do to improve them is their weapon, and 3 pieces of gear (amulet and 2 rings)

To summerize, the only improvement they've made over D2 is the music / sound effects, and to a lesser extent, the graphics.

Now, it wears down your gear simply by destroying objects in the environment. What this means is essentailly they are putting an IN-GAME GOLD TAX on everything you do or are subjected too (fighting, breaking/opening containers/objects, dying) while reducing the amount of gold/magic items, or the chance to get them.","A good franchise, semi-ruined by corporate greed",1339891200,20,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

It was encompassing, awe inspiring, it had varied levels, it was pretty non-linear, the levels were lengthy yet doable.  It was basically a fun all around game.  So Jak 2 comes out, and they made a lot of changes, all for the worse.
First off, I guess the marketing folks told the developers to emulate Grand Theft Auto 3.  Let me tell you, this does not work.  GTA had a living-breathing city that fit into the environment.  What does Jak 2 have?  It was a non-descript closed off city with hardly anything in it.  The worst is the movement throughout the city.  To go to a different a different part of the city, you need take this horrible ""hover vehicle"" that apparently can't hover beyond ""up"" or ""down"".  The movements of this vehicle are sluggish, slow, and uncontrollable, and the vehicle itself doesn't possess any subtlety.  Couple this with the fact that all the missions are clear cross the city, and the alleyways are small, and you've got one boring, annoying game.  I passed maybe 10 levels, and most of my time was spent hovering between those levels.
Secondly, in GTA fashion, they decided to make it ""gritty"".  Oh geez, give me a break.  Who was begging for a cartoon platformer to be gritty?  Why does Jak need to cuss?  I don't mind it, but it serves no other purpose other than to alienate a chunk of potential gamers.  The ""gritty"" factor might have been an excuse as to why they could not re-produce the lush, varied environments that really made the first game.  Every level I played looked the same, either an indoor level or an outdoor level.
Okay, so the environment and movement is no good, what about the missions you say?  Well, these missions are tedious missions and designed to be repeated over and over again.  Some of the missions are easy, but you basically go through the same jumps and enemies over and over again.  Many are difficult, made so that you have to die a few times, repeat what you just accomplished, just to die a little bit later.  While not hard, but if the missions were any fun, it wouldn't be so bad.
Finally, the first game required you to reach a certain number of spheres for you to pass.  Whatever way you wanted to get them, you could.  This meant that if a mission was boring, not fun, or out of the way, you could skip and try something else.  This game pretty much is linear.  It's sort of de-evolution of video gaming right here.
So, in short, what was once an original, fun, lush platform game now spawned a sequel which is no more than a badly designed conglomeration or random gaming ideas.
Pros:
Uhmm, I can't think of any.

In addition, this new ""slam"" mechanic is awful. It's mapped to triangle, the same button as grind, so you can only guess how that feels when you're trying to hit a rail and instead you press it a second too soon or something and just slam to the ground instead.

The one positive? The physics actually feel good this time. Gone are the crap physics from THPS HD. So that begs the question, why would they improve the physics to feel more like the originals, therefore pretty much nailing the gameplay of the old games, only to completely ruin the flow of the gameplay with the slam move? It boggles the mind.

Also, the soundtrack sucks. Absolute, unadulterated trash from what I've heard.

As much as we've seen made of the glitches on the internet, I haven't experienced those. I experienced some goofy ragdolls, though. That said, what ruins this game is not the glitches, nor the physics that tarnished THPS HD, but it's things that could and should have been avoided but weren't.

Pros:
Physics feel correct, therefore the gameplay isn't as off as in THPS HD
While real bad, it's still better than those crap peripheral games like Ride and Shred

Cons:
Level design is absolute trash
Slam mechanic ruins the flow of the otherwise decent gameplay
Framerate is all over the place
Graphics, as we expected, are low-end PS3/Xbox 360
Soundtrack isn't memorable like the earlier games and is full of stinkers

Guys, this one's bad -- like real bad! I could forgive the crappy slam mechanic, a bad soundtrack, and some performance hitches and mediocre graphics, but when the level design is so amateur and slipshod, why even bother playing it? These levels feel like they were made in the level creator without any care or thought put into them at all. The level design alone is enough to earn this game a 1/5.

I'm not a super harsh person, and I often enjoy lower budget games, so I was willing to give this game the benefit of the doubt and thought that perhaps it'd have some redeeming qualities even if it had a lot of flaws, but the level design alone completely makes this game a waste of your time and my time.

1.0,True,"11 20, 2010",ATIVK9XUANIUE,B003R7H5TC,Corey,"Need for Speed Hot Pursuit does so many things exceptionally well but fails to do other things even in an acceptable way. The graphics are beautiful; Cars look amazing and the weather effects make you feel like you are there riding on a rainy mountain or through a thunderous desert at night. Driving mechanics are also fun. Learning when to time your drifts and when to use your turbo is compelling. Also you'll find a terrific soundtrack accompanied by just as impressing sound effects from vehicles.

So where does this game go wrong? Let's start with the wheel. No wheel support in a racing game is absurd. This point need not be argued. What next? Rock Band without guitar peripheral support?

Next complaint is about the traffic. Usually there isn't much traffic in the game but the traffic is placed in the worst spots. On a two lane road, two vehicles will cross beside each other exactly when you need to pass. Nearly every turn a car appears right in your drift/ turning radius. This happens in lots of arcade racers. Midnight Club is notorious for this and it ruins the experience in that game and this one too.

Another problem with traffic is the speed of the game and the resulting pop up effect. So many races I'm going over 220mph and suddenly am slamming into a car I never saw. Hills create this problem most frequently as you can't see what's beneath you on a hill. This problem also plagues shortcuts. For whatever reason the developers placed a gigantic rock in the center a lot of shortcuts. This rock usually is visible only right before your smashing into it at 200+mph.

Autolog is a neat feature that interfaces the game in a competitive way amongst you and your friends. Only problem is the autolog is seemingly pointless. In the career mode most of the events are so challenging that you'll rarely have friends that do better than those times, so you may as well just chase those goals instead. Also I haven't found any leaderboards, so it seems they traded in a global system for people to compete with others for a smaller local system. It's an interesting feature that I was impressed with but why step backwards when your stepping forwards? They should have also instituted global leaderboards.

There is also online multiplayer, probably the best part of the game. Rarely do you find a game where playing online is easier than the career mode, but in this case I play online to take a break from the frustration of going for various gold medals and distinctions. I typically only play Hot Pursuit online as it is most enjoyable and is the only portion of this game that a casual gamer would appreciate.

Overall the game is overly frustrating as the experience is too plagued by problems aforementioned to be enjoyed or considered worth the asking price.

Very poor quality statues (splattered paint, wobbly statues) and the metal works statue is about 30 flimsy metal sheets you have to attempt to assemble yourself, if you are lucky it might stay together.

In addition the Microsoft process for ordering the replacement discs will take over an hour (it did for me due to their multi-step verifications, poor communications and requirements such as knowing your console serial number and NOT using a google voice number since Microsoft has decided to reject them as numbers.

So in my case I literally spent an hour on the phone with Microsoft support to try to exchange my code for a disc to have the final question asked ""what is your console id""  which I replied ""I don't have it yet it's on order, won't arrive until next week"" to which they replied ""we can't send discs without a console ID"".  Really?  What does my console ID have to do with receiving discs for a game?

It's pretty obvious that Microsoft doesn't get it.  They charge 150 premium for a 25-50 dollar hollow statue made entirely of thin plastic (sure other CEs are as well but they cost 1/2 this much) and then refuse to properly honor their statement that all you need to provide is the game code to swap.  That's not the case here.

The overall mechanics are those of a normal FPS but with cool additional features such as wall running, Titans and a couple others. What totally killed this game for me was the lack of a Campaign mode. Before others tell you there is a Campaign mode and this is false, let me explain. So ""technically"" the game offers what they think is a Campaign mode but really just another Multiplayer mode.

A typical Campaign mode to me is:
*One player mode with the option of co-op sometimes
*Great story line with engaging cut-scenes
*The ability to pause and pick up where you left off
*Somewhat linear story in that you have to complete Mission 1 to proceed to Mission 2 and so on

A typical Multiplayer mode to me is:
*Usually online focused
*Multiple players are required
*You can choose any map or mode you like
*No story line

Here is TitanFall's Campaign mode:
*Online focused
*Multiple players required (No user level moderation so you will play your first time at level 1 against a level 42 user)
*No story line or engaging cut-scenes
*No ability to pause and pick up where you left off
*100% linear story in that you have to complete Mission 1 to proceed to Mission 2 and so on

As you can see, there is absolutely nothing that makes the so-called Campaign mode anything different than a Multiplayer mode. It is Multiplayer 1 and 2 mode. The only thing different I can recall is that instead of starting on the ground on the level and your goal being displayed on your screen (something like ""Kill all your enemies to complete this mission) you are in a helicopter and a voice tells you ""You must kill all the enemies to complete this mission"". They then drop you on the ground! I completed three missions and still have no clue what the premise of the story is besides kill the other team before they kill you.

Putting it bluntly, EA and Respawn are absolute idiots if they think this game offers a Campaign mode. Lol, it was probably the producers of NBA Live who worked on this game.

I wisely waited and took in feedback from my friends who had purchased the game. After three weeks, none of them were exactly raving about the game. I was surprised. They loaned me the game and I thought for sure that they were not describing the game to its fullest. Well, was I wrong. First the positives. The graphics are amazing. The music and the sound effects are first rate, so no complaints there. Now the negatives. It's such an accurate depiction of the old west that it's just down right boring. Riding to get to each town is just so boring. Sure you shoot some birds, skin a few animals, whoo hoo. Then you even stop to pick a few flowers. Gee how exciting. So when I encoutered some battles, I thought this would be fun. But instead, I just feel as though I was going through the motions. The storylines were not even interesting. Helping a crooked salesman ride back through town while being shot at? Getting some medicine for that religious woman? Wasn't even exciting. Most of the time, I felt as though as I was wondering around the wild with no goals at all. C'mon, racing to see who is faster on the horse? Why do I care?? I realize that if they had bandits jumping out of every corner rock, it wouldn't be realistic. Then what really got to me was the chronolgy. It says it takes place in 1910, but it feels older. Why 1910? Why not the late 1890's? It just didn't make any sense to me to have it at the beginning of the century when automobiles were starting to come around and the majority of the population was already using the train. The game certainly feels older than 1910. So I don't know. This game was just one big snooze fest. I'd rather play Cliff Diving Monkeys online. At least that game was exciting. This is one big snooze fest in the west. Save your money people and just rent this one.","DO NO BELIEVE THE HYPE, ITS A SNOOZE FEST IN THE WEST",1282694400,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The combat is a step back. Two steps back. Three steps back. In fact, it is the worst combat in *any* AC game. Even AC1 had better combat, and the combat in that game was atrociously bad. Gone is the fluid exciting combat of AC2, 3, and 4. The combat here is a long, tedious, boring, slog.

I couldn't believe how terrible the 'The Tournament' mission was. It decides to introduce 'timed parkour'. But the controls in this game, particularly when trying to run and be precise, and make jumps at specific objects near other jump able objects, are abysmally bad.

Whoever decided to implement the sewers in this game should be fired. The AC games are about the joy of the fluid, limitless, high speed rooftop traversal of exciting locations- mixed in with a judicious amount of assassinations.

I figured a 007 game with RPG leveling system mechanics should make a great game. I was wrong in the end though. First off I won't go into a full on review because there are a few others that have already done that, I will give you a short reason why I didn't like the game. For positive reviews or pros instead of cons read another review. The main problems i had with the game is that for a stealth game it doesn't take much at all for the enemy to know your exact location. I have had too many times to count where I would be crouched by a crate and aiming in for a headshot and someone across level will see me somehow. Not only that but once they have seen you they always know where you are after that so it becomes a run and gun sort of situation. The AI for the game is also terrible. There are times where to clear a room i use a classic RPG tactic that shouldn't work in this type of game but it does. You know when you are playing your typical RPG game and you see an enemy but to engage in combat you have to touch them and the only way to get a suprise attack is to sneak up on them. Well in those types of games you try to sneak up and if the enemy notices you can walk out of their territory/vision radious and they will go back to their position. Then you sneak up on them and get a surprise attack. Well this same tactic works on this game although there isn't any strategy because you don't have to touch the enemies back to hit them. Walk in the room and let the enemy see you then run out of their radious and they turn around to go back. You simply step out and get your critical hit in the head and they die. There were some times where i would run out of the enemies radious and they would run to a certain point and then just stand there looking at me 5 feet away lol. Then there are some levels where you can sneak all the way through it just to have a heads up firefight with a boss. Let me repeat that. Sneak all the way through for it to be a heads up firefight with the boss. Whats the point? If thats the case why not run and gun on certain levels if it ends the same way. There is no point in reading up on the profiles of enemies because it doesn't increase your chances of winning anymore. There isn't much to the game other than playing through it. All the side items don't matter with all the flaws in the game you could win with the primary pistol doing the tactic stated above. Too many flaws for me and simple tactics exploit the AI and glitches in this game. Its not completely terrible but there are far to many good games out there to play mediocre ones like this. To me there isn't an excuse for the problems i faced while playing it. I think the concept was cool but for the most part the project was rushed.

1.0,True,"11 15, 2010",A1CE9259TTIIEA,B003O6EFKI,Monsieur Mouton,"I have played a handful of MMORPGS, largely FFXI and WOW, but a few others as well. My preference for online games are those lush in aesthetic detail, with involved combat, and which are readily accessible to both casual and hardcore gamers. I had long felt FFXI was sorely lacking on the last of those two marks, but had a great deal of both scenic and narrative detail. My hopes that XIV would remedy the ills of XI and improve upon its better qualities never materialized in the finished product. XIV is a shallow game, glutted with repetition, a cumbersome user interface, and a combat and crafting system both tedious and ungratifying.

XIV's world, Eorzea, is massive even to other Final Fantasy entries. Unfortunately, one quickly finds that the terrain is almost ceaselessly unvarying. The starter regions are, befitting to Final Fantasy's emphasis on graphical beauty, impressive. But one look is all one needs to have seen the full extent of any of these areas, or any of those a player will later come upon. There are no areas that break up the unremitting terrain, like WoW's forests, lakes, camps, villages, etcetera, and no alteration to the single loop of music as you travel. Monsters too, though they change in name and level, rarely change in models. More disappointing are the starter city's, especially Limsa Lominsa, which looks blocky and unfinished. Ul'Dah is a drab city built like a race course, moving in circles through corridors of recurrent grays and browns. Despite being more functional and easier to travel than XI's starter cities, they lack any memorable character or life, especially when compared to more contemporary MMORPGs. The setting is only complimented by an interesting storyline, a rarity amongst most online games.

Gameplay is FFXIV's most pivotal failure. Leveling a class, which is determined by the weapon you have equipped, is done purely by grinding mobs or performing a limited set of quests. These quests are truly the only viable way to progress, but an individual is restricted to how many they may take in a real 24 hour period. Even when these quests, the so-called `guild leves,' are meant to be difficult and attempted only with a group, they end quickly and require little skill. They are also exceedingly unoriginal, requiring killing x amount of mobs or collecting x amount of items. You've seen the full gambit of quests by the time you're in your teen levels, but are forced to repeat them if you've any intention of leveling further. Crafting, which is markedly improved from XI, is also needlessly complex, risky, and boring. Progressing as a craftsman will entail a great many failures. Your skill level has a bearing on your chance of success, but a prevailing capriciousness within the system seems to work against you more than not. Buying and selling goods crafted or not, is truly cumbersome. There is no auction house, nor a way to search for items.

If you don't, the game is not nearly as much fun as previous iterations.

The biggest problem is that Just Dance 2016 shows you all the songs without an easy way to identify what you can and can't play without making additional purchases.  That means on the home screen it looks like you can play dozens of songs, but when you click on one to actually play, the game asks you to subscribe for access.  This was tremendously frustrating to my tween, who is a huge Just Dance fan, because most things she wanted to do the game wouldn't let her without more money.  Personally I think its ridiculous to charge $60 for a game and then gimp access by trying to nickel-and-dime (and twenty) the people who bought it.  But if Ubi is going to do it that way, at least give the option to only show the game we can actually play.

When I heard Spyro was gonna be on next gen systems I was excited! Boy...I did not espect them to butcher the series for me. For one this game was not made by Insomniac games who are responsible for making the first 3 kickass games. That was my first sign this probably wasn't gonna be as good as I want it to be. (May contain spoilers)

Story: This entire story is a plot hole. In the 2nd Spyro Ripto was the main villian and you kill him at the end. This game gives no explanation on how the hell he returns. I understand the Dragonfly plot, but Riptos return is just crazy.

Graphics: Even though the graphics looked pretty good, I found lots of graphical glitches. For one the game lags alot. Before trading my copy I had a glitch where the all the sheep in the game front leg stretched into the sky. I restarted my console, but the glitch remained. It wouldn't go away. I also noticed the character designs seemed a little distorted at time. In the honey world theres a graphical glitch where all the honey stops flowing too. Damn! Did they have any quality assurance?

Gameplay: The gameplay works the same as the first 3 games, but new firebreathing techniques are added. I found lots of trouble wuth the bubble breath. I would be chasing a dragonfly and I will clearly be hitting it with the bubblebreath, but he won't be caught. That is a huge pain in the ass later on when you have to chase them annoying things on platforms and are faster. Once again theres lag. Lagging is a huge issue in this game because it happens often and slow gameplay. theres also this funny ass glitch where you swim un the air. In the homeworld just swim to the edge of the water at the Beach world entrance. Do a headslam and hold square when you do it and start swimming in the air like its water. You can go all over the place with it. This prooves they didn't test the game before releasing it. I also had trouble figuring out what to do after fighting Ripto. I got no ending or nothing, so I tried collecting everything. It was impossible. I needed one gem and it was in the Thieves den. I spent days looking for it even using Sparks to help, but it never showed up. In the dragon dojo there was a glitch that happens when you try to get the kites for the baby dragons. IIf you jump in the right spot around the kite trees, the game will make the mistake of thinking you touched the kite and give it to the baby. Removing any strategy involved with getting it the normal way.

Sound: One of the highlights of Spyro games was always the sound and music. The music wasn't too bad. Its definately not the usual Spyro formula, but it wasn't too bad. I notived alot of the music consisted of what sounds to me like Indian chants. My favorite tracks were in the Thieves Den level. The music is kind of boring though. Its lacks the intensity and fun of the older games. Sadly even the sound has glitches. sometimes the music and sounds skip. In the Dragon Dojo the sound of the enemies attacking skipped the entire time I was in the level and wouldn't go away until I left.

Lengh: This game is short. I MEAN short. Its only one world! I mean WTF! Spyro the dragon had 5 worlds including a bonus, Riptos Rage had 3 including an bonus, and Year of the dragon had 4 including many extras. This has one world with 7 or 8 short levels! From my knowledge theres not even a bonus for getting all coins and dragonflies. You don't get all your money from Moneybags the bear, theres no extra powers, nosatisfying cutscene, or any reason to try and complete the levels 100%. As mention earlier nothing happened when I defeated Ripto so I know this because of a LP I saw on Youtube.

 In short Spyro Enter the Dragonfly was a huge disappointment. This game could have been good if put in the right hands.

See my review for the original Genesis version if you are curious about the REAL thing. This port....is awful. Utterly awful..

How did Sega mess this up? They could have just simply ported the Genesis game onto the GBA, and call it a day. But nope. They had to ""update"" it to the horribleness that is at Sonic 2006 standards.

So why is this game so bad on the Game Boy Advance? Well, first off, the camera is a bit more zoomed in than in the original. That way, you'll never know if an enemy or some other projectile would fly at you from above. The control is actually WORSE than the original! There would actually be QUITE a bit of lag! It doesn't take long to get Sonic to run, but you don't get that speedy feel. And when you jump, you actually move a bit clunkier! Not to mention the game's choppy framerate.

And then there are glitches. Come on? Really? Why did Sonic slip backwards into a space where he'd be crushed? Why did I go through Robotnik's wrecking ball? But those are only a few of some pretty fatal glitches you'd find whenever you play.

The music for Sonic the Hedgehog is some of the best tunes you'd ever hear from the Sega Genesis. The Game Boy Advance is CLEARLY capable of it. Actually, it's capable of anything from the 8-Bit consoles to Super NES and Genesis. But the music happens to be poorly done on this port. It's like as if a sound chip from the NES was borrowed, with a measly 2 notes from the Genesis sound chip...By the way, the sound effects were wonky, too.

The so-called Anniversary Mode sucks. It's only the inclusion of the Spin-Dash move from Sonic 2.

The only good thing about this trashy port is that you can save. Games like Sonic could possibly be unforgiving without any save feature. Only experienced gamers could beat it under one sitting. Now, anyone could step into the action (Somewhat...) and still continue progressing.

Overall, it's easy to see that this game would've be seen as the end of the Sonic franchise, along with Sonic 2006. Actually, even if Sega just directly ported the original Sega Genesis game without any changes, it would still be something to overlook, considering the fact that that version has been released on so many game collections (Sonic Jam, Mega Collection, Ultimate Genesis Collection, Sega Genesis Collection, to name A FEW).",How???,1329609600,6,,

1) Bad fit. The device fits on the 360 very poorly.  It BARELY squeezes in on the back, and when you snug it on there, you'll find that your wireless network adapter hardly fits in place any more.  Mine kept coming unplugged as a result and losing my connection with Live.

2) Noise.  This sucker is LOUD!!!  I have a ton of cooling fans on my PC, and this thing is much louder.  In any intense moments in horror games, I find my concentration straying from the sound design of the game and instead focusing on the fan humming along.  Once it gets a little loose, you then start to hear it rattle and hum.

3) Vibrations.  As I just mentioned, it vibrates like mad.  You can hear it rattling around back there when it turns on, and this can't be good for your 360.

4) Power drain.  As some other reviews have noted, since the power to the whole system is routed through here, you're bound to lose some power to your system.  This could have disastrous effects in the long run.

5) Cheap clips.  The clips that help it clasp onto the back of the 360 are very cheap, and are very likely to break.  Mine have survived, but my homeboy's broke, and the thing doesn't work at all anymore.

Does the 360 overheat?  You betcha.  Mine sits in an enclosed entertainment center, and I've had it overheat when I shut the door to the 360 by accident.  It completely shut down and the happy green power light turned into an angry blinking red.  And yes, that was with the intercooler on.  The point is, with all the negatives of the cooler, it doesn't even help to keep your 360 cool when you need it to!

The same efforts were put forth with Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate, and although on some level it succeeds in that, the game as a whole falls short. The map structure is confusing, the mission objectives bounces all over the place, and the story is an utter bore.

Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate is a sequel to Batman: Arkham Origins (which itself is a prequel) set a couple months afterwards. You start out chasing after Catwoman from rooftop to rooftop and once you catch up to her, the police come, and Batman dips out just in time for them to catch her. The story then picks up two weeks later at Blackgate Prison, where it seems a riot has taken place and the inmates are now free to do as they please, very much like how it was done in the first game, Arkham Asylum. The story from there is thin and easily forgettable with recycled villains and constant backtracking. And thanks to the erratic missions structure, keeping focused on it is a chore in itself.

Blackgate is separated into three main areas all of which are under the control of a different Batman nemesis. They are the Joker, the Penguin, and Black Mask. All of which of course build a small army of enemy fodder for the Caped Crusader to pummel his way through. As the Dark Knight fights his way through Blackgate, he finds everything he needs with the help of Catwoman because apparently this great detective, with all his cool futuristic gadgets, needs her to tell him where everything is and what everyone is doing. This is more than likely due to the map being nothing more than a hinderance, and the inconsistent mission structure.

You can choose which of the three major sections you would like to start in, but that choice seems useless, as you will be jumping every which way over the three due to the objectives in no time, causing tons of backtracking. It is not bad to force players to backtrack, but it has to be done in a fluid way. Blackgate will have you enter a new area and after a few steps inside, the game will stop you and tell you that you can not go any further until you go back to a place you were already at and get something there to continue on. So you will take three steps back almost every time you want to take two steps forward. This makes the game feel much more repetitive and grind-y than it needs to be. On top of that, the map at times will makes you think you need to go one way and you end up going in the opposite direction. It makes checking the map constantly a must, and causes a big headache along the way.

Blackgate presents everything the same as the major console titles, it just does it in a 2.5D viewpoint instead of third person. Even with this change, the combat still holds up decently, seeing it is the same attacking and countering as its console counterparts. However, Blackgate does suffer some with the combat being that it is a side-scroller and the fighting quite often takes place on two planes, the foreground and background. You do not have the choice on which of these you are going fight on as Batman just starts beating on whichever baddie is closest to him. This is fine when starting out since you're fighting every opponent with hand-to-hand combat. But it becomes more difficult when groups of enemies have a variety of weapons and abilities. You can easily find yourself stunning one enemy and then attacking a different one on another plane completely by accident on numerous occasions, leading to absolute frustration

Outside of the normal bad guys, and of course the three main villains, there is also some mid-boss fights in the game such as Bronze Tiger and Solomon Grundy. These encounters stick to a pretty regular pattern of attacks. You have to defend yourself and then attack, and mix between that and, once in awhile, stun them with your cape so that you can attack them afterward. The big three boss fights are more puzzle-oriented however. These fights can have strict conditions that are needed to be met in order to be successful and will result in serious repercussions if you fail. They take some trial and error, which would be fine if it wasn't for the almost instant deaths from one mistake. If that wasn't bad enough you restart a room or two before the boss fight when you continue. You could easily end up taking more time to get back to the boss fight than being in the fight, until you know exactly what you need to do to beat them.

Blackgate is full of hidden passages, dangerous obstacles, and encrypted security panels for Batman to wonder through when hes not crushing the skulls of every prisoner in Blackgate. Of course there is Detective mode, which you turn on and off by tapping the Vitas screen, revealing an X-ray-like representation of your surrounding from the other games. You can also hold your finger on the Vitas screen for a few seconds to open up a small circle on the screen that will stay there and move with your finger, as long as you continue to hold it on the screen. This is useful for finding hidden objects that weren't immediately recognized in detective mode, and its also a pretty neat little addition to the game that can not be done on the major console titles.

Blackgate has everything needed to be just as good as its console counterparts, but along the line it stumbles, and doesnt match up with its console brethren. Maybe it was rushed or not given the time and effort that Batman: Arkham Origins was, and put out as just the handheld counterpart. Blackgate is a great looking game, and the combat is fun for awhile, but the story is thin and mundane, and that is what should have gotten the most attention. Seeing as the gameplay is almost a carbon-copy of the other games, one would think that took the least amount of effort, and so that would have given more time to build a story. Unfortunately that is not what happened here. It also doesnt help forcing players to jump here and there with backtracking for almost every little thing at every turn. It would be nice to see another try at a Batman game on the Vita, as the handheld sure could use more games. I just think that after the Arkham series, which has seen four titles five years, he may indeed be the hero the Vita deserves, but not the one it needs right now.",My Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate Review,1385769600,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It feels incredibly cheap, like I just picked this mouse up from the dollar general in my town. The mouse doesn't come with any batteries, which is insane because even the cheapest wireless mouse usually comes with a set.

I also don't like how Amazon has some sort of system in place where a single product page can have multiple listings. In this case, where there's so many different models, it can become confusing.

The last string of ""Simpson's"" games have been nothing but complete, almost unplayable disasters. It's not saying a whole lot when I hear people are raving that ""Road Rage is THE best Simpson's game!"" Yes, it is the most competent ""Simpson's"" game undoubtedly but still somehow manages to a sad, highly unoriginal bore.

""Hello. Am I speaking to the legal department of Electronic Arts? Yes, this is the legal team at Sega America and we are just calling to let you know that we are suing you breaking copyright."" How that call never happened is beyond me. ""Road Rage"" rips EVERYTHING from the stellar Sega hit ""Crazy Taxi"" except the fun! Considering Sega's title is way over a year old so it's very peculiar that ""Road Rage"" in no way, shape or form decides to build on the ""taxi"" formula and make it into something of it's own. Yes, ""Road Rage"" has arguably better graphics (considering the hardware leap from Dreamcast to XBOX, it's nothing to write home about), many more vehicles and arenas, faster gameplay and the occasional hilarity of ""The Simpson's"" license but the gameplay surprisingly is nowhere as fun, challenging or deep as Sega's ""Crazy Taxi.""

There are 4 gameplay modes: Road Rage, Sunday Drive, Mission Mode and Head to Head. The premise of ""Road Rage"" is simple. You choose one of various Simpson's characters, drive around picking up various Simpson's characters and drop them off as quickly as possible while listening to audio excerpts of the characters dialog repeat. Depending on how quickly you delivered your passenger the higher the pay you receive. Sounds mighty familiar hey? This cycle is fun for about an hour then torturous soon after. ""Road Rage's"" in game clock is incredibly inconsistant and will sometimes give you less then 5 seconds to get your passenger to their destination a few blocks away when you still have a fair amount of time left of total game time or it'll give you 40 seconds to drive one block; it flat out kills the fun. Sunday Drive is exactly what the title implies; driving around town with no time limit or objectives exploring the arena's whatnots. Mission Mode is a pathetic, abundantly unfun exercise in running various objects over within a set amount of time. Head to Head is the only reason to play this game. The 2-player madness can be very entertaining but Head to Head has lame restrictions and doesn't flow as seemlessly (I mean this very loosely) as the 1-Player experience.

Cars or characters - which ever you want to call them - handle one of three ways. There are the fast cars are extremely touchy (Apu's Sports Car), balanced cars that have a satisfactory top speed and handle adequately but sound like they are stuck in second gear (Marge's 4x4 Canonaro) and the slow, borderline useless clunkers (Auto's School Bus). Most people will find themselves sticking to the unforgiving, speed orientated cars because once mastered (which doesn't take a whole lot of time) domination is inevitable.

The arenas range from o.k. to barely playable. ""Evergreen Terrace"" and the ""Entertainment District"" are the most balanced levels and the majority of gamers will find themselves playing those two most often. While their premise is novel arenas like ""The Springfield Dam"" and ""Springfield Mountains"" are too difficult to navigate due to their immensity and poor level design. ""Downtown"" suffers from sporadic slowdown and frame-rate dives that create a slightly nauseating experience. Roads in these are too narrow and hitting the side of the course can bring your cars to a complete stop. Not to mention Mr. Burns and his entirely spastic ""atomic buses"" blocking the road entirely and pushing your car into walls will leave an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.

Graphically ""Road Rage"" in really nothing to get excited over. The colorful, Simpson'esque atmosphere is suiting but visuals aren't as crisp as one should expect from the XBOX. There is a minor texture blur that reminds me a great deal - to a lesser degree - of the graphical style of the N64 title ""South Park.""

I am really happy the voice actors from the TV series recorded some new material for the game. I am really annoyed that they recorded so little. Phrases are very funny the first 10 or so times, but by the time the second or third game loads up using the same character you will have had it. Lisa, one of my favorite character on the show has very few things to say and soon becomes unmistakably irritating. Same can be said for the almost the entire cast of characters.

Lastly I have to touch on how unacceptably glitchy ""Road Rage"" is. I've had cars get stuck on walls, in the middle of the road and occasionally get stuck onto another car. Sometimes I had to quit the game because my car was wedged indefinitely. The collision detection needs a great deal of work. I can't tell you the last time I played a game where if you got enough air time you could fly through background scenery into gray, video game limbo and float there until your time eventually expires. Also the load times, which are nowhere near as horrible as the PS2 version's, are still noticeably bad. Consider how low tech this game appears and how powerful the XBOX is, the time spent at the ""Now Loading..."" screen is utterly unsatisfactory. ""Road Rage"" has ""rushed"" plastered all over it.

Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this uninspired rip-off. I heard Sega will eventually port ""Crazy Taxi 2"" to the XBOX. I recommend investing in the originator, not settling for a half-baked designer imposter.",Doh,1007769600,,,

Ok, this game is one of the most boring PC games I've ever played; it's loosely considered a PC game by my definition. Far Cry 2 was a big let down, with no surprise it actually ending up being a console port, with PC at the very back of the minds of the developers. The story is absolutely boring, as well as the characters, which I don't even remember, were ALL forgettable. I honestly cannot even remember what the game was about - it was really one of those video games you just had to finish so you can tell someone else ""Oh yeah, I beat that game before"". Consolised gameplay comes second to worse, as well as the annoying re spawning of enemies. Gun mechanics were laughable.

Something about the graphics in FC2 really ticked me off, crappy textures, visuals - reminds me of a console (oh that's right, this is a port). Another annoying thing is how gigantic the world in FC2 is, that maybe good for other ""good"" games, but not FC2; you spend more time driving to your destination than you actually do finishing missions.

Overall, there was nothing memorable about this game -- I would avoid at all cost if you love the original game as well as PC games. You aren't missing anything.

For the record: because I wanted to like this game so much I gave it two complete play-throughs with different character types, different play-styles, and on different difficulties. Yes, it was difficult to play so much of a game that I eventually ended-up despising, but I had such high hopes for this series (mostly because of Dragon Age: Origins and my history with BioWare) that I had to be sure I was giving the game a fair shake.

If you liked Dragon Age: Origins -- stay away from this game; it has none of the attention to detail, none of the sense of grandeur, and certainly much less of a heart than it's predecessor. (Well, the graphics are ""better"" in DA2, but Origins managed to keep my interest regardless of its slightly-less-than-amazing graphics; the ""more polished"" look of DA2 was not enough to keep my interest.)

If you liked Mass Effect 2: stick to that series of games; DA2 is not a ""fantasy"" version of Mass Effect 2, and is merely borrowing some mechanics and awkwardly thrusting them into what was already a successful (and vastly different) series.

If you're a BioWare fan because of Baldur's Gate and related games (like me), then there is little for you to love in Dragon Age 2.

If you want to know why this game is so terrible (in a mechanical way, and not speaking about the fact that it's a half-hearted, rushed, big-corporate-production aimed at cashing-in on the success of it's predecessor) then read some of the other reviews here on Amazon, click over to MetaCritic and read the USER reviews, and visit the official BioWare forums.

BioWare fans: you have been wronged, and the world of video games has another artless plastic box taking-up shelf space all over the world.

The game world has several examples of what happens when developers do a rushed, half-hearted job because of responses to ""marketing analysis"" and pressure from the publisher; ""Ultima 9"" and ""Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within"" were always my two favorite examples, but Dragon Age 2 is getting added to that list.",I'm tired of writing about how disappointed I am...,1318118400,8,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'}",

1.0,False,"05 20, 2012",AFLRU6952DEFX,B00178630A,S.,"I've sat through an hour and a half of Diablo III, and honestly, it was boring.

Maybe I'm a bit cynical, but I kind of saw all of this coming, from the first point hearing about the healing orbs (aka power ups) to the DRM fiasco.  Most if not all the original makers of the Diablo franchise left Blizzard years ago for other companies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torchlight/dp/B001B5U80K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torchlight</a>/ Torchlight 2), leaving a crew that's basically made WoW.  Unfortunately for them, that ship, WoW, has pretty much run its course.  With regards to D3, the criticism is not really a case of ""this isn't Diablo [II] enough"" but rather, this is all the bad sides of D2, with none of the good aspects (namely character customization and sort of a sandboxey go-where you like when you like feeling.  D3 100% linear guided tour, no choices, game on rails.).

Take D2.  You had to grind through 2 difficulties before you got to the ""real"" difficulty level where all the good stuff dropped and the tough battles ensued.  Doing those quests for a the millionth time really sucked but hey, that's what you had to do.  And you decided which quests you wanted to do, and sometimes in what order, and could go pretty much wherever you wanted whenever you wanted as long as you killed the act bosses.  Only this time, in D3, you have to grind through 3 difficulties before you get to the final one.  At least this time they shortened the time it takes, but in a way that's a negative as well just because there is hardly 60 bucks worth of content.  In D2 the loot made things interesting, but in D3 the loot is super randomized and always improving but doesn't feel special.

Think about it... would you rather play 60 hours of content on one difficulty level, or play 15 hours of content, four times repeated?  The second option sounds boring, and maybe in my misspent youth I would have gone for it, but now I think gamers know better.  Skyrim is looking like A LOT better value right now and at least is a real role-playing game. A roleplaying game is one where you take a risk, you invest in certain skills and skip others, and your character is a unique creation; you might have picked a good combo, or maybe not, but it was still your choice, your experiment.  In Diablo III, it's a socialist dystopia where everyone is perfectly equal and perfectly the same and perfectly boring.  If you want a character progression and choice over your path, don't just walk, run away from this title.

Diablo III is a game inspired by RPGs, even the interface and town interiors look ripped from Baldur's Gate.  But the game itself really has more in common with Contra or Metal Slug, 2d shooter style games where you run around, shoot the baddies, get the power-up, etc etc.  The rune system later in the game makes this a little more complex, but is sorta like Contra where you earned different ways of shooting - everyone has access to the exact same runes (skill tweaks) at any time, and you can change them at the drop of a hat.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Diablo III looks like a mishmash of Warcraft III, World of Warcraft, and Diablo.  It can't quite decide whether it wants to be scary or cute and colorful, so it does both. The monsters and scorched ground areas look ripped from the undead campaigns in Warcraft III.  Honestly, if someone had told me this was some sort of super mod for that game, I might have believed them, as the game looks more like I'd expect a Warcraft game than Diablo.  The Grotesque monsters, for example, are supposed to be nasty things that scratch and claw and then blow themselves up into a bloody mess.  But instead they look like Kirby from the Nintendo games or mini versions of the Stay Puffed Marshmellow Man from Ghostbusters.  Seriously, the monsters are for the most part just WoWish and don't look like they belong in a traditional fantasy universe (like Dungeons and Dragons).

In the end, I can't believe it took them so long to develop what is essentially maybe 15-20 hours of content, strung along through repeated difficulties.  I'm sure someone will play this for hundreds of hours trying to get a marginally different styled armor for their cookie cutter character (since now there are really only as many character builds as there are character types).

You can take Blizzard's side and say that ""streamlining"" the game was good, but in reality, every character is exactly the same looking and acting, minus whatever differences in gear happen.  All female wizards for example look EXACTLY alike and have no customization of skills, appearance, face, hair, etc., etc, and if you've seen one, you've seen them all.  This was acceptable in 2000, not in 2005 and certainly not now.  Neverwinter Nights, Guild Wars, and Elder Scrolls games all always offered more depth of who your character was. No replayability.

I guess we can face it that this is an action game with customizable armor, but where apparently the physical damage of a held weapon determines your ability to shoot fire and lighting from your palms.  I'm sure someone will say that makes choosing a weapon easier, but it just makes the game make no sense, unless you look at it from the perspective of the developers not having the time or creativity to actually develop a convincing attack bonus system for casters.

In a way, the makers are lucky that people are locked out of the game.  Everyone wanted more from D3 than they remembered from D2, and I think most people got much less than they were hoping for.  Bad voice acting, bad storyline, and neat but ultimately forgettable cinematics (probably the cause of all the delay -- Blizzard having to pay for and film the equivalent of a movie within a game).  A game that can't really decide if it's a single player game or an MMO, so it tries to do both and doesn't truly suceed.  This is MMO-light, probably for people who sadly don't have the experience to know what this game is missing.

If this wasn't rentware, I'd give it 2 stars for at least having town interiors that reminded me of classic Bioware games. I haven't said much about the DRM and heavy server lag because everyone already knows the game is going to be somewhat crippled for a little while longer until either more people quit or Blizzard improves capacity.  I think it will be a fun game a year or two from now when it is patched and everything is rethought and the price is cut.  It is simply unplayable (lag, disconnects, 40 minutes of lost progress) at random times, and that's why my review is 1 star instead of 2 stars.

Until then, save your money, and buy something else.  D3 just isn't in the same league as the other games mentioned, and it just isn't worth paying that much for a temporary game that will be unplayable the day Blizzard decides to pull the plug on their servers, which could be tomorrow or could be 10 years from now (the mighty can fall - just look at the banks and GM).

In the end, you aren't paying for a game, you're paying for a subscription to their (laggy) servers, a MMORPG without the RPG and without the MM.

You start out in a small town, its being attacked by some evil family. So some chick turns you all to stone so you will not die, then she attacks this guy. All of a sudden your back in the huge building, and some guy says go on a quest. So you leave for no reason and have no info as to who you are, except you are part of the dragon clan. You go to the first town and you kill some dude in a castle. Now the king tells you ""You are awesome!"", and tells you to go to some town and find the quake control to stop the earthquakes. Not only was this task stupid, I do not even know why I did it, because I got no reward. Also, couldn't the king have sent his men to clear out the castle? So you go to the town at night and sneak in past the guards. Keep in mind you have not said one thing at all during the game. You kill a knight and turn off the quake control. Now you go back to the king and he says ""You rock again! I am too lazy to give you anything so your a hero, now leave!"". Then you go to some town and you learn the king is ill. So you play as Nina to go to some other place and get a remedy from a wizard. How did they know the wizard had a remedy? Then you get sent to help Nina kill him. Back at the castle, the king gets up and Nina says ""I am going with Ryu because I need to stop evil in the world"". So then you leave. Notice you have done 3 quests and got nothing but Nina.
Not only do you have no info about who you are, you are given weird tasks that give you nothing in the end. I am still not sure anyone knows my name. This game is overrated.

I have a GTX 970 , Intel Core i7 and 16 GB of RAM. I doubt this game uses even a third of the video memory I have. I've seen last gen games that look better than this. Second is the false perception this game was DRM Free. Don't assume it's going back to the old way of simply install and play. It's installed just like any game licensed to Steam , instead you get GOG Galaxy , a poorly pieced game launcher in beta stage. You install the game from four discs and enter the code which links it to your account. Did they just say you have access to your game wherever you go ? They forgot to say you need internet to install it the first time , an just like any PC game it's non refundable whether it runs  on your PC or not. It's yours forever after you run it. Their system is no different than Steam . Except it's worse in many ways. Downloads constantly fail , and restart . The game crashes every hour or so , which i emailed the developers about but they haven't responded as of four days. Once you've bought the game , CD Project Red doesn't care whether you can play it or not because once you launch the game you're stuck with it for life.

Update 7-30-15 :

Actually, I've never really had a keyboard fail at typing before, period...in fact, I'm currently typing this edit to this review on an old dell keyboard from 2001...lol.

Original Review:

A solid mechanical keyboard. Keys are plastic, but it's nice to have the aluminum base. Makes it feel a little classier.

Doesn't use any software. All the programming is done via the keys on the board itself. I think that confuses people, as it's unusual to not use software for that type of thing, but it's important to point out, so people don't think there's something wrong with the board.

I don't really care about programming the lighting. I don't look at my keyboard while gaming, so lighting up specific keys seems pointless, but it doesn't hurt, I suppose.

It comes with additional ""game-friendly"" keycaps for WASD and 1-6. I only use the ""W"" one. ""A"" and ""D"" especially, due to their contouring, are horrible for actual typing, and who's got the time to be switching back and forth. Even the ""W"" one does little, probably, but it also doesn't interfere with my typing, so I use it. Plus, it looks great:) That said, I would LOVE to see all the keys have the same texture as those extra contoured keycaps had. That, to me, is the best thing about them, and an entire keyboard with textured keys would be AMAZING.

If you don't know how to take the caps off, you use the tool that comes with the board. They're like tweezers. Insert, pull straight up. There will be a little resistance, which can scare you if you aren't sure you're doing it right, but you are. Doing it right.

One minor odd thing I found with my keys are that some of them bleed a little bit of light out through streaks on their sides (usually the side facing me). Not all. Just some. Like they hadn't been painted completely black. Again, very minor.

Overall, purchased it here for $119.99. Slightly more expensive than the ballpark for non-RBG ""gaming"" mechanical keyboards (though I also choose the brown switches, the other switches are cheaper and smack dab in the same pricing as its competitors). The aluminum base was worth it, as well as not having to deal with extra gimmicky ""macro"" buttons.

Compared to Corsair's Strafe (non-RGB model), I'd choose the K70, due to multiple different switches, aluminum base (Strafe is all plastic), and dedicated media buttons. The only direct comparison would be if you use red switches, and there's only a $10 difference there, which I think the build quality of the K70 is worth.",Terrible reliability.

1.0,True,"01 22, 2014",AD8M3PE8J2G86,B005QWYKOE,S D,"The worst Nintendo console I've ever owned and I immediately sold it after a few months before anyone else found out what I found out about it and before it got any cheaper than it already was. The worst thing was that I got a KU version of the Wii which wasn't backwards compatible with Nintendo GameCube games, controllers, or memory cards. I was so looking forward to it, judging by all the hype and positive things I heard, all the lies, I thought that I was going to finally enjoy a great gaming experience with fluent motion controls, but I was dead wrong. The Nintendo Wii is an underpowered, inferior console with graphics on par with it's predecessor the Nintendo GameCube. Even with the component cable bringing it up to 480P it still looked like a generation before its time. This thing couldn't even compete with the PS2 or Xbox let alone the PS3 and Xbox 360. When it came to graphics, gameplay, or anything else, the Wii was way behind.

The gimmicky, HORRIBLE, ATROCIOUS, controls of the Wii Mote and Nunchuk are so awful that they've ruined games which had so much potential to become classic Nintendo titles. The thing that bothers me the most about the Wii is the few options available for controls. You HAVE to use the Wii Mote and Nunchuk for most games. The Classic Controller isn't utilized for any of its ""good"" games and is mostly used with the virtual console games, not that the Classic Controller didn't suck as well because it did and the GameCube controller was far superior and felt far more comfortable in my hands. The Wii classic controller is really small, has awkward placement of its buttons, is extremely light and feels like it was made from very cheap plastic with no rumble feature, the trigger buttons are awkward, the joysticks are weak and can easily break, and the DPad is stiff and gets stuck during gameplay. The Wii Classic Controller is complete garbage compared to the amazing Nintendo GameCube controller that came out years and years before it.

If you have played The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess on the GameCube, than do not buy a Nintendo Wii and play the Wii version of that game. The Wii controls for Twilight Princess absolutely destroyed a somewhat decent Zelda title. In the Wii version of Twilight Princess you have to keep a floating fairy that corresponds to the position of the Wii Mote with the TV and Sensor Bar, dead center in the middle of the screen or else Link will walk off in another direction and you'll constantly fall off annoying ledges and it will slow you down and reduce the quality of your game play significantly. It'll also make your wrist tired from having to keep it constantly aimed at the center of the screen. I AM APPALLED BY THE AUDACITY, OF THOSE ADVERTISERS ON GAME TRAILERS AND IGN, WHO LIED OUT OF THEIR TEETH ABOUT THE NINTENDO Wii. They made the Wii appear to be something that it was the complete opposite of. They advertised Twilight Princess and made statements about how wonderful the Wii Mote controls are and how good it feels to swing a sword around. LIES! You don't swing a sword around in Twilight Princess, you flick your wrist around and Link moves the sword in correspondence to a predetermined set of directions. The sword doesn't move in the direction you aim it in, it goes in the directions the game aims it in, which is the same exact predetermined set of directions. Using the shield is also annoying because you have to punch with the Nunchuk and it doesn't always work unlike the GameCube version where you press the R button to hit with the shield. Fishing becomes much more needlessly challenging and horseback riding is much worse all because of the Wii Mote and Nunchuk controls. Fishing doesn't feel like fishing at all, despite the lies of the advertisers on IGN and Game Trailers. All you're doing is reeling in the lure by rotating the Nunchuk in a circular motion with the annoying cord of the Nunchuk, I preferred the control stick and A button from the GameCube version. Horse back riding was also destroyed by the Wii Mote and Nunchuk since you have to keep the on screen fairy dead center in the middle of the screen or else the horse will move in another direction slowing you down and running you into obstacles and cliffs. Same thing when controlling the wolf.

Super Smash Bros. Brawl is another major disappointment and without a doubt the worst addition to what was a decent fighting game series. Brawl is awful, especially when compared to the original Smash Bros. for the N64; and when compared to Smash Bros. Melee for the GameCube, Brawl is complete garbage. I recently got Brawl and was playing it on my recently purchased Wii U (which is another garbage console but I'm not here to review the Wii U). I had to pay $20 for a Mayflash Nintendo GameCube to Wii U controller adapter (which is another piece of garbage as well) just to play Brawl with ""decent"" controls because I was playing it with the Wii Mote earlier before this adapter arrived. It's so unbelievably boring and I completely refuse to play through the subspace emissary, all you do is side scroll fighting weird creepy enemies that look like dolls stitched together from old throw pillows (Primid). The adventure mode in melee was much better and much cooler. There's new characters in the game that are completely obscure and uninspired. All the problems that existed in Melee are back tenfold in this game like the clone characters (Ganondorf, Captain Falcon, Fox, Falco, Wolf, etc). Melee's Link was much cooler since his design was based on the Ocarina of Time Link, Brawl's Link is based on the very effeminate and wimpy looking Twilight Princess Link. The graphics hurt my eyes and I'm playing on a Plasma Screen 40 inch Samsung with the Wii U HDMI cable. The way Brawl plays just feels sluggish and slow. It feels like the frame rate has been downgraded immensely and slowed down from Melee. There's no fun factor in Brawl, I've technically only played it for 1 day and I'm ready to sell my Wii U and everything that came with it. I thought for sure this would be the one decent playable Wii game, but it's just as bad as all the others and I won't sit through this abomination. Brawl is virtually unplayable, especially if you've experienced Melee or the original Smash Bros.; Brawl is a disgrace to the series.

I was lied to about the Nintendo Wii and no one told me how terrible it really was, otherwise I would have never bought it. All the so called ""good"" games on the Wii turned out to be complete failures because of the awful Wii Mote and Nunchuk controls. When playing New Super Mario Bros. and Metroid Other M, the control is even worse than in other Wii games. You don't use the Wii Mote and Nunchuk, you use the Wii Mote flipped on it's side. It's like playing with a remote controller, a thin remote control, using no joystick just a dpad. It isn't fun and it's a major step backwards from the GameCube controls. Had they given us the option to use a regular controller like any other video game console uses, those games could have been classics like the Wii version of Twilight Princess, Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Skyward Sword, Metroid other M, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, New Super Mario Bros., etc. Instead, these games are virtually unplayable and will go down in history as Nintendo's biggest disappointments to their true fan base.

Using the internet browser in the Wii was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. It uses the crappy Opera internet browser and weak Flash Player Light. It was slow, sluggish, and lagged immensely even with a fast internet connection. The YouTube App is the worst version of a YouTube app I've ever seen on any electronic device. When searching for a video, it automatically spells the words for you and more often than not, it's a word you didn't intend to search for. It doesn't show the correct search results anyway; even when you can manage to type in the words using the awful controls of the Wii remote. When typing in the words, you have to aim the Wii Mote at each character, you can't use the Wii classic controller or plug in a keyboard, you can't use the DPad from the Wii Mote or the control stick from the Nunchuk to select the characters. When aiming at the characters the Wii Mote vibrates with each character the pointer runs over. More often than not, you'll accidentally select a character that you didn't want because it's so hard to get the pointer to focus on one single character and you won't be able to simply backspace that single character to make a correction. Selecting backspace deletes the entire word and you have to type it all over again all because of a simple mistake. The search results are never correct, it never returns accurate search results and you can never see official music videos. I think there was some kind of copyright issue where Vevo won't allow their videos to be seen on the Wii. The same thing happens with the P.S Vita (another garbage system) and its YouTube app and internet browser.

Owning the Wii was the biggest disappointment of my life and all because of the lies and the over-hyping of the entire YouTube community. The entire YouTube community is guilty for making this garbage system seem like anything other than a glorified Nintendo GameCube with virtually unplayable controls that destroyed games with the potential of being classic Nintendo titles.",This is without a doubt,1390348800,2,,

1.0,False,"11 19, 2009",A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B0017HPE7E,Duckman,"First of all, I'd like to say that I've been a fan of Sonic since Christmas of 1991 and have been a fan of the franchise throughout the 90's.  Sonic Unleashed, like the other Sonic games that have broken into the ""3D"" generation of game consoles, is really unpleasant.

The graphics are pretty nice and the whole thing with Sonic becoming a ""Werehog"" and going around slashing and punching bad guys is pretty fun, but that's all there is to say that's positive about this game.

While it may seem unfair to target this particular Sonic game for this upcoming flaw, but I feel it's legit.  The biggest problem with this game is the 3D environment.  Sorry, but I truly feel that Sonic wasn't meant for a 3D environment since it's extremely difficult to move really fast while collecting as much rings as possible in this type of environment since it's much easier to die and since it's easy to veer off your desired path, it's much harder to collect rings.  While most video games in the last 8-10 years have done away with the ""limited life"" system so ubiquitous in the first three game console generations, it's still in this game and it gets on your nerves because you're gonna die A LOT.

The tallying system at the end of each level really gets on my nerves because in the ""classic"" Sonic games, the tallying system just tallied your numeric score and if you got a high score, you'd get a continue.  However, the tallying system in Sonic Unleashed is atrocious because the game expects you to accomplish much more difficult levels in a timely manner and has the nerve to actually grade you (using letters A through F) at the end.  Isn't it good enough that I came out alive?  Just give me a numeric score, don't grade me like a strict university professor.

Aside from the 3D layout and harsh tallying system, I was stuck on one level where you're on top of the Tornado (piloted by Tails, of course) and Eggman has launched a giant robot thingy firing guided bombs at you.  I DETEST this level because in order to shoot down the incoming bombs, each projectile is targeted with an icon of either the A, B, X, or Y buttons above them and you have to press the right button in a really short time in order to fire the missiles.  This is horrendous because you're in such a panic, you're just mashing buttons, hoping that you hit the right ones since you don't have any time to think.  Wouldn't it be more convenient if there was just one button to fire missiles or just have a machine gun and point it at the projectiles?  At that point, I quit playing and returned the copy to Family Video.

After playing this and the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog games, it's no surprise to me as to why the newer Sonic games aren't so popular among gamers and critics alike.  Sonic Team should really take their cue from Nintendo concerning the New Super Mario Bros.

So why spend $59.00 and buy a game that won't operate most of the time for thousands of current owners.  I bought BF3 December first for $59.00 and paid $1400.00 for a screaming gamer to run it.  With 3 upgrades at $600.00 to really make this demanding software happy I am now at around $2100.00 in a freaking game.  (AND THAT'S THE GOOD PART). I have only been able to play for 8 days.  That is about two grand a week.  My machine is factory configured is not over clocked and plays Call of Duty and BF3 (when it worked) like it isn't even breathing heavy on ultra settings.

Origin's support is overwhelmed.  After going through the initial layer of polite know-nothings that can only do what is on a printed algorithm in front of them I have been told twice ""you will get an email from a higher level IN THREE TO FIVE BUSINESS DAYS"".  When you don't get the promised email you call the no nothings back and are told we currently don't have a solution but ""THEY ARE WORKING ON IT AS FAST AS THEY CAN"".  I have spent 21 hours of my time on their ""SUPPORT LINE"" or downloading and following their instructions to the letter.  I have been able to play 8 out of  18 days of ownership.  You can make that 23 days because I was told today it would be 5 more business days, due to the high volume of calls they are getting, before I will be contacted by email with the next attempted fix from the higher authority.  The sky is crashing down around EA and Origin and they are punishing former Battlefield
Believers for it.

Now that is only part of the story I also am putting rental money in a server that I can't use because the game now won't authorize me when I attempt to join even though it shows my correct game code on the origin client when I log into my account.  They now want me to change my account , abandon the player name I have since about 2002, forfeit all my unlocks, my stats and sit on my duff until they find a solution???  I don't think so.  THIS CRAP HAS CLASS ACTION SUITE WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

DO NOT BUY INTO THIS OBVIOUS, RUSH TO MARKET, BETA RELEASE AND BETA MULTIPLAYER CLIENT AND SPEND GOOD MONEY JUST TO FRUSTRATE AND PUNISH YOURSELF.  LEARN FROM STUPID ME I HAVE PLAYED EA SHOOTERS FOR NINE YEARS AND IT ALWAYS COMES  BACK TO A GLITZY WIZ-BANG PRODUCT WITH A LOT OF MEDIA HYPE THAT JUST CRASHES IN SO MANY WAYS EVEN THEY CAN'T FIX IT.

Then for some reason they chose to separate the protective plastic into two parts (and not at the halfway point or something, but about 3/5 of the way.)  This means you get it partially down, then have to carefully pry that part out, 100% guaranteeing that dust will get in while you're doing this (law of the universe.  Any delay = dust under protector.)  I've only been installing screen protectors on devices for roughly ten years (I started with PDAs which also had resistive touchscreens) and which apparently isn't long enough because this one managed to confuse me with the backwards design and the split protective plastic on the wrong side.  I've used a lot of screen protectors and modern ones generally are FAR better designed with the protective plastic being the same size as the protector (you don't want it sticking out like this does because it prevents you from keeping it tight against the surface thus allowing more bubbles and dust to get in.)  Call me OCD, but I can't stand it once a speck of dust gets in or when I get those rare few bubbles that no amount of pushing can get out and this one seems to be designed specifically to guarantee this will happen since you have to lift it back up too much to get that other piece out.  As such, my top protector had to be thrown away entirely (unfortunately, the top screen is only protected with a relatively soft plastic, so can scratch too) and the bottom one has several glaringly ugly specks (you don't even have to be OCD for them to bother you) that makes it annoying enough that I WILL have to replace it.

Also, there's only one in the package.  Now, I'll admit it's my mistake failing to notice that it says it only has one and just assuming it's three like all the decent ones in this price range, but at the same time, at this price range there should be three.  If nothing else, there's a very decent chance the user will make a mistake.  I admit it's my mistake for not noticing it wasn't the usual three pack, but it's also their fault for it not BEING a three pack at this price range...

I originally bought a different brand for my 2DS in the past, but I had forgotten what it was (and didn't think I'd have to go through the troubles to dig through my records to find out what it was because from a quick search I thought Hori sounded right since they are such a big brand.)  I've since looked it up and it was iLLumiShield.  They come in a three pack, are cheaper, are very clear, and apply far better.  I'll have to order another as soon as I can't take it anymore, but I've already blown that much on this mistake and I want to at least get some use out of it before I toss it.

I gave this plus one star because if you can somehow apply it perfectly it is pretty good about handling fingerprints.  I subtracted one star because at this price it should be a three pack.  The rest was just due to the all around bad  design.",Bad design abounds...,1417651200,4,,

Not exactly, file this one with Legend of Dragoon as a predictably unoriginal, mediocre RPG. If you're looking for that game that will pick up this slump of good software for the PS2, you'll have to wait even longer.
Now let me clarify this: I have not played Zelda 64 nor do I own a N64. I did not hear about how this was going to be a copycat of Zelda until I finished reading someone else's review a few minutes ago. That said, I still felt like I was playing a rather effortlessly made copy of it. For sheer curiosity, I tried Zelda at a friend's house. Even the grunts Link makes in-battle seems to be stolen from this game.
What is the gameplay like? For ""Zelda-virgins"" such as myself, it was pretty good at first. It was easy to jump into, and hard to put down for the first 5 hours or so. Good, until, after quite some time in the game, nothing really happens in the storyline (a Sony RPG trademark) and after hours upon hours of repetitive gameplay (yet another Sony RPG trademark), it failed to keep me within its grasps.
The graphics, while good, are nothing spectacular. They quickly get tiresome when you're in the same dungeon for 5 hours or more. Every level of the dungeons look the same, so if you have a high tolerance of environments as repetetive as the gameplay, you'll have no trouble there.
And here's another staple, the immense amount of typing errors, the third sign of a Sony RPG. While there isn't much text, it was enough to make me want to send money to Sony to buy a spell checker for the sake of pity.
Georama is almost innovative. It would be if Sim-City hadn't done this general idea first, and if it gave you more freedom. The villagers are very picky as to where their house should be placed. So picky that you'll wonder why Sony even bothered to let you build these villages at all.

This game is a waste of time. It looks great, but just isn't playable.

The AI isn't capable enough to handle combat...at all. Your party members just walk into the enemy, swing, and die. Blocking is very effective...but your AI party members never do it. You spend over half the time in combat stopping to bring up the menu to heal or revive your allies.

I died three times in the second area of the game as well. Dispersed among the levels are absolutely terrible monsters that will can easily kill your party. The treasure chests attack you. And they annihilate you. They're by far the most difficult enemy in an RPG's early game that I've seen. One hit from them takes off most a character's HP, it can hit multiple characters, and can sometimes attack more than once per animation. The game also scales them up in levels to always be vastly stronger than you, and to top it all off, the game explicitly prevents you from running away from them (the run menu is greyed out when they attack you...) This is completely against the general exploration theme of RPG's...you're supposed to find and open treasure chests, not wonder if the chest contains an item or a practically guaranteed Game Over.

The game also froze once when I was playing it. Interestingly enough, it was when I opened a treasure box...the screen flickered, and just stopped.

You can probably tell by the review below that I really liked this keyboard. It felt great to type on and looked pretty nice. However, after just over three years it's now in the garbage because the ""A"" key stopped working entirely and Razer only warranties their keyboards for 1 year. This is a $140 mechanical keyboard. You spend the excess $$$ on these things because they're supposed to not only type well, but outlast a normal keyboard. It felt great and I really enjoyed it for my first few years of using it, but purchase at your own risk. If you don't mind replacing your keyboard every few years at $120-140 a board then this is a great option. However, if you're looking at getting a keyboard that will last then this is probably not a great option.

One thing to note: I have seen that a number of manufactures only warranty their keyboards for between 1-3 years regardless of what types of switches they have (even rubber vs mechanical). It was something that I looked into when looking for a replacement. Kind of a disappointing thing to see considering that not all keyboards are created equally, but it's good to take into account if you're looking at getting one.

Original Review: I've had this keyboard for two years now, so I feel like I can finally write a review about it's durability and lasting appeal. To put it simply, this keyboard is awesome. I'm an MBA student and a gamer, so this guy sees A LOT of use. Here's a list of pros and cons from a person that's put this keyboard through the ringer:

Pros:
* Tactile feel - I learned to type in my teenage years by playing starcraft and chatting while trying to micro manage everything on my screen. This is to say, I have gotten ridiculously good at typing quickly. This keyboard makes it that much easier to do so, and I feel like my hands are a lot less fatigued after typing up a ten page paper. It's just got a really nice satisfying feel to the actuators under the keys.
* The lighting - There aren't many mechanical keyboards out there with backlighting (or weren't when I was looking), so this is a big plus.
* the sound - You'll see the cons of this in the next section, I like it during the day..
* looks - It looks pretty awesome!

Cons:
* The clicks - The feel of pressing down the keys would be lost without this, so I'm torn on it being good and bad. The sheer volume of the keys if you type quickly can be a bit ridiculous. If your computer is in your bedroom and your significant other likes to sleep while you're on the computer then you might want to consider another option.. This could end relationships.
* After two years of pretty vigorous use the ""A"" key has stopped lighting up. It kind of sucks considering that this keyboard cost so much, but overall it doesn't really impact my life too much. I know where the ""A"" key is and typically don't look down while typing.
* The glossy black finish - It attracts dust and fingerprints. However, it's razer, so that's pretty much inevitable with any of their products.

Overall I dropped what would have been a 5 star review down to 4 stars. I really LOVE the keyboard. I use a number of other ones during my workday (I'm in IT) and none compare to it. However, if you are paying $140 for a keyboard than the thing SHOULD continue to function in all capacities for years. Having one key's light go out isn't a deal breaker for me, but it makes me a bit concerned about how much life is left in the rest of the keys. With that said, typing with this keyboard is heavenly and I've never had a problem with its core function - to type. If you don't care about the volume of your typing then this is a great option for you. I showed it to a friend and had him sit down to type out some jibba jabba and he contacted me the next week to tell me that he had bought himself one and is in love with it. This keyboard should definitely be high on your list if you are shopping around for a mechanical keyboard.",Started great... now it's in the trash,1399507200,,{'Style:': ' Ultimate'},

So many bad points for the Single player Campaign.

1. Any game that takes control of the game so that the player can do nothing is so wrong. Worse, turns into a pinball game where you press an unknown sequence of keys on command displayed on the screen. This is not a video game. At one point you have to listen to a long winded speech by one of the villains, then the sequence starts. If you do not press the right key, or fast enough, or too fast, or too often, or not often enough.... You have to listen to the stupid speech all over again.

2. Whomever is the idiot that put in the bow and arrow in this game is an absolute idiot. It goes about 20 feet before dropping to the ground. My toy bow and arrow I had as a kid went farther than that! Idiot !

3. Story is very good. Too bad I quit before finishing it, as I cannot muster the patience to go through yet another one of the fake sequences. This last one, you fight a giant by shooting the face mask he is wearing. Problem, you are using the bow and arrow with a an effective range of ten feet !!!! Then you get attacked by other creatures in absolute darkness.

4. Another scripted conflict. You walk into a building with a sniper rifle, machine guns, grenades etc... You end up fighting with a knife, but the normal commands don't work! You again have to play pinball wizard and press specific keys in sequence. If you get one key wrong, start all over again. Again, this is a pinball game, not a FPS !!!!

5. Open map concept. Very good. I like that. Fallout series did a better job of it though.

6. Other weapons are good, variety and attachments available for some of them. Good enough selection to play in my style of fighting. Taking them away though so many times is stupid.

7. What kind of idiot does some of the things that the player is scripted, forced to do. Like opening a door of a vehicle and NOT stepping back to let the person or persons in the vehicles get out. Allowing villain to knock out player and AGAIN watch the stupid video time.

8. No way I am even going to try Multi-player.

9. Total lack of the save option forces you to relive portions of the game over and over and over until you get one small portion correctly.

A punch here...A shot there, it gets dull fast. The levels are repetitive, and it becomes a real chore to play through the game. The graphics arn't the best and the sound sucks.

1.0,True,"09 25, 2016",A2TPOVW4RFQIIN,B01GOK4F7S,Aly,"I was so looking forward to this game after all I'd heard about the EA team putting an increased focus on presentation and milestones, etc. Let's face it, the presentation of the Stanley Cup on NHL 16 was awful and boring and not worth the payoff of working your way through an 82 game season plus playoffs. However, I ended up selling this game after just two days of trying it out on EA Access. There are no improvements, as far as I can tell. Arena atmospheres are awkward. No goal music plays after anyone scores, just loud horns announcing the goals, brief cheers from the crowd and then before the puck is dropped for the next face off, everyone is back in their seats and the arena is almost completely silent. There's no momentum carried over for the home team at all. The commentary is carbon copied from NHL 16 with only a few brief new statements added, like Doc talking about a team giveaway or a player's first game with his new team. I don't think a handful of new commentary is worth the cost of this game.

My biggest issue with the game was the gameplay itself. It's regressed terribly from NHL 16. No matter how difficult or easy the settings are adjusted, every game is still full of goals and you can fire 50 great shots on goal and not get one in the net, but your opponent will send a shot from a horrendous angle and score every single time. The penalties are also ridiculous. I had the sliders set as low as possible after being called for multiple penalties simultaneously in every single game and was STILL penalized constantly while the other team never saw the box.

In hindsight, I wish I'd waited to read reviews before buying this game but I'm glad I never opened the copy I bought and was able to return it. I won't make the mistake of pre-ordering an EA NHL game ever again.","Don't wast your money, NHL 16 rehashed...but worse",1474761600,10,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",
1.0,False,"01 11, 2012",A4VF4V6A4W0H7,B001CWXAP2,Gargus,"The issue with this game is it's just more of the same thing on the market now. Yes it has a few new trappings and cool ideas thrown in but the core mechanic that makes up 90% of the game is still the same thing as all of the other mmo games. The novelty factor wore off after a couple weeks of playing and I found myself doing dailies, doing the same routine every time I logged in and I quickly fell into a sense of familiarity with this game. That's when it hit me; I was bored before my free 30 day subscription was even up.

All the good things in it I liked are the same things I liked about rift, world of warcraft, everquest and so on so I'll just cut to what I didn't like about SW:TOR.

1) The engine and game isn't optimized at all. Even my computer (which is way way above reccomended specs and will run any game on the market with headroom to spare) never ran it smoothly, especially at any higher end settings. It always felt like it was running just a little too sluggish. Bioware said the massive complaints about performance were due to so many people running inferior computers but that isn't the case really. The games engine simply isn't optimized well enough. The graphics are subpar as well. I am never one to think that good graphics will equal good game but given a game where you're basically repeating the same actions day in and day out it should atleast look pretty while doing it. WOW looks better to me and it's a dated engine, but it's wonderful use of color and art direction makes it stand out while TOR has this underlying feel of looking like a dozen other games.

2) It requires you to use EA's origin service. This is ultimately why I canceled my subscription and won't play this anymore. Origin was the last straw for me in my list of complaints. Origin IS spyware, it tells you it is in the EULA you agree to when you agree to the terms and conditions to install it. It also was recently changed to say you can't sue EA. There is a reason why germany (yes the whole country) took action against Origin because it invades privacy. I detest origin and again was the last straw in my choosing not to play battlefield 3 anymore. And as someone tried to point out in the comments section that origin isn't required, yes it is and the gams official FAQ says so. [...]

3) The game is a theme park much like WOW. Once you start playing you're constantly guided through the game via quests and so on. It never felt like I got to explore anything on my own or discover anything because the game was always holding my hand and telling me where to go. There was no sense of awe, no sense of exploration, no sense of discovery because you're constantly having the game tell you what and where to go next as you progress through the game. It's like there is a invisible path of quests you have to follow through from level 1 to 50.

4) The game is too easy and that makes most people you meet insufferable to be around. Much like everyother mmo out now the game is geared toward allowing in anyone who wants to play to get maximum subscriptions. In order to do that you need to appeal to the lowest common denominator by making your game as easy as you can get away with. Much like wow it takes little effort to level up and do things aside from the occasional time you need a party to do something (which makes it feel inconvient). You never get this feeling of accomplishing anything by overcoming a challenge because the game has no real challenges or penalties. The problem with a MMO like this and it being easy is that when it becomes easy then players get bored easily and bored players become obnoxious players and obnoxious players are players I don't want to play with. There is a reason why the majority of the player base for like WOW are petty, obnoxious and sarcastic brats and why the majority of the everquest player base are friendlier, kinder and more helpful and that reason is because WOW makes players lazy and bored by being way to easy to play and everquest requires work and teamwork. Even death has virtually no penalty, there is no real reason to be careful or thrill of being almost taken down. In this if you die it is just sort of a ho-hum experince and you go on not really caring, thus there is no element of danger.

5) Everything feels like one big corridor. It always feels like you're being funneled through this corridor from one objective to the next. There is no sense of a large scale and all the areas feel so small and cramped. Once you have checked out a area it feels even smaller. At first everything was fine but it didn't take long before all the area, dungeons and so on all just start feeling like little compartments in a rat maze.

6) It doesnt take long before everything starts to run together. Much like every other mmo once you start playing everything is cool but after a few weeks all the players and areas start to look the same, have the same feel to them and nothing becomes interesting to check out anymore, even new areas to you are more of the same.

7) The quests are still fetch me this, go kill 20 of that, take this to that person and so on. Its essentially just like WOW where the quests drive the game and just like WOW and every other mmo the quests are boring and trite. The story was cool for a bit in here though till I found myself not paying attention to it anymore because I was bored of them. So basically the questing system is tired and boring. I miss everquest in the sense quests were few and far between, the game was more about exploring, playing with others, crafting and killing stuff. TOR relies heavily on doing repetitive and snooze worthy quests just like every other mmo. I am tired of having to go kill X amount of something or picking up something off the ground to bring back.

8) It feels more like a massively single player game instead of a massively multiplayer game. It feels more like a giant single player game where you occasionally have to work with a tiny group of others, rest of the time other players are just there to make the game feel more alive by running around and talking to each other. There is no sense of teamwork, no sense of community and no sense of comradery at all. It's essentially a single player game set in a giant chat room. Essentially it all feels like a me me me me single player game with co-op thrown in for when you need something but can't get it yourself.

9) Space combat is on rails. While I wasn't expecting a flight simulator here it just felt so un-needed and thrown together at the last minute. It feels more like a game they should have added to play to pass time while waiting for a friend to log in instead of trying to claim its a feature.

10) Once again crafting is pointless and just in there as a time sink and to keep people from complaining that other mmo game's have crafting of some sort. Aside from just a few things crafting on the whole is a waste of time and doesn't benefit the player or the games economy at all. There is no sense of bartering for crafted goods either, basically you make stuff to vendor off or hope some low level guy might buy it when in reality they won't because quests provide what they need. The fact you can also have your crew harvest for you and such is ez-mode laziness.

Basically I could go on and on but I won't bother because in the end this is just yet another mmo that is trying to be WOW and trying to be the WOW killer. I honestly wish they would have just re-created the entire star wars galaxies game for the modern age with a healthy helping of new content because SWG (before the big easy mode patch) was what a real star wars mmo should have been and was. I would play TOR if it had a 5 dollar fee, but I'm not paying 60 bucks for a game and 15 bucks a month to play something that bores me and is just like every other mmo in creation.

So my advice is skipping over this and just wait for guild wars 2 or secret world. Or if you're itching to scratch your mmo itch then try one of the many free ones like shin megami tenesi online, dc universe online, everquest 2 free, dungeons and dragons online, runes of magic, lord of the ring online, or even world of tanks. But I can not reccomend paying to play this game.","Same old, same old.",1326240000,64,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

1.0,True,"04 24, 2017",AC2L5LTX8GP1A,B01GW3POY0,brainiac,"When I first started this game, I will admit that I was pretty involved. Although it is not by any means a Resident Evil game - it is a generic game based on 20 years of horror cliche that they slapped the Resident Evil / Biohazard name on to move a few more copies - it was pretty interesting at first. When you are taken hostage and then have to sneak around the house, playing in VR I was genuinely scared and creeped out.

Then you make it to the garage and burn donuts in a small room with a giant named Jack, and the whole thing falls apart.

I'm not going to go too deep into spoilers, but I have to say this is a bad game. It's dumb, it's repetitive, it is unoriginal (every horror cliche in the world is in this game - letters from your 'dead' wife, creepy town, hillbillies with questionable dietary habits, Blair Witch, torture porn, gross-out, etc. etc). There is zero replay value (is not even worth playing through once). There are no real puzzles, in fact the only mildly challenging puzzle is repeated. The environments aren't interesting, the story is dumb, the enemies are boring bullet sponges.

I honestly can't imagine why it has such a high rating on this site. And everyone keeps repeating that dumb line about ""a return to form"", which only indicates they've never played a Resident Evil game before (this is nothing like Resident Evil of the past, which is what a ""return to form"" means).

After dealing with a faulty Astro Mixamp and receiving such poor support from their customer service, I had high hopes for this controller. The idea and layout is fantastic. I love the sliders and the potential functionality compared to the Astro mixamp. I could never get proper mic monitoring with the TR Mixamp or the M80 Mixamp, so I was excited about an actual volume control for this. And honestly, that was literally the only thing that worked with this audio controller. Me being able to hear myself well. But, no one else could hear me well at all...

The game audio that came through was unbelievable hollow and distorted. Pathetic would be an understatement. I mean fresh out of the box it sounded horrible. I tried multiple levels and I even tried other cables that I have had from previous products and headsets. Nothing sounded good. And if I were to touch it sometimes it would hollow out the sound more and there was just way too much static. If I had it turned up past about 65% the static would make its way through. Even with the mic muted or the mic dettached. So, the only way I could get any sound remotely quality is if it would have to be turned way down. Which, to be honest, even if the sound wasn't of such poor quality and I had the ability to turn it up loud, it still wasn't loud enough. It just feels like the amp inside is not powerful enough to do what it is supposed to be doing. For god sakes everything sounds better when I just plug my headset directly into the controller and that's only one cable instead of all these wires all over the place.

It also has Bluetooth so you can use A2DP headphones or sync your Bluetooth enabled phone for use as a Bluetooth modem (haven't gotten this to work yet).

Those are the only things I can say good about the PSP Go.

Sony is the king of proprietary, and this device is the crown jewel for this family: they have removed the MS Duo Pro slot and replaced it with a MS M2 slot- a memory slot that can be found only on this device and some Sony Ericsson phones.  The M2 is about the same size as a MicroSD, but Sony continues to push their dead-end formats.

The thing that really pissed me off is the new proprietary USB cable they are now using; all of the prior devices had a MiniUSB cable, but this has what appears to be a perversion of an Apple connector- and these cables sell for $15 if you want a second one.  I will be returning my PSP Go as I do not want to carry a specific cable with me just to charge the non-removable battery.

The power charge plug is absent- replaced by charging over the USB cable (which plugs into the included power brick).  For one bit of irony, the PSP Go dock (sold seperately for $30) includes no cables- but it can accept power input from an older model PSP charger...

Next up is the omission of the UMD drive- which means you must purchase and download all games direct from Sony- at list price.  If you download a game directly to to PSP Go, you cannot use the device while downloading- which will take 45min - an hour (depending on the game)- and then the game must extract/install (taking another 5-10 minutes).  Using the PC desktop requires the PSP to be plugged in for download.  The only alternative to this is to download on a PS3 (which will do background downloading) and then extract the game to a USB attached PSP.

The change in form factor ensures that no devices made for the earlier model PSPs will work on this version; chargers/USB Cables/video output cables/GPS/camera/etc.

If you own a PSP and already have media on UMD and want to play it on your new PSP Go, you are pretty much screwed- unless you want to purchase a second copy at full list price.

While you may find some UMD games sale for $10-$15 at your local retailer, Sony usually wants you to pay a little more for the comparable download from their store- and also accept that you will not get a physical disc that can be traded/sold at a later date when you grow bored with the game.  The download games should be MUCH cheaper than their retail counter-parts; no media = no resale value for the end user.

The battery is non-removable and smaller so it lasts about 2-3 hours (max) if you are playing games.  Charging time is also 2-3 hours.

The analog stick feels pretty solid, but the location it is in makes it uncomfortable to use if you need to use the 'L Button' (now located behind the screen).

The volume control is located on top of the unit- which is behind the screen when it is opened- making me turn the unit over to change the volume level while playing a game.

I can go on, but I think you get the picture.

I don't see how Sony hopes to make this device work with all the hacks and limitations they have imposed on it.

So when I got this game included in a bundle with my XBox 360 I was interested to play it and possible learn a little more about the story.

That was my goal for playing it and judging if it would be successful. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Basically you drop into a bar with no explanation of controls or where you or (or even who you are!) Instead you're instantly walking around with a bunch of lego people who all look the same. Nothing in the area was able to be interacted with and none of the people would talk to you. What's even worse, I found out I could attack the people but they suddenly produced guns and tons of armored people stormed in and started attacking me.

I finally figured out I was in some sort of ""HUB"" area, and proceed to the door in the north west which lead to ""Episode I"". Some scrolling text went by in true Star Wars fashion but it didn't say anything useful. It didn't explain who I was or where I was going.

I'm suddenly dropped into a strange conference room. Without all the people I learned that I had an AI controlled partner that I could switch to, who seemed to be better than the main character. Upon attacking the chairs they would shoot out coins that I was collecting for who knows what reason. Shouldn't I be collecting LEGOs?

I played further, pushed through this level which consisted of getting a bunch of strange robots and making them stand on platforms in order to open doors and finally I was entered into a jungle level where I was saving Jabba the Hut or something. There was a huge war/invasion going on and it was pretty cool how everything was going on around me, and the enemies didn't always pay attention to me because they were doing other things.

However I still rate this game a 1 because gameplay was juvenile (walk, jump, attack, get character X who is the only one who can do Y, then switch back to character A because hes the only one who can do B) and if you were hoping, like me, for any sort of story you'll be sorely disappointed. I don't get why all the LEGO games are so critically acclaimed - maybe its meant for people who know the story of the game they're playing or maybe it is meant for children who enjoy mindlessly hitting things and getting ""coins"".","When you don't want to read the book - watch the movie, when you don't want to watch the movies - play the game?",1306022400,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Half of the missions are impossible to finish unless you figure out some sort of gimmick. Most missions force you to research them on the Internet.
There is no sense of reality at all. For instance, at one point you are shooting into a giant frame of steel girders, but you can only fire when the ""doors"" are open, even though it's just a giant, open framework. There is a submarine that your weapons can't damage, so you have to lure enemy aircraft into crashing into it. Again, use the Internet to understand how to finish the missions.
Most missions have a wingman, and while you are trying to do your task, you often have to keep an eye on the wingman symbol to keep reminding them to go and do something. It's so distracting that it really detracts from the game.
The game introduces too many random elements of play. Instead of flying and shooting, some of the first things you do include tail gunning, using a bomb sight, and intercepting a train at just the right spot so that you can hover over it for several seconds. These might make nice diversions after several missions, but they are some of the first things you do and just add to the random, haphazard feel of the game.
There are several ""cheat codes"" available, but if you use them they lock out the achievements. I presume the cheat codes were released to make up for how difficult the game can be. Frankly, people ought to be able to finish a game. Publishers can certainly add some harder modes for re-playability, but it's just ridiculous to make a game difficult to understand just to add hours of play. On the plus side, the game rates your performance in each mission so you could re-play them for a higher rating. Also, your rating earns ""prestige points"" that are used to buy upgrades. You might find it necessary to earn more points just to get the upgrades for later missions.
The game booklet is worthless for understanding how to play the game. It doesn't explain how to use some of the more obscure controls and it doesn't explain the map symbols. You just have to play and lose until you gradually figure it out.
The plot is ridiculous. So ridiculous that it's annoying. The plot is explained through voice acting (not stellar, but I've heard worse) and artwork. Fairly crude.
Some of the missions are fairly enjoyable, as they aren't all timed and don't all require completing a bizarre task. But far too many of the missions are simply repeating the same frustrating sequence until you figure out some gimmick that isn't explained anywhere except an Internet post by someone who also got stuck.","many, many flaws",1329523200,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Commentary was padded out a bit, but they should be trying to super-expand commentary every year with more stories and more situational things to say. It's not acceptable to hear the same line repeated multiple times in a single game. That's not at all ""next-gen"" in my book.

Doc & Eddie are the most annoying and nasal commentators ever, and it's not only just how they sound, but also in what they say. Lots of redundant and awkward comments like ""kitty cornered to the corner"" and ""its over. the game is over."" and ""he hit somebody."" just the stupidest things I've ever heard any commentary say. NHL14 commentary was a great base and they should have just expanded it.

We still don't have any more options to modify our game experience than we did years ago. The sliders stay pretty much the same. The in-game option to disable the feedback window still hasn't been implemented.

BAP needs some in-game cutscenes for different activities, like the gym, school, practice, and they should also start trying to make BAP be more of a drama with a girl who likes you and maybe encourages you to play your best each game to win her affection (lol). Who says it has to be a pure hockey game every single year? EA needs to start expanding the hockey game experience to include the different social aspects and challenges surrounding it, including romance, school, etc. Right now all we have are a few buttons to push and sliders to indicate how much we're liked by fans, family, team, and management. That's pure laziness on EA's part. They just rest back on their laurels year after year because they know they've got a guaranteed income from doing just a few tweaks and trying to up-sell them as major advancements in their product.

There are no random events that can occur, which greatly reduces replayability. Any genius game or A.I. designer should know that it's programming in random irrational behaviors that makes things feel less like a computer and more like a living world where anything can happen. The refs should be possible to knock over, coaches should be able to get mad and run onto the ice, a play may fall suddenly ill and need to leave, a fight may break out in the crowd, an obsessive fan may be present at a game every now and then -- pounding on the glass and yelling things at specific players, maybe security takes him away, or ignores him for most of the game.

Still no love for the girls. While FIFA is expanding their game with female teams and leagues, there's still no sign of NWHL presence in the NHL series. It would be good to have just for diversity and to help get more girls interested in playing these games.

There are other things I could bring up, but the main point is that EA could and should be doing a lot more to further their hockey franchise than they have been doing. I jumped in at NHL14 (since SNES days) and while NHL14 is a great experience and I love BAP, the last 2 installments have shown me just how slow their idea of progress is. They need to work on their cinematics, presentation, kick out and find new commentators (imo), plus lots of other things. For NHL16 it seems they have a solid gameplay down from puck physics to skate physics and physical interaction between everything. Now they need to stop messing with that and get to work on other areas of gameplay improvement, including A.I., options and everything I already mentioned earlier.

Did this game have potential? Absolutely. It had massive potential. The characters look nice and cartoon-like, there are more than 8, and you could play online at one point. But what is a game if the game play is less than sub-par?

The amount of content in this game is extremely lacking. You can win a few new characters but that's about it. There is a challenge mode but you must beat 22 people in 250 seconds. Those 2 things are your main things you can do in this game. As far as characters, you start out with Ken, Ryu, Bison, Sagat, Zangief, and Balrog... I mean who else does anyone care about in the SF universe enough to buy a game just to play them?

The fighting is somewhat fun but it has so many flaws it is ridiculous. The CPU you fight has what I like to term Metaknowledge where you can be inputting your Haduken buttons and already the computer is lifting up, coming down with an attack to dodge your fire ball and hit you in a combo that takes half of your life.

When you jump to kick someone, they can break from anything they are doing (anything) no matter how complex and stop to hit you out of the air because their timing is so precise you can't walk up to them, you can't jump to them and come down with an attack, and out of the blue if you are able to get in an attack from jumping it will be blocked, the bottom kick will be blocked, and you will be countered with a grab.

Metaknowledge in video games irks me to no end. The AI can hit you no matter what you are doing but they will dodge and block anything you do. Not only that, they will counter you with a 5 hit combo and top it off with their special move which they seem to charge up much faster than you. Pretty much 15 seconds and you're toast.

My main beef with the game is if you can get past all of the metaknowledge the game has, the last boss battle is against a creature named Seth. He is pretty much like the wooden guy from Tekken in that he is a mix of all characters in one. He can teleport, he can stretch his limbs out, he can shoot things at you, he can and will combo you like crazy. He will do the thing where he stands there until you are JUST at the nanosecond of standing up and he will attack you mercilessly to knock you down in which the cycle will repeat itself. He will counter any inch of a move you make and hit you with about 5-10 hits in each counter. Even on ""Very Easy"" he is still a struggle. So much so that there are videos online showing how you can turn the game on the easiest mode just to beat him.

Is that really how you want to remember a street fighter game? Where God willing you make it to the last boss you need to have it on the easiest mode you can have it on just to be able to stand a chance? So you have unenjoyable and frustrating fighting, a major lack of content, and a lack of reason to play as you will just be trolled like some bad joke the developers threw in for a final boss fight no matter what character you are playing with.

Virtually, with the lack of content and horrid game play, the only thing I commend this game on is its graphics...which is not enough to get me to play it because I'm here for game play.

1.0,False,"11 20, 2006",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000G7PMX2,Tsanche,"This was the first Wii game I got, and its mostly because I couldn't get a hold of Zelda.  Red Steel looks promising.  Certainly its controls are good, but it feels more like a game that's supposed to get you used to using the remote and nunchuck attachment.  A tutorial of sorts.  The problem is that it isn't much fun to deal with.

You play as Scott, a man in Japan with his girlfriend.  You suddenly find out that her father is a Yakuza Mob boss and that he's got tons of enemies.  Your girlfriend gets kidnapped and so its up to you to save her, ultimately getting yourself involved in this family struggle.  It's pretty simple stuff.  Most of the game is told through voice acted cutscenes or graphic novel like storyboards.  The graphic novel storyboards look interesting, but its really painful that you can't skip any of these cinematics or storyboard cutscenes.  This is especially annoying when you die and you have to listen to the same objective over and over again.

Red Steel's appeal is its gameplay, which seems to be the focus of the game.  The controls are solid, for the most part, but again, the whole game seems like a tutorial to get used to the Wii remote.  You use the remote to aim at enemies and the B button to shoot.  The nunchuck allows you to pick up weapons, reload said weapon and tip over tables (you'll know what can be accessed because it has a golden outline around it).  The nunchuck is also how you'll move around.  You can strife from side to side and you can move forward.  The nunchuck also allows you to jump and duck.  You'll be doing a lot of ducking.

The remote is responsible for most of the gameplay.  It allows you to turn from one side of the screen to another.  The game itself will help you get adjusted with a tutorial provided at the beginning of the game (with your grifriend directing you what fish to look at).  You'll be able to use the remote for several things.  You can lock onto enemies with the A button and if you hold the A button you can zoom into enemies by moving the wii remote closer to the screen, or you can zoom out.  It's all pretty cool, but the remote is extremely sensitive.  Just the slightest flick to the left and you'll look to the left.  It's great to actually point and shoot at an enemy, your accuracy is really important, but now it's all up to you whether or not you hit an enemy.  Granted, the controls take time to get used to, but they flow particularly well.

Swordfights are another story, though.  These are annoying sequences actually.  Mostly because the controls are clumbsy.  You'll have to swing your sword using the wii remote and you'll parry and dodge attacks using the nunchuck.  At first this is fun, but its so limited.  When fighting with swords you can't pull out a weapon.  This is bad when you're in the middle of a firefight and some guy has a sword.  You'll be forced into the sword fight even when all the enemies using guns are still up.  And they'll STILL fire at you and you'll lose health.  There's no way to back out of sword fights either, and that's also really annoying.  The controls just feel clumbsy as well, especially with its extreme sensitivty.

To the gameplay's credit, there are some interesting things you can do.  For starters, when you're not shooting someone and you're ducking behind something, your health refills.  At first this makes the game seem easy, but you have to understand that if you're taking damage, or shooting at all, your health doesn't refill.  So this doesn't make the game incredibly easy.  Also, after a sword fight, you'll have the choice of finishing your attacker off or sparing his life.  Sparing his life earns you respect, which you can use to learn more techniques.

The game doesn't look fantastic, but it's not bad looking either.  It's visual presentation is alright, but the part of the graphics that lacks are the games numerous bugs and glitches.  There are moments where you'll be staring an enemy right in the face and he won't move.  Won't flinch or even attack you.  He just stands there waiting to be killed.  Sometimes enemies will run right past you or claim they can't see you when you're in plain sight.  There are also moments where I shot an enemy in the back and neither him nor his comrades even acknowledged my existence.  There are probably more bugs than this found within the game, but it was hard to take after a while.

There are a couple of other annoying aspects of the gameplay as well.  You can only hold two weapons at a time.  This isn't as annoying as it sounds, but I wish I could've held on to more.  Luckily, ammo is not hard to come by at all.  There are also glitches such as your bullets passing right through an enemy while he takes you out.  Enemies shooting through walls.  This game is just full of them.

I wish I could say it sounds good, but it doesn't.  The voice acting is very mediocre and the soundtrack isn't great either.  Some levels sound good, but there's nothing memorable here.

Red Steel has a good control scheme going for it but that's really all it has going for it.  It's not a fantastic game by any means.  The bugs and glitches strewn throughout are also just really annoying.  It's hard to recommend this game, even to die hard first person shooter fans.

The Good

+The control scheme works

+Well, there is lots of action

The Bad

-Tons of bugs and glitches found throughout the whole game: enemies who don't attack, or walk right past you.  Enemies who can't see you in plain sight.  Bullets going through walls or through your enemies... this game is full of them and they detract from the gameplay

-Sword fighting is clumbsy

-You can only wield two weapons at once.

-When you're forced into a sword fight, there's no way you can get out of it until the fight is over

-Horrible voice acting

-There's really no story to it

-The controls, while good, just seem like another ploy to get one used to the Wii Remote",Pretty Annoying,1163980800,7,,

I have pleanty of reasons but let me give you the jist of it. Now see first of the price of the adapter alone is pleanty enough to put someone down. Hell I love online gaming but 40 some bucks taken out of my pocket to do it is a little too much. The adapter is fine within itself. The problem I have with it, is just the online capabilities. Now first off installing and connecting the adapter to your PS2 (...)takes way to much time. Another thing is the booklet which they give you and expect you to read it is like a chapter book not a manuel. In order to start playing you must put the disc in which is given within the package and sit through a long tidius process. It is not as simple as to plug it in and play instead they had to create a long difficult process.

Another problem with this product is the capabilities with the games. First of the games are very limited...From that I mean the choice in which one has to play from. Eventually I know more games will come out...But eventually PS3 will come out won't it? Nevertheless for the games that are compatiable with this adapter the connectivity servers suck ass!!

The overhead world looks nice, and the graphics are pretty decent, But what good is a game that starts off way too difficult on the first level? The time trial is way too difficult, but like most games the requirement for getting the gold medal for a time trial or other challenge is not too demanding. Another complaint i have is the controls. The wii remote is good for alot of things, but not for this game. To execute this  DK rolling move, you shake the remote. Now why do we not have the option to use a gamecube controller like we did in mario kart wii and SSBB, it is not like the wii was incapable of using the gamecube controller port for wii games.  That DK roll comes in handy with the time trials, but it is almost impossible to get the gold medal in the 1st level because it is a distraction to have to shake the remote while using the D-pad to move and a button to jump. An ideal way to play was to have the option to use a gamecube controller and have the DK roll assigned to the X button, but for some reason you cant use a gamecube controller. I know this is the wii and people want to utilize the wii's motion controls, but in this situation, it would have been best to use a gamecube controller. Games like mario party 8 and zelda twilight princess actually fully utilize the wiimote's motion controls.

I was even surprised to find how much my wife enjoys Just Dance 2014, Zumba World Party and Xbox Fitness (she's never been into any sort of gaming at all) thanks to the new Kinect.  The kids love Skylanders and I'm really enjoying Assassin's Creed, Dead Rising 3 and the T.V. voice functionality.  I feel like I made the right decision in terms of getting a system we can all enjoy some aspect of.  The bad part is that my system had to go back.  Luckily, Microsoft's support is great and it's easy to get an advanced return if you don't mind a $500 hold on your credit card (I don't consider that horrible anyway).  My controllers are constantly disconnecting from the unit.  This affects both the bundled controller and an extra controller I bought.  After going through Microsoft's support forums, I found a huge 24+ (and growing) page thread of people having the same problem, many of which resolved it with a new console.  Apparently, it's the central unit that is the source of the problem, in case any of you are dealing with the cycle of getting new controllers with no luck (and assuming you also already figured out you need to stuff some paper in the battery compartment to keep the batteries from sliding around when the controller vibrates and haven't solved the issue that way).  I'm hoping I won't be one of the unlucky few that did an exchange and got back a unit with other problems.  It does seem like Microsoft's QA needs some work but I can't deny that the experience shows promise.

Update:  I realize this will drag the review score down by those who rate reviews based on their own product loyalties but it has to be said...  I got an advanced exchange and it took care of the controllers constantly dropping their connection.  It hasn't happened once since.  Microsoft did send me an email that my credit card was going to be charged for never returning the original unit (over a week after I sent it back with their shipping label) but the charge never happened and I eventually got another email with a notice that it was received.  Now, however, my XBox is making a grinding sound when I put in a disc and it won't read anything after the sound.  I looked it up and it's an infamouse ""disc grinding"" issue.  I went to get another advanced exchange and this time I'm ineligible, I presume because I've had an advanced exchange already.  I suppose I'm up a creek at this point but I'll plead with their support to help me out here.  I have to say, the experience has been just too full of issues to properly recommend this system.  Lowered review to 2 stars.

Update 2:  I ended up going through a grueling customer support session of all kinds of stupid shut-down, reset to factory settings, etc. procedures for my non-working disc drive.  In the end, I ended up having to send the unit in for repairs.  The order was created on 4/22 and I just checked the service status.  It says they expect to complete repairs by 5/22 so it's going to be a while.  Unfortunately, I already spent too much money on games, Xbox Live Gold (practically required), etc.  If I hadn't, I'd have jumped ship by now and gone with a PS4.

1.0,False,"11 22, 2014",A3K4PHZJMMCZ8K,B00KSQACMM,MoLarryCurly,"EDIT 2: I contacted TB support and after filling out some information and sending them pictures, I was able to RMA the defective headset back. The cost to ship was about $18 which included insurance and signature. Two weeks after TB received my cracked headset, they shipped me a brand new set, which I received the first week of December. I've been using the new set for roughly a month. I have wrapped both extensions with a Loctite reinforced clear wrap to provide some additional support; hopefully this will help prevent it from cracking. Only time will tell.

EDIT: I used this headset without any major issue for about 4 months. After that I noticed cracking on the right and left side headset extensions. I take great care of all my gaming gear. As noted below, I own the X41 and Tango. I have owned them for a few years. Both still work great -- not withstanding a few nits here and there. Unfortunately, the Stealth 500X is not designed to the same standard in terms of durability. If you do a search you will come across MANY owners who are experiencing the exact same break at the same location on the extensions. I have contacted TB and sent pictures so hopefully they will respond and rectify the issue. Other than the extensions breaking, my review below still holds. It's a nice headset for gaming. I just hope they fix the design flaw.

First, I'd like to say that I currently own and use the Turtle Beach X41s, Ear Force Tangos and recently the Stealth 500X. This review is based on my experience with using the headset with first person shooter type games.  I do not have any experience with music or movies.

Pros:

- Easy to set up: First, download the Ear Force Audio Hub from the Turtle Beach Web Site and install it on your computer/laptop. Unbox the 500X and connect both receiver and headset to your computer using usb/micro usb connectors.  Open the audio hub and allow it to update itself.  After it updates it will automatically recognize your hardware and install the latest firmware for both receiver and headset.  This is very important as many bugs have been fixed including the low volume issue that many are complaining about.  Volume may still be too low for music/movies as this review is focused on gaming.

Once the headset and receiver are updated you can follow the simple installation to your smart TV or Xbox One. It doesn't matter you can connect to either. My preference would be to connect to the Xbox One as this headset is exclusively made for it. This would potentially free up your smart TV (assuming you have one) for another headset such as the X41s. I currently have my 500X connected to my Xbox One and my X41 connected to the TV. I can use both at the same time if need be.

- Good variety of presets and easy to figure out from the quick start guide.  You can also ""replace"" default presets with additional ones using the audio hub. For example, I replaced a few of my default movie presets with some that are more geared towards first person shooters such as footstep focus and super human hearing.

- Controls on the left/right ear cups are adequate and provide enough choices without having to worry about complicated sound editing and programming.  For example, I can't tell you how many hours I spent fine tuning my programmable Ear Force Tangos before I was happy with the sound.  The programming guide and videos were not easy to follow and took some time/research to figure out.  The time/effort needed to program isn't for everyone.  The 500X has taken this concern off the table.  It provides rich sound and gives two or three choices without having to worry about programming.

- 7.1 dolby digital surround sound is excellent. It's on part with other Turtle Beach 7.1 dolby digital surround sound models.  Mic monitor is also a big plus for anyone that has used it. The 500X gives three choices, off, low and high. I typically keep mine on high when gaming  online with friends.

- Completely wireless. No chat cable to the controller like my X41. Works like the Tango/XP510 for the Xbox 360 only it doesn't use Bluetooth so the chat is more clear (not perfect but better than Bluetooth technology for the 360).

- I've used it for over 8 hours so far on the same charge (it's rated for 15 hours). My Tangos never lasted more than 8 hours depending on how I used them.

- Very comfortable and light weight. More so then my X41. The 500X cups are somewhat oval so If you have big ears like I do they're comfortable to wear for hours.  My X41s begin to bother me after a couple of hours of use.

- Typical hard plastic study build. No complaints with the materials including the fabric ear cups. I actually prefer them over the fake leather that my Tangos use as those make my scalp around my ears sweat after some hours of playing.

Con:

- A little pricey at $230 plus tax.  One tip - go to turtlebeach.com, enter your e-mail address in their mailing list (follow the advertisement) and retrieve the 10% coupon code.  At this point you can either purchase on their site or you can use an option they offer to purchase with your Amazon account info.  By doing this you get a 10% discount on the headset, no tax purchasing through the turtle beach web page and no shipping charge. Your total cost is $207.

- Mic sound is not as clear as using a chat cable. There's nothing like my X41 (or equiv.) with chat cable connected to the controller, but the trade-off is no cable. Anyway, 500X mic technology is better then the last generation Bluetooth, but can still use improvement.

- Some sound seems to come through the cups as the headset doesn't fit too tight on the head. They're similar to my X41s. My Tangos are more ""sound tight"" and emit less sounds. The Tangos are also tighter on my head and took some getting use to, which these do not.  Not a huge problem just something of note.

Overall: worth the price ($207) if you require a completely hands free 7.1 dolby digital experience. Remember to configure the Xbox One sound settings correctly or you won't get any sound! Look at the TB web site or Xbox One FAQs for support on what sound settings to use.",Poor design and materials causes plastic extension to crack and break with just a few months of use,1416614400,19,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1.0,True,"09 4, 2014",AK99N02LJ6YDT,B00DBRM3G8,Wild Rover,"I waited a long time to write a review for this game. I am a long time 2K fan, but what I really liked is when they started the my career mode. I have found a lot that I really don't like. Keep in mind I am only reviewing the my career section of the game.

Let me start with what everyone is complaining about. The VC! This game has turned into a money grabbing nightmare. Just the micro transactions alone ruin the game in my opinion. Sure you can earn it through play, but it takes a long time and you just don't make enough from game to game to make it worth it spending on anything besides player attributes.

Over emphasis on signature skills. This one is really agitating. I had an athletic center, 7th 2inchs, max vertical, and maxed out blocking and struggle to average 1 block a game. Add eraser and chase down artist and suddenly I was averaging 5.6 blocks a game. To me this is bs. They should place more emphasis on the players timing than making them use a ton of VC to get something that just makes their character react how he should in the first place being he's in the NBA. If this was high school basketball, okay cool.

That leads into a whole other problem. How terrible they start your career player at. You can't make a layup,  run down the court, dunk at 7ft 2in or pass, dribble or rebound. You are useless and belong at a grocery store, not on a basketball court. That coupled with the horrible attempt at a story line that also ruins the experience in and of itself. No words can express how miserable it is. You feel like you playing someone else's save with the stupid junk your player does and says.

Next we have position bias. Yes, if you are a center or a power forward,  you are automatically and are huge disadvantage. Both post positions are automatically cut out in the opening cut scene where your character is clearly a guard. Unfortunately that cut scene is what the rest of the game is like. Your 7ft 2 center will, post up for threes instead of roll to the basket on a pic and roll, spin layup, refuse to dunk under the basket. Miss post shots, but somehow knockdown jumpers? Furthermore, guards will out rebound you. My center was on the Timberwolves,  Rubio would out rebound me nearly every time we went head to head. This was also true with,  Tony Parker,  derrick rose, rajon rondo, jru holiday, and Daron Williams to name a few. In fact my center only averaged 6 rebounds a game! That's even with all the stats maxed out and all the signature skills for rebounding. So I made a 7ft small forward with the same signature skills as a test. Sure enough,  I know average 10 rebounds and 4 blocks (block stat maxed ar 75!) a game. I out rebound other centers and power forwards. This is really sad, being the small forwards rebound and block stats max out way lower than the centers do. It's obvious this game was made for people who wanted to be sf/sg/pg positions.

Lastly, the lack of actual basketball in the game. The AI for team mates is abysmal. There is no give and go, no pick and roll (your player actually freezes until the defender gets back on you), they never allyoop you or get you shots you can actually take. They throw you the ball and you are on your own. No one makes cuts, no one sets picks. It's obviously set up for someone to waltz down the lane and make lay up, or even more likely,  launch 3s.

With two factors that alone make this a one star, the VC/Micro transactions and the horrible attempt at a story line make this such a let down.

Let me cut to the quick -

Brothers in Arms tries to be Call Of Duty with squad based action. IT FAILS MISERABLY!!!!!!

This game tries to offer a really solid, SQUAD based game. No more typical First Person shooter. In other words, you don't go running full speed shooting everything in site! And your squad mates actually do help you defeat the enemy.

Game graphics -

This game runs on the Unreal Engine so I expected top of the line graphics. You get far less than that! Even the soldiers have NO facial expressions. Their lips move but the face does not change or offer any emotion or expression. Stick lips on a 2""x6"" pine plank and you will get the same experience!!!

Nice selection...but highly inaccurate!!! To get any accurate shooting done, you MUST aim down the barrel. With all the fast action going on, you have no time to aim and line up a shot. If you shoot with out aiming, you better be 2 feet away from the guy...and even then they will kill you quick!!!

You will not get the chance to use many of the weapons either...unless you hunt on the ground for the dead soldiers dropped weapons.

Gameplay -

Squad based activity is decent but repetitive. The missions are almost pointless and definitely are redundant! It winds up turning into the same thing everytime. Get ready, start the mission, Germans appear, order your squad to provide cover fire while you flank them and kill them. Wash, rinse and repeat....until the game is finally done!

Game Length -

Short and not creative. I finished this game on the Difficult setting in 7 hours. I finished it on the hardest setting in 10 hours. Too short and the gameplay is so clumsy at times that you just don't want to play it again. Not rewarding at all.","Good attempt, CRAPPY results......Don't buy it!!!!!",1111968000,,,

First is the absolutely terrible, mandatory, Razer software.  You to create an account and install the Razer Synapse 2.0 software to even install or update drivers for the keyboard.  Ridiculous.  This would have been a deal breaker for me had I known about it.  Synapse does nothing to improve the end user experience, in fact it makes it worse.

If asked to expound on that review with a one word justification it would be this; Grind.

And honestly that's the distilled essence of this game. This game is not so much a game as much as it is an interminable grind thru terrible easter eggs scenes where everyone muyst teach me how to Spider-Man because the games controls were just way to convoluted. Now don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with complexity, but when that complexity exists only to compensate for the rather slap dash programming it becomes an issues.

Take for example the countless ""special moves"" which require pin point timing & only when the game wants you to use them. So they'll drill you on this special move, demand you can do it perfectly & then you'll never use it again in real play because it's not as useful as the basic moves, unless of course the game suddenly expects you to be able to execute that move perfectly 4 hours in to the game even though you forgot it straight after you realised it wasn't as useful as just punching a dude.

But even just punching guys feels like a grind, it doesn't make me want to see more of it, it makes me want to do what I did: Uninstall the game, put it back in to the book shelf & reinstall it every couple of years to see if it's still as terrible as I remember.

And don't even get me started on wall crawling. If special moves & ground based combat feel like a grind, the poor programming on the wall crawling aspect of the game feels like whatever is more grinding than grind..... Super-Grind maybe.

The initial opening (where I was a baby with perfect cognitive skills) was different, and I like me a story-based game.  The very first segment that ends with you escaping from the underground bunker was the highlight of my five hours with the game.

I saw warning signs.  The gameplay mechanics were so un-apologetically Oblivion-based it wasn't funny.  (I also hate that game, so not a good start)  I shrugged this off, hoping the future would present itself once I got to hop and bop across the world.

Speaking of the world; it's fugly.  I mean, it's the kind of jagged landscape you expect in an early XBox game.  If you're on a hill and looking out, the scenery can be quite beautiful.  But since you are usually trudging along and looking at the same dirt/concrete/metal patterns for hours at a time...

The amount of customization and skill-building IS impressive: I must admit that.  And even though it is just Oblivion with a coat of futuristic paint, the extent of your character's abilities is pretty much limited by your imagination.

But like that other ugly slasher game, this one is a chore to reach levels of adequate carnage.  Prepare to swat mutant bees and clear out hobo-infested house husks for a while, gathering the occasional bottle caps, baseball bats, heck, if you're lucky you might find a gun with half a clip of ammo left!  This experience is at least humorous for a while, as the character animations are laughably mannequin in nature.  It brought back memories of Goldeneye 64 and the iron rod-way James bond would move with his gun.

You'll notice I haven't said much more about the story.  Let's start.  With everything else about this game going to hell, the only motivational factor left was to find my dad and continue what sounds like a pretty good adventure setup.  The voice-overs are usually well done (there are some cheese moments), but what really kills the mood is the wooden characters.  Sure, their faces show a semblance of emotion, but they all stand ramrod straight, staring directly into your soul.  This was creepy, especially with large chunks of the game missing music or even background ambiance.

Nothing gave me any indication that forward progress would bring happiness.

So, I have laid out my irks in what I hope comes off as reasonable.  I'm not bashing the game because so-and-so is better, or because it was too difficult and I didn't bother to master the controls (not much to master anyways, with 90% being a previous game).

1.0,False,"02 7, 2012",A4VF4V6A4W0H7,B0062VM8LU,Gargus,"EDIT: This preface is added in after I had written everything following this paragraph. I have reduced my score and impression of the game to 1 star from 2 because of something I recently discovered about the game in a interview with Motomu Toriyama the games director. I found out when reading this that square/enix had decided to leave the game as a cliffhanger and extend the ending through DLC. Yes thats right, if you want to see the games ending youll have to buy DLC. Aside from that evidently character stories like for Lighting and some other characters. So basically if you buy this game and you want some of the characters stories and the ENDING TO THE GAME you will have to pay extra money. Ive always strongly opposed DLC because while in essence its a neat idea but in reality it will eventually become a something to exploit more money from customers, a way to make their 60 dollar game turn into a 90 dollar game to get the whole experince you should have gotten in the first place. When you buy a game for 60 dollars and then buy DLC for it for 10 or 20 dollars you are telling developers ""Yes I am willing to spend 70 or 80 dollars on one game"" and eventually they will start charging that. But thats a story for another day. In the end if you want to beat this game and see the end be prepared to pay even more, you can find the stories easily on google by just looking for ""final fantasy xiii-2 dlc ending"".

I'm bored with this game. I last about 25 hours into it and its just a generic, clich&eacute; and mediocre rpg like square has been making for over a decade now. Sadly the reason I don't care for square games is they care more about graphics and cutscenes than they do crafting a interesting story, well designed characters and a well written and overall fun game. This is no exception to the rule because it's obvious the graphics are what they cared about first and foremost in this.

A big problem with this game is that it seems like a really great game and that its very well done, but that's because you're comparing it to the first one that was panned more or less universally. See the first one was such a big deal to everyone being a major final fantasy title on current systems on 360 and ps3 that everyone got so hyped up and when they found current gen tech still doesn't make square games any better they were severely bummed out. So by the time this one comes around its still not a very good game but it is at least what the first one should have been. So then they play this and expectations are so low that even though the game stinks its better than most think it is. Kind of spending 20 years of your only eating stale rice cakes for all your meals and then one day someone gives you a ritz cracker. Sure the ritz cracker is just a plain old boring cracker but in comparison to 20 years of rice cakes you would swear that ritz is a new york strip steak and the best tasting cracker ever created.

I just very much get the sense of ""I have been here before......A LOT of times before and I seem to recall this being more fun"". I just found myself going through the usual paces, not really paying attention to what passes for a story because its either so uninteresting I can't be bothered to pay attention or its things Ive seen before in a hundred other games or its simply so poorly thought out that it doesn't make much sense. All the characters are just generic and sterile cookie cutter Japanese style characters. The battles are easy and not much fun, the fighting becomes very grindish feeling pretty quick. Even the most action packed cut scenes still can't raise an eyebrow or heart rate because they stink of the same style and flair square has been using for a long time now.

Was also quite disappointed at the fact I hadn't even gotten my copy in the mail and I reading news of the DLC they are going to release. It makes me even less interested when a dev starts pimping dlc before the game is even cold on the shelf.

Bottom line is I should have waited till this was 20 bucks. Its generic, sterile, bland, boring, uninspired, just like a dozen other games square has done and feels more like square pulling the lever on the register than actually trying to make a game.

Essentially I equate square games and this game in particular to a big budget blockbuster hollywood movie that's directed by Michael bay. Yes it has a big name behind it, yes it had millions of dollars spent on making it, yes its special effects are impressive, yes it's been hyped up a lot, yes a lot of people are talking about it, yes its another one in a long line of sequels to a franchise. But its also really boring because its designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It's made to be like a shotgun blast trying to hit as many paying customers as quickly as possible. So essentially it has dumbed itself down in order to try and be as generic as possible so the largest amount of gamers will buy it. It has no personality, no unique feeling, no heart, no soul and it's no fun because it's purely a product created with the one and only sole intention of selling as many possible copies as it can. It wasn't created by talented people, it wasn't created with any love, it wasn't created by inspiration, no care went into it, it just simply a game created to make sales based off the fact it has the final fantasy brand name in its title and that is all. This game is to gaming what essentially michael bays transformers movies (especially the 3rd one) to film making.

With so many other really great quality games out there from talented developers I can't even begin to suggest anyone play this or purchase it. Between little downloadable games to other full price retail titles there is no real reason to spend 60 bucks or even 25 on this game. Want a newer Japanese rpg? Then go and buy atelier totori the adventurer of arland, disgaea 4, or runes factory tides of destiny instead and have a much more unique experience playing a rpg that's actually fun and tries to do its own thing.

If this game did not have the words ""final fantasy"" in it then I guarantee you the reviews would be a lower across the board. That's the problem with final fantasy is it's like rodney dangerfield in his old age; yeah he is faded, does a lot of dumb stuff and no one really likes him anymore but people will despite all of it still give him way too much room and credit because of his name. And that's what final fantasy is, its just a name that makes fanboys squee with glee and something gamers will buy even if they don't care for it just so they can be part of the crowd that plays ever FF game because it's a knee jerk reaction.

Trust me, save your money because you can buy multiple other games with what this costs and have a much better time in the end. Wait 3 months and get it for 20 bucks off ebay. Final fantasy is the proverbial old dog that can't learn new tricks and no matter how many times it will fetch the ball at some point it stops being amusing to the person throwing it and they end up doing so just because that's what they have always done.",Be prepared to spend extra for the ending.,1328572800,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First and foremost, this isn't a sim racer, so I won't judge it as such, but it also doesn't feel enjoyable like arcade racers. It's a mix of a little bit of sim and a little bit of arcade without dedicating itself to either style and it ends up feeling flat and unsatisfying because of that.

Good: Beautiful cut-scenes and game play graphics.  All around, a stunning presentation that really got my hopes up.  Very good sound effects and music as well.  The story seemed good enough, but i couldn't get too far into it because of the terrible game play.

Bad:  Where to even start.  I think the most obnoxious is the pure randomness to the combat system.  There is a giant slot machine that you have NO CONTROL over int eh corner, which dictates almost all of combat.  Want to unleash an uber-move on the boss?  Better hope you get lucky.  Don't want to use it on the lvl 1 bunny rabbit?  Too bad, it just happened.  Even lvling up is done in this annoying random slot machine.

The other blatant irritant is the 'side missions'.  You have missions (think FFVIII) that you can complete for materia, or random crappy items.  EVERY SINGLE MISSION is exactly the same.  100%.  You run through a zone, getting in random fights, until you see the dude you need to kill.  You kill him.  Mission over...

You don't have a party, it's just you solo.  And you have no gear!  You can equip materia, and that's it.

i can't even imagine paying a subscription for this garbage I've played smoother HTTP games - where the creators actually seemed to care about what their presenting and their gameplay content.

its pretty clear from the 1st few days you spend playing this garbage if you can stomach it that long, that the designers clearly are just milking a brand name with absolutely zero care factor to actually the game itself, the combat, and even movement of your character in general is SO BAD it reminds me of pre-diablo 2 clumsiness its like the creators have never played a single MMO but just kinda had an ""idea"" what an MMO is and tried to abstractly create it - which i could accept IF they actually stuck with what a Final Fantasy should be, a THRILL RIDE of AWESOME that leaves me wanting to continue to play it each step along the way with over-the-top epicness, like FF7, followed through with attention to detail and stunning cinemas - this game is NONE of that

after a little research you'll find out just how lazy the creators of this game are and who they have overseeing things, for example 3 YEARS ago apparently they messed up the ability to buy single quantity out of stacks placed on the market place - so literally if you want 1 of something you can't buy it, you'd be FORCED to buy the entire 99 stack for an obscene amount which leads to a lot of market-place scamming and just general badness and its remained that way for 3 years - 3 YEARS - and hasn't been corrected so no i doubt any fundamentals in this game are scheduled to improve - ever - they patch stuff - mess stuff up, and thats it - its DEAD JIM. - their so clearly just milking the brand name its disgusting.

for example the cinemas are extremely poorly done, words fail to describe it, maybe a 5 year old could like them, but definitely not 8-10+ their not even voiced, and the text is so corny and BAD its not thrilling or exciting in the least, the best cinema so far is the trailer, go figure. *makes a fishing reel sound*

They ""tried"" to do a Gold Saucer, i guess... the few games they do have are so lame, sadly as previously stated just a huge disappointment  FF7's Gold Saucer for example puts FF14's Saucer to shame.  They even managed to ruin Chocobo Raceing to the point that its a dead aspect in the game.  It defies logic how FINAL FANTASY could be so LAZY and PATHETIC that their predecessor game from 7 ENTIRE generations back, is better designed and more fun then their current Saucer and i think that speaks for itself with how the entire game is created and maintained.

Character Creation, is also a joke in this game - you get like so few choices on what you look like overall you end up looking like everyone else, there is ZERO ability to manually tweak your physical characteristics for example you get a set slide of choice 1-6 and thats it, so expect alot of other people to look EXACTLY or nearly exactly just like you.

I Wish i could of wrote a better review on this game i love most of the Final Fantasy games, sadly this garbage will never come close to being a real Final Fantasy.  its just a badly designed MMO ""wannabe"" with a brand name it'll never deserve.

If you want a REAL MMO i'd suggest Guildwars 2 - smooth/fluid combat, a marketplace thats actually well designed. Oh and yeah, you can actually tweak every detail about your face - nearly - its not as extensive as skyrims character creation, but you can fiddle with enough of the parts manually adjusting enough aspects that your face won't likely be someone else face.",this falls well below standards for the brand name - its so clunky and BAD - i can't even imagine paying a subscription for ...,1484611200,,"{'Edition:': ' FINAL FANTASY XIV Online', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

I bought this second hand and I've recently sold it back via online auction; I'm just glad I got rid of it quickly and still recovered 90% of the price I paid.

This is one of the worst games I played in the last 12 months. I had good expectations; as a Gears of War fanatic, combining 3rd person shooter with Terminators captivated me. But I was profoundly disappointed by the lack of gameplay. I'm one of those gamers who couldn't care less about storyline/plot, I'm all for gameplay. The gameplay here basically involves you jumping from cover to cover and shoot. You do this repeatedly without variation.

But you ask - don't you do this in Gears? Well, not quite, you see in Gears there are intricate level designs, maps and multiplayer options, none of these exist in TS. In TS, you apply the same formula - cover then outflank the enemy and shoot, then regroup with the gang and proceed to the next stage.

What further take this game down several notches are the piss-poor graphics and effects, for example gunfire and explosions effects are just lame; if I played this 10 years ago on the PS1, I would think its cool, but not in 2009 on the Xbox 360! The sound and audio are ok, just. Voice acting isn't great but considering how poorly the rest of the game flares, the voice acting actually stands out.

The boredom is heightened by the fact that there are only 4 enemy types - the spider, aerostats, T-600 and Skin Job (poorly disguised T-600). The AI (on medium difficulty anyway) is fairly poor as well, remember these are supposed to be Terminators.

The weapons you use are the M4, Remington shotgun, RPG, M249 SAW, M79 grenade launcher, M67 grenade, pipe bomb and vehicle-mounted 50 Cal. A decent range of weapons, though nothing really outstanding. I wanted to (but didn't get to) use the SAW. Getting to the SAW on the latter levels (presumably) would incur too much suffering on my part.

Final words - stay away from this game, don't even buy it second hand, if you're curious just rent it. I played this for half an hour tops, got to the third level I think, as I tried to squeeze an achievement out of it before the boredom and the numbness became intolerable and I had to replace it with Winning Eleven 2009. This is only the second time I've quit a game within 30 min (the other was Bullet Witch I recall).

To the developer Evolved Games - This game is far from evolved, in fact it's several steps backwards. I know whenever games are tied to movies, developers are on a schedule to time it with the movie release. A tight schedule is still no excuse for such a poorly made game.","Terminate this game, please!!!!",1244073600,5,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

The only reason it isn't the worst is due to another Conspiracy Entertainment-published (and Data Design-developed) nightmare titled Ninjabread Man, truly one of the worst games ever published on any platform (which incidentally is nearly a carbon copy of this game, same engine, same music, same godawful controls, you get the picture). How this game was ever given the go-ahead is beyond me. The visuals are dismal, the music and sound effects are poor and mind-gratingly repetitive and the controls, if you want to call them that, surpass being merely unresponsive rendering the game largely unplayable. Like Ninjabread Man, there are no production values to see here. Menus are plain, there's no attempt to flesh out any storyline outside of the manual and the music has to be what's playing in the elevators of hell.

I can't stress this enough: AVOID ANUBIS II LIKE THE PLAGUE! Avoid ANYTHING developed by Data Design and take a good long look before you buy anything published by Conspiracy Entertainment. Publishing ""games"" like this is what made the market crash in 1984 and it's currently hurting the Wii software library as shovelware is a dime a dozen.

1.0,False,"08 27, 2016",A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B01CVS3424,Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"Activision has done it again! By that I mean they created something abominable using a license people like so they could trick them out of their hard-earned cash. This time we have a tie-in to the rather controversial Ghostbusters movie that came out in the summer. Hilariously enough, this isn't the first time Activision tried making desperate bank from the Ghostbusters license. Look no further than the Angry Video Game Nerd if you want to know about their initial scam.

Like most of Activisions licensed games, the story takes place after the movie its trying to exploit in the pursuit of money. The heroines of the movie got to be successful and stuff but the narrative focuses on a new cast of Ghostbusters. These can best be summed up as half-baked cartoon characters that have no personality beyond the one trait each person is given. It isn't even as if theres a story beyond whats established, either. The whole point of the game is going around trying to uncover ghosts lurking in areas people hire the Ghostbusters to pluck them out of. Oh, and some overarching plot about the president in trouble thanks to ghost assassins. Too bad the characters are about as appealing as cardboard boxes with air horns.

Oh deary me, the graphics......If it was some sort of Xbox Live or Playstation Network title for $5, it would look slightly tolerable. This is Activision were talking about, though, so of course this had to be a retail game at the full $50 price tag. There is simply no reason why there should be a AAA game entirely played from a top-down view on a console as late as the Playstation freaking 4! Ghostbusters looks like a mediocre Nintendo DS game blown up for the sake of high definition! It doesnt help that the visuals are always so dark and bleak. Sometimes, colors would randomly be thrown around from certain actions, but its otherwise the kind of thing that puts a person to sleep just by looking at it. What is eye-opening, however, is the fact that the games framerate would sometimes briefly stutter every now and then.

Theres nothing more annoying than when video game characters cant ever get themselves to shut up. This holds true with this game. Heres one thing that surprises me: How the crap did they convince musical legend Grant Kirkhope to compose the score for this game?! That is the one saving grace the game has to offer, but I feel bad that he felt the need to put forth more effort than the rest of the crew evidently pulled together. Its just a shame the music is bound to be overshadowed by constant sounds of laser blasts and enemy attacks.

Ghostbusters is a 3D top-down shooter. A very linear, boring, dull, painful one at that. Enemies and bosses all feel the same in every level. In fact, the levels themselves all feel the same. There is nothing to distinguish them from one another other than slightly different-looking scenery. The mechanics themselves are somewhat twin-stick-y, as you can move with the left analog stick and aim with the right. Aside from grenades that stun enemies, there is nothing you can really do to make shooting enemies fun. Theres hardly an incentive to face 85% of the enemies anyway since the only times you have to fight any are when the path is behind a locked door or gate.

I will admit that I did garner a bit of satisfaction when I smacked a ghost against the ground with my stream as I was capturing it. Yet, even that gets old since each and every level (except the first?) feels like slogging through a marathon. They typically, and I mean typically, last from about a half-hour or even longer. The amount of padding in this game is so awful that youd forgive every other game whose padding youve not been fond of.

Its not like theres anything challenging about it, either. At least one of the characters has a feature in which the player could view a line along the ground that tells exactly where to go. It effectively takes the term linear to its most literal level. Even when you do somehow screw up in the gameActually, to come to think of it, theres even flaws with what happens there! You see, this game obviously wants to cater to the multiplayer aspect. If you're not like me and don't want anybody else to suffer this travesty, however, you are stuck with AI teammates.

They at least have better combat skill than the Star Fox crew, but they are also some of the most oblivious AIs Ive ever witnessed when it comes to the player being downed. As long as another players character is beside you and presses the designated button, your health bar is fully healed, kicking away any struggles one may have from monotonous monster mashing. When enemies are still around to be killed, the AI takes that as top priority over your cries for help. They will even be right near you and still not revive you if its focused on killing something.

SighWhy do I keep doing this to myself? Somehow I keep getting surprised every time theres a game with Activisions name on it that turns out to be one of the worst things to be released in the decade. I guess Im thankful that they aren't pumping out as many atrocities as they did last year, but they obviously refuse to learn from their actions anytime soon. Three days after this game came out, Fireforge, the dev team that Activision got to make this Ghostbusters game, went bankrupt. But hey: As the years have shown us, Activision will always find a way to screw people over, whether they be development teams they hire or gullible customers that spend their cash on what they expect to be a decent video game. Until something changes, its going to be hard for non-Skylanders Activision games to receive anything more than a 1/10 from me.","Basically, it's an Activision game",1472256000,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

I'd like to start by stating my brief history with headsets. I've only really ever experienced TurtleBeach headsets, but with music I have used Bose. I owned Bose, the x11's, and the XP300's for a few months. I love the Bose and 11's, hated the 300's because they felt like my head was being squeezed even after trying to loosen them, and like the 510's. For 15 days before I bought the 500's and tried them but the interference was awful, plus they didn't have built in rechargeable batteries.

I contacted turtle beach about how tight the 300's were and they said this was by design, so I was reluctant to try the 510's. I haven't experienced the same problem however so I kept them. I have experienced two other issues that you should consider before buying these and TB should not be proud of.

Issue 1) Auto Shut-off: These headsets turn off if the source of audio is ""too quiet"". I have these hooked up to my computer via creative's DDL with optical link and blue-tooth. With this sound card any digital hook-up has zero volume control. Instead it sends sound out at one volume that cannot be adjusted, which in my case happens to mean that my music on media player must be set at 10% or higher to keep the audio level ""above the threshold"" for the auto-shut off timer. This is a problem because sometimes my games don't play sound above that threshold, which means I need to keep media player in the background just to keep the headset on. Which is distracting, and no one should ever have to make such compromises on such an expensive piece of equipment. The auto-shut off is non-programmable.

Issue 2) Audio: if you plan on using these for computer, when you're not actively listening to something, the digital processor at the transmitter turns off IMMEDIATELY, and takes seconds to turn back on. This translates to: the first few seconds of any song you play, or any game, audio test, ANYTHING is cut-off because the transmitter simply isn't on. To fix this I must keep music playing in the background at 10% at ALL times if I don't want to experience this. This headset wasn't expressly made for pc, but TB had to know that a $300 headset wouldn't sit at one console in its life cycle.

Remember that to use these for computer you will need something with DDL, and a blue-tooth adapter on the pc.

Programmability: Now on to the rest of the review, the reason I bought this headset was for the programmable microphone. See I play at night on the Xbox a lot, so I have to whisper. Almost all headsets don't pick up on whispers though, so I hoped these could be programmed to. They are, but it's not simple at first glance. Specifically you must turn up not the XBL and BT output volume or even the silencer threshold, but for XBL and even computer games to pick up on your voice you need to boost the equalizer. When you do this you will be able to whisper now. 5 stars

As for the rest of the programming options, I haven't got into that because it's complex and from the looks of it you can do almost anything you want. Very promising potential to adjust it exactly the way you want. N/A stars

Comfort: they don't hurt, unlike the 300's. I have worn them for hours on end without issue. 4 stars

Audio: I'm no audiophile so I can't say much. They work, and do have bass. They seem fine. 4  stars

Blue-tooth: this works on my phone, on my computer, google voice, and so on. Seems to work like a blue-tooth should.  Everything I've tried works and without interference. 5 stars

Wireless: I personally don't experience much issue with the interference on these headphones. Sure occasionally I get static or something here and there but it's never been an issue and some of it is to be expected. I have noticed that it does work better when the left ear cup is closer to the transmitter. 4  stars

Transmitter: I like the stand for the headset, but Issue 2 is a problem for me. I wish there was still a headphone jack for friends. For issue 2 I give it 2 stars, because I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to keep it working right.

Microphone: It's programmable in any way you want, what's not to like? 5 stars

XBL adapter: it works without issue so far, sometimes I accidently bump the button on it with my belly while gaming so watch out for that. 4  stars

Charging cable: it's long and it works, but you can feel it pointing down on your shoulder. Makes me worried that I might wear the connection port out one day from this, 4  stars

Data Cable: it's a little too short, you'll need a laptop or move you xbox to your monitor to use this. 3 stars

Surround Sound: it's not breath taking, but it's nice. Honestly I didn't fiddle with this too much and feel that it could be better. But again, I didn't play with the settings on this speaker positioning enough on this to give it a fair review. So I'll just go with 4 stars for now

Overall I'm happy with the headset. I didn't experience issue 1 while on the Xbox. I haven't used it on the PS3 yet, save for Netflix. While browsing on Netflix the auto-off did kick in, and it's F annoying. However during console gaming and actual streaming I had no issue myself.  I would buy these again, but if someone made the same thing without issue 1 I wouldn't.

sorry for the long review

UPDATE: 6/1/2014

It turns out, these aren't worth it. I'm playing Hitman: Blood Money on the 360 with all the game sounds set to %100 and the power saving feature keeps turning my headset off, so I have to leave my wireless headset plugged into it's charger just so they stay turned on. so everything I said before about it being decent is now debunked because it won't stay on. Turtle Beach screwed up, anyone who tried this for an hour on a handful of games could have quickly spotted this before releasing the product. The device is properly setup, i am 100% sure it is not an error on my end.

just wanted to add that i recently tried the elite 800's, and for the money it's a terrible buy. turtlebeach is now on my blacklist and i suggest you never buy without a return policy in mind. then when you do, if it even slightly bothers you or something you don't return it without question. they seem to be develiping a trend of products that have alot of flaws that any ordinary person would hate for the price.",Updated: should read,1393804800,29,,

What on Earth where 2k thinking of changing that for what they have put in here? It's botched the fun of multiplayer up and made it irritating rather than fun. What moron at THQ came up with the idea? Or was it a group desicion? Fire them all, they don't deserve payment for their contribution to numbskull desicion of the year.

If you can find it cheap, good--but I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this... item.  I'm a huge Conan fan (the movies and books) but this game was a let down.

Graphics/Sound: The graphics are slick, clean, and fun to watch.  There is a lot of gore and fantasy violence, so kids beware.  The music is great: high-fantasy, orchestra-inspired Conan stock music.  Sound effects are appropriate, satisfying, and balance with the music.

Controls: the controls were easy to learn but challenging to master.  There are many, many types of moves you can do with different combinations of buttons.  The controls were responsive.

Gameplay: this is the area where Conan falls apart.  You earn points to learn skills and new moves (great mechanic, works fine) and you get to beat up the bad guys with your new moves.  So far, so good.

However, you have absolutely no option about quest, mission, location--nada.  Strike one (for me)--there's not even any special, secret areas to explore!  You can't decide to wander off the beaten path, not even to take a different way to the goal: it's all lead-you-by-the-nose linear gameplay.

Strike two: fighting the boss enemies is repetitious, tedious, and frustrating.  You cannot defeat a boss with any of the cool new moves you learn in the game; you can only defeat them by knocking down their health and then doing some combination of buttons as a cinematic plays.  If you mess up, the boss gets half their life back and you rinse-repeat until you don't miss a single button during the movie.

Strike three (OUT!): I finished the game on normal difficulty in just under 8 hours.  I explored every building, tower, path, and cranny I could find; I died about 40 times.  It still only took me 8 hours.  If you're a hardcore gamer then don't expect much more than that!

Having said that, Andromeda is such an utter disappointment in both of those regards I can't help but give it a non recommendation.

One of the ear cups on my XP500 Turtle Beaches broke off and it was done for. That model was great, and I never ran into any problems with it. While going to buy another pair, I noticed that there was anew model (XP SEVEN) and decided to buy it. This product DOES NOT WORK straight out of the box and is not an easy set up. Turtle Beach DOES NOT mention in the instructions that all the speakers in the headset are turned down. What you have to do, is manually turn up all 4 speakers on the mix-amp provided. After that, you turn up the master volume.

Now, this doesn't sound that big of a problem right? Well, on my pair IT WAS STILL TOO QUIET. The audio also cuts/drops out when there is faint sounds (This was the only thing I fixed on the headset. Reviewer one had great info on this, but it didn't help fix the product). Extremely frustrated, I did more research. I eventually got to the point of having to download WinRar, going to Turtle Beach's website, downloading the Advanced Sound Editor, opening it with WinRar (Because it's the only way to open it), Installing it, and tried to increase the volume. The Sound Editor improved the sound a little bit, but the sound quality sounded muffled.

You are a computerized entity capable of ""hacking"" into the minds of enemies, controlling them and turning battles in your favor by catching squads of your foes off guard. But, imagine that you can only do this once your host shoots an enemy enough times, is close enough to said enemy, and whose aiming abilities make Shadow the Hedgehog look like Master Chief. Such is the world of the painfully generic MindJack.

Story: D-

To illustrate how important plot is to this game, let me first tell you that MindJack allows players to interrupt your campaign at anytime by ""hacking in."" This means that your quasi-successful run of a level could, in theory, be ruined by some idiot who doesn't know his rear end from his elbow. Before you ask, YES, that is indicative of how urgent this game's ""story"" is. From what I gathered, it's about some super-amazing secret agent assigned to escort some woman who has some kind of special ability and a passing resemblance to a loved one, and he's supposed to do... something. Honestly, I stopped paying attention, because the voice acting and dialogue was so pathetic that I stared at the ceiling to keep myself from getting bored. Yes, my dull white ceiling was more engaging than this game's plot.

Gameplay: D

This game is a perfect example of how a brilliant concept can fail miserably if executed wrong. And trust me, it can't get much more wrong than this. The bland, last generation gameplay might be forgivable if FeelPlus had taken the game's main concept a little more seriously and turned it into a compelling element of battle. Instead, they turn it into a sluggish hassle that gives you little motivation to use it, which isn't good considered it's technically the only way to survive throughout the game. Other small things, such as your character walking at a snail's pace outside of battle, and the camera shifting down to the ground whenever you pick up a weapon, become nuisances which further mar what could've been such a great experience. And I refuse to comment on the slapped-on level system, simply because it seems to serve barely any purpose.

Graphics/Sound: They're Bad

Normally, I split the graphics and sound into two more sections and give them their respective grades. In this case, however, I'm willing to make an exception and just be honest: these are both the most laughable aspects of the game. Bland graphics with jagged edges galore are accompanied by the most generic soundtrack this side of a Saturday Night SyFy Original Movie. Problems are worsened to a further degree by the laughable cutscenes, which have some of the worst voice acting since Resident Evil in 1996. It's really sad that a game like this, with a pretty large company putting it out, can scrape by with such dreadful post-production values. Actually, it's not sad: it's embarrassing. Deeply, trulyembarrassing.

Overall: F+

A cool concept, I will admit. If this had been prepped a little more, we would've had a grade-A game on our hands. Instead, we get a rushed piece of junk that will be in the bargain bin faster than the sound of your controller dropping onto the ground as you fall asleep playing this game. And to answer your question, yes, this game made me fall asleep in the middle of a fire fight. So please. Don't let your post-school or after work gaming session turn into a nap. I strongly urge you to play something better, or even replaying a game that you know like the back of your hand. MindJack is a special kind of horrid; it's painfully familiar and dull, and with today's options in the gaming world, there's no reason to spend 60 bucks, or any amount of money, on something like this.

I was considering creating a second account. As of 11-17-05 my account is cancelled. The New Game, also known as the Starter Kit, is the third version of SWG and it is riddled with bugs and incomplete. It is a far inferior product to its previous versions as well. The NG was released after being kept secret for an unknown period of time and allowing players only a two week notice of it being published. Even less time was devoted to it being tested by sources outside of SOE. Trials of Obi Wan and the NG were released in such a manner as to call into question SOE's and LA's ethics. As represented by the employees who post to the forums SOE and LA are uncarring, glib, and/or vastly out of touch with the player community.

Most of these are not new complaints. However, with the release of the NG these problems have escalted to such a degree that the game is no longer playable. While some are content to merely switch games I am not. Simply changing the direction of the flow of money to SOE and LA will not get their attention. I am boycotting all products created by Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts. I encourage others to do the same.

I do not think my actions alone with effect SOE or LA one iota. In fact, I doubt anything will change their policies. The fan base for Star Wars and other properties is sufficiently numerous to mitigate any discontent portion. While some have predicted that the NG will cause the collapse of SWG I believe otherwise. It will lose many current players but those will be replaced by SOE's and LA's new target market. SOE and LA will later use the negative comments and future subscriptions numbers to prove that they were right all along and to dismiss anyone who opposes them as being knee jerk reactionaries who are against change just because they don't like change.

The analog swing is unchanged, letting you control the power and direction of your shot with a back-and-forward motion on the analog stick.
One of the big new additions to Tiger Woods 2004 is the ""game face"" feature that allows you to create your own pro golfer with a rather painstaking level of detail. This player creation mode lets you define virtually every aspect of your player's appearance. For some idea as to how extensive it is, there are 18 different attributes that can be modified in terms of facial structure alone, not including facial hair, eye color, skin tone, and what your golfer's teeth might look like. Truly, the level of character customization offered by the game face feature is unparalleled.

The case is right (except ""Square Enix"" instead of ""Squaresoft""), the manual is right, everything is included and the game, for whatever reason, works, at least on an original US PlayStation console. These are the English version of the games, though I don't know if they will play all the way through, yet--I will update when/if I am able to beat them.

Found some challenge with that until I started a Witch Doctor. You can summon three dogs (that never die) and spam fire bat and walk through the whole game.

I've had Sim City 2000, Sim City 4 Deluxe, recently got back into playing these types of games (Tropico, Port Royal, etc.) couldn't find my disk for Sim City 4, didn't even KNOW a ""new version"" had come out. Saw ads for Cities XXL via ""Steam"" (evidently far superior) but really don't WANT nor see any reason for online/multiplayer interaction for a game like this via a subscription based internet/cloud account and game server. Even the guy at the big box store I purchased this from, when I asked about the ""dedicated internet connection required"" he SWORE that he owned the game himself, and while initially it required the dedicated connection, I could NOW play the game without. NOT TRUE!!!!

TOO anxious for the latest and greatest version of one of my all-time favorite games to research reviews until after I'd purchased, and guess what? ALL the reviews are horrible due to the exact reasons I hate it!

You HAVE to install ""Origin"" (like ""steam"" an online game server app-think of games like Xbox live or Wizard 101) and set up an online account/profile in order to get the game??? I don't WANT to play with other people, I want to build and work on MY city myself, just like in Sim City 4. I want to be able to play even if my internet is down (as would anyone wanting to play the game who doesn't have high speed internet to begin with).

So, I was already angry, but gave in and started jumping through hoops (opting NOT to let Origin run at startup,collect offline data, etc. =the default settings). Loaded everything, clicked on ""Play"" via the Origin ""my games"" tab (internet based), nothing happened AT ALL. I have a Windows 7 pc, Phenom quad core processor, 8 gb ram, 2mb dedicated graphics, high speed internet, NO reason it should'n't have launched. Clicked the ""task manager"" and guess what? The ""Origin"" app itself was hogging over 93 mb of resources, and Sim City (trying to launch) only took 63mb, but COULDN'T launch due to ""Origin"" (or the game servers). This is why every single review of the product says to avoid it at all costs-servers crash, and performance is hindered because of being an internet based game.

I finally got it to launch after a few attempts, then, after nearly a half an hour of 'updating', a few restarts, it finally worked! Well, since the game is internet based and they do a test to adjust your settings, I pretty much ended up having the same graphics I had with Sim City 4, albeit *slightly* smoother and no more funky, intertwined roads. Doing the tutorial, I did discover that you apparently no longer need to do all the manual placement of underground water or power lines, which is a plus, I guess?

While I've just started playing, but due to the game lag, and my graphics quality all 'automatically adjusted' to ""LOW"" by Origin (thus giving me the same graphics Sim City 4 had, or at least only very slightly better) while I've been anxiously looking forward to playing, I gave up halfway through the tutorial. I know that's not fair, but it's true. This will be uninstalled and go in the ""forget"" pile (Like Port Royale 3 did) and I'll dig out my version of Sim CIty 4 again.","MUST install ""Origin"" (Internet game server software) settings adjusted for online play- NOT a ""standalone"" game.",1426982400,4,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Third there is this retarded, repetitive, poorly written abortion.

The most disturbing thing about this game is the number of people that LIKED it!  It has been a trend lately of just...releasing a game.  Do the people making these games even communicate?  Who writes the story?

On this game I'm going to go ahead and guess that a 40 year old sweaty guy with the greasy hair and beard of an Apple product-user (you know the people I'm talking about) sat in his mom's basement and wrote this crap on a MAC.  Actually...I think a MAC is about the only thing that could manage to be as useless as this game.

What the frick is the storyline?  I am a sharp guy...I get things with relative ease.  This story was mung!  Mung is more interesting to study than this game!  I'd actually rather go out and poke poop with a stick than play this game.  I stopped playing to go out and mow my lawn and the grass wasn't even that tall.

Also, you probably think you're going to get to study crime scene evidence and hunt down clues in order to find a serial killer, right?

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  FOOLED YOU!  There are little glowing pictures of fingerprints or shoe prints or evidence.  You then pull out your ""scanner"" or whatever other make-believe tool you could think of for a Men In Black movie and then point at the ""evidence"".  Then, the voice of a woman comes over your headset and tells you what the evidence is.  I don't even get to put the evidence into context for myself!?  This part of the game seemed like something that was added at the last minute.  It's almost as if someone bothered to play the game before release and then went to their boss and said, ""Dude...this thing plays like a first person Double Dragon...except that it sucks.

The voice acting didn't have the best voices, and the characters were either so subtly played or over the top that they didn't have the same feel. Locke was an insufferably annoying philosopher, spouting of fortune cookie quotes about you and the island, and providing little real help. Kate and Jack were tolerable, but so ephemeral that the might as well have not been present. No other Lostie was present, and the camp was so small as to hold maybe 20 people, not the 50 that are really cast.

The gameplay consisted of glaringly obvious puzzles and tracking through the jungle for 30 minute stretchs: 5 minutes of walking and 25 minutes of waiting for the black smoke monster to leave. This alternated with 2 minute mazes where your torch or lantern was your essential life bar.

The flashbacks did much to make up for it, and had a good feel. But nothing could detract from the shear awfulness.

The game controls are great arcadey fun, and deep counter system is implemented well, and as well has a great roster of characters.
The main reason you should stay away from this game is the load times.
Upon starting the game it has a memory cache' that take 5-10 mins just to get to the main menu.
This happens every time you play the game. Lets say you play WWE All Stars, quit and watch a movie listen to music or do anything else and go back, the game will cache memory again. You will not be able to just quickly jump into a match to kill 10-15 minutes, it takes 10-15 minutes before you even see gameplay. Its to the point that you wouldn't even want to play it, because you can actually play another game in the time it takes to load WWE ALL STARS.
There are load times between just picking you character in various modes, a load time before and after the entrances. There are load times everywhere, the load times are ridiculous.
If you plan on playing the game with some buddies later, you will have to plan ahead like 30 mins before any of your friends come over. I cannot recommend the game. The loading times in this game is the worst I've ever seen in the current generation. The load times will bore you to tears. Also the developers won't allow you to even install the game to cut down on the loading times via patch or update. I even wrote to THQ on whether or not they are working on it, and they say its by-design. By-design means they released a game that cannot be fixed. You will spend more time watching a loading screen than actually playing. You controller will go to sleep and disconnect because of the loading times. I have other fighting games MK9 SSF4 Tekken etc, with graphics just as good or better than WWE All Stars and those games loading times are nothing. You can almost play and beat arcade mode on SSF4 in the time WWE ALL Stars even gets you to the main menu. This is one of the most fustrating games I played this current gen, to a point where I will not ever buy a game from THQ ever again. This game need a warning label on the game stating: ""your enjoyment of this game will be severly affected by the by-design load times. THQ Releases games that are incomplete.""

The only enjoyment I really had with the game is Me and my buddies had a drinking game. You take a drink every time a load screen comes on and/or when a loading screen changes with in a loading screen.

1.0,False,"12 11, 2009",A1G337CKP447FX,B0016C3260,Dwayne J,"Why do people like Valkyria Chronicles? I really don't understand it. There's nothing innovative about the game, and the non-innovative things aren't very well-executed either. Quite frankly, I don't think there's anything good about this game.

GRAPHICS AND ART STYLE

The graphics are very technically well done. As someone who has dabbled in computer graphics, I know how difficult real-time non-photorealistic rendering.

And yet, all this fine technology is wasted on the bland, unimaginative art style of Valkyria Chronicles. The character designs? Repetitive and monotonous. The tanks? Plain and boring. The landscapes? What landscapes? (Seriously.)

MUSIC AND VOICE ACTIING

The music sucks. None of the tunes are particularly catchy. None of the battle music gets my blood going. None of the cinematic music gets to me. The only memorable song in the game is the Title theme. And that's only because I hear it every time I turn on the game. Also, whoever thought it was a good idea to do the your turn your music, my turn my music thing should be fired and blacklisted from working in any job in any creative industry.

And the English voice acting is horrible. Now, I generally have a pretty high tolerance for bad voice acting. I mean, I've seen a lot of dubbed anime, and I didn't mind the English voices. To insist on the original Japanese voices is a rarity for me. But the English voice acting in this game was so bad that I went and changed the voice-overs to Japanese. That's how bad it was.

STORYLINE

Utterly boring. Now, in general, I have nothing against long cutscenes. But only as long as those cutscenes are interesting and relevant. Valkyria Chronicle's cutscenes were so boring, I'm pretty sure you could cut 45 minutes for every hour of cutscenes, and not only would the story be more entertaining, but you'd still have a coherent story with a beginning, middle, end, and fully developed plot (if it could be called that). At least the writers had good sense to make some of the cutscenes optional. With one notable exception (which had NOTHING to do with the plot), they were the most boring cutscenes of all.

Now some of you might cite character development as a reason why the cutscenes are so long and uneventful. Well, I'm sorry, but having one character constantly talk about his love of nature for a few hours while another talks about how she loves baking bread hardly counts as character development. (No, more like filler.)

Others of you might claim that the long and uneventful cutscenes were an attempts to show what kind of emotional trials the characters are going through. Except they failed to realize that emotional scenes (which, to be honest, weren't very emotional) about characters that the audience doesn't give a flying fish about will merely bore the audience to death. The writers assumed that we cared about the characters. It doesn't work like that. You need to give us a reason to care about these characters, THEN show us the emotional trials of those characters.

And the plot twists. The plot twists were all so predictable. With one notable exception (which also had nothing to do with the plot), every plot twist in the game was heavily foreshadowed. As a result, when the shocking plot tiwst happened, they had little (if any) impact. That and, shocking plot twists generally aren't a very good form of storytelling. (Consider M Night Shyamalan.)

GAMEPLAY

Now, the meat of the review. The hype mill has been telling people how innovative Valkyria Chronicles is and how well designed the game mechanics are. What game mechanics? Everything Valkyria Chronicles offers either has already been done to death by other Strategy RPGs or adds nothing to the game or is just poorly executed.

The battles aren't strategic at all. When building your squad, there's no customization and no variety. Instead of using strategy to fight your battles, either it's a simple case of shoot anything that moves or it's a case of trying to figure out which hoops the game wants you to jump through in order to clear the mission. Not only that, but the gameplay is grossly unbalanced. The only reason why some of these battles are even winnable is because the player goes first and because the opponent AI is an idiot. Seriously, I've been in multiple situations where the computer opponent has the game in the bag, but instead of winning, they either retreat for no reason or they charge straight at my tank and/or shocktroopers and get themselves killed.

And to make up for this horrible horrible AI, the game designers decided to let the computer opponent cheat. Basically, they get access to much better stuff than the player, they get to start with much more material on the board and better board position, and they get an unending supply of reinforcements.

Not only that, but how could they claim to be a strategy game when something as simple as looking at the board is so obfuscated. The overhead map is all but useless. If you really want to navigate the battlefield, you'll have to use the mini-map in 3rd person mode instead (which often, but not always, contains better information than the overhead map). So you inevitably end up wasting the first few actions trying to figure out what exactly is going on on the battlefield. (Which doesn't matter anyway, since on the ""hard"" missions, you'll end up restarting a few times while figuring out what hoops the game wants you to jump through.) Some people will say that this is to give the game a bit of realism, since you rarely have complete battlefield information. Well, there's already a tried-and-true gameplay mechanic that simulates this. (And it's even named after the actual military term for imperfect battlefield information.) It's called Fog of War. If you're gonna re-invent the wheel, at least make sure it rolls.

Other people will claim that these crappy maps help immerse the player in the role of the commanding officer, where they make decisions based on sketchy maps. And then the game goes ahead and breaks the immersion by allowing you to zoom into 3rd-person views of any particular soldier anywhere on the map. (And I'm not even gonna mention the whole ""Book Mode"" fiasco.)

And every now and then, the game will insta-kill you for no real reason, which makes the game frustratingly unforgiving. Sometimes, it's because you made just the slightest mistake. (Like you positioned your tank slightly off center so that an enemy lancer could make a lucky shot from halfway across the map and blow up your tank, causing you to instantly fail the mission. And by Murphy's Law, if it can happen, it will.) Others, it's not because of any mistake you make, but rather because the game never told you that the enemy can do that. (Like when the enemy's armored train that is equipped with a powerful machine gun that can shoot you from halfway across the map is ALSO equipped with a heavy anti-tank cannon, which insta-kills your tank, causing you to instantly fail the mission.) And sometimes, it's because the game is just plain unbalanced. (Like when the enemy has an anti-tank cannon that can kill your tank in 3 hits, and in this mission, the developers decided to code the enemy to shoot your tank with it 3 times in a row even though normally the AI is dumb enough to NOT do that, causing you to instantly fail the mission.) Fortunately, being able to save during battle mitigates this problem, but that also opens up a completely different set of exploits.

The game also puts undue weight on clearing missions quickly, so much so that even fans of the game will tell you that speed is more important than tactics. A STRATEGY game where SPEED is more important than TACTICS. Yeah, sure whatever. And sure, the game will also reward you for blowing up enemy tanks and killing enemy leaders, but the reward for speed-clearing is orders of magnitude higher, and it drops off so quickly that even being a couple of turns too slow will make that reward disappear.

Valkyria Chronicles is so NOT a Strategy RPG that even the game describes itself as an ""active simulation RPG"" instead of a Strategy RPG. And by that, they mean it's a turn-based 3rd-person shooter with minor RPG elements.

Beyond the lack of strategy, the game also has serious pacing issues. During battle, it takes a long time for anything to happen. (Punctuated by the fact that the game will often interrupt these slow battles with INSTANT GAME OVERS.) Outside of battle, even though the game takes about 40 hours to complete, the game is so boringly slow that it seems like a short game. (And yet, this gamer was glad it was finally over, because it was just SO AWFULLY BAD.) For some reason, the designers thought it was a good idea to have only 1 battle per chapter, even though some battles are obviously related in the story. (Example: The ""Prologue"", and the first two chapters, which really should have been part of the prologue.) This results in most chapters being completely undeveloped, despite hours and hours of (uneventful) cutscenes, as well as way too few battles in the game for you to have a real game. And then, for no apparent reason, the designers break the 1 battle per chapter rule several times over the course of the game.

Basically, everything the back of the box promised was a lie. ""Elaborate strategic maneuvers""? More like SCOUT RUSH!!! ""Action-packed real-time combat""? More like slow, uneventful combat where the player and the computer opponent take turns moving soldiers one at a time. ""Epic storyline filled with dramatic warfare""? More like long and drawn out storyline filled with repetitive pea-shooters. ""Customize your platoon with 50 characters""? Really, each and every one of these characters is a near perfect clone of one of five different archetypes.

CONCLUSION

Why do people like Valkyria Chronicles? The stunningly beautiful graphics engine is wasted on the unimaginative art style. The music is horrible. The storyline bores me to tears. And the gameplay is frustrating, unbalanced, poorly executed, and just plain not fun.

You know what I think happened? The developers had a nice non-photorealistic rendering engine, and they wanted to build a game around it. They heard people liked RPGs, but they also heard that RPGs had already been done to death. So they sat in a room for a few hours and quickly came up with a few concepts, then whipped up a game as fast as they could, and didn't bother polishing it at all. Then, in order to get the game to sell like hotcakes, they paid game reviewers to rave about this game and hype it up to get people to buy it.

And the PS3 owners, frustrated that all the good RPGs went over to the Xbox 360, decided to buy Valkyria Chronicles and convinced themselves that it was actually good. And half of these people don't know what a ""Strategy RPG"" is, so they think Valkyria Chronicles is actually innovative. And a lot of these people are secretly Shooter fans, and since Valkyria Chronicles has guns, hurray for them!

And THAT is why people like Valkyria Chronicles.

But that still doesn't make Valkyria Chronicles a good game.","Finally, a negative review of Valkyria Chronicles",1260489600,71,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

 Prison Tycoon sounds like a pretty cool concept- Build a prison your way, making it as hard or soft on prisoners as you want while dealing with riots and other cool stuff. But the concept behind this game is where the coolness ends...

Although it's a budget title, The interface and sound outright suck, and the game gets repetative waaaay too quick. The graphics are passable, but in no way compensate for the game's other brutal shortcomings. The game has cool building and customization options, but they are too few and too bland.

That really aught to say it all, but I though I would provide a helpful additional review to those who are willing to risk losing all your previous progress.

Let me start by saying this: If you are going to try to make it through the whole DLC, make about 8 save game copies. You'll need them all and additional luck to beat this DLC. What do I mean? I'm not Bethesda n00b. C'mon, Bethesda practically means game breaking glitch. I had about 4 different save game files when I started Automatron. When I got to the final battle, the game froze forcing me to close the software. I thought ok, this is a short DLC (and it is just as others have stated), I'll start again because this save game is wrecked. Save #2 had the same results. It worked until the final fight, then perma-froze. I almost got through the last time, but it froze none-the-less. I started over again despite being so pissed off that I wanted to sell the game, get a refund from Bethesda, and sell my PS4 (ok not really, but still). Guess what? Save #3 had the exact same result.

As of right now, there is no fix, no work-around, and no solution in sight. I've heard of others with the same problem and it would seem you have about a 50% chance of beating the DLC without encountering this game breaking glitch. You can always just not finish the DLC story, but who wants that? Chances are there may be some future fix, but I approach actually playing this dlc with caution. Assuming you don't actually want to risk it, you can still get a lot of cool stuff from this DLC. Building Robots is awesome.

As the matter of fact there are new uniques, access to a full X-01 suit, and two new locations, but at this point the PS4 release is just too buggy.","Great New Benefits, Awful New Gamebreaking Glitches",1460246400,,"{'Edition:': ' Automatron Add-On', 'Platform:': ' PS4 Digital Code'}",

I had high hopes when I purchased this game 3 days ago...already I'm bored with it. As a fan of FPS, I thought a ""perfect 10"" game would have me coming back for more. Not with this game. The game play was short, 1 dimensional, and lacking a multiplayer that would rival Halo2. I'm sorry, but for a FPS game (not games like Oblivion, which in my opinion is a far superior game) to NOT have a multiplayer or have serious flaws with their multiplayer (ala Gears of War) is a HUGE factor is rating the game. Since Bioshock doesn't have multiplayer, I took it down 2 stars.

The most annoying aspect of this game is when you play it on hard level. It takes a thousand shots to kill a regular enemy. It takes a million shots to kill a Big Daddy. This normally wouldn't be a problem, if it was easy to accumulate ammo.  Unfortunately for a FPS game, you spend the entire time searching dead bodies and crates looking for ammo or money to buy ammo instead of actually enjoying the shooting aspect of everything. Some will chalk to this up to ""amazing game play features"" but its retarded. Its a FPS game, not a role playing game. What a waste of time.

The same can be said for the powers that you use. You basically get to use your ""adam"" powers twice before you've drained it, THEN you gotta scrounge around even more to find ""eve"" (which refills your adam powers) or money to buy eve. Another huge waste of time.

BioShock would have been astute to have the Eve recharge on its own, so you can enjoy using your powers instead of rarely using them so you don't accidentally waste them.

Also, I played the game on hard and beat it quite easily. I found the Big Daddy's to be a lot harder than the final battle with Fontaine (the boss). He was so easy that it was laughable. What a lackluster ending.

For anybody who has played the original Final Fantasy Tactics on the PSONE loved it (seriously loved it) I implore you, do not buy this game! Of all the negative reviews out there bashing the games flaws(the lag on spells, the useless new job classess, etc.) nobody is saying what REALLY needs to be said. And that is as follows...

Squenix ruined this game when they increased the amount of JP necessary to gain skills and go up joblevels.

For anybody who played the original we all known how hard the game could be and how very necessary it was to spend a good portion of your time developing and training your characters. The game can be quite time consuming in this one aspect, albeit, but it was quite fun and very satisfying (not a word I use often) to see the pay off in characters that could dish out the damage and hold their own in tough situations. Your own A-team, so to speak. The demand for more JP utterly KILLS! this experience.

Take for instance the Lancer's jump abilities. The level 8 jumps only required 900JP to master. Now they require 1500! and thats just one example. In Final Fantasy Tactics, the higher a characters job level the more JP they could aquire. Simultaneously increasing JP required for leveling a character's job level AND gaining skills makes it even more time consuming. It increases exponetially the amount of time needed to level your characters. If feels like you're getting corn-holed from both ends. You can't gain as much JP AND more JP are required to gain skills. AGGH!

For instance, I always like to get Ramza the Ninja's two-swords ability before his one on one duel with Gafgarion. In this way he can use sword break two times in one turn and turn Gafgarion's game completely on it's head. With the PSP version of the game, however, it probably would have taken far too much time to develop Ramza that far. I sold the game after I beat chapter one after realizing getting to this point would require hours, and hours of training while my eyeballs slowly fell out of my skull after staring down at that tiny little screen for so long. Wander around, enter a battle, ingnore the monsters and start doing all the thing us veterans do to gain JP like the Squire's Accumulate, only however much time you spend leveling your characters in the PSONE version, times that by 2.5 and you have a rough estimate of how much you'll playing (and feeling like a nerd with no life!)

I am terribly dissapointed with this game! There is Oh, so much Square enix (or Squenix) could have done to make this better! Giving access to jobs only the bosses had, such as Arc Knight, Sorcorer, Assassin, and many others. Elmdor's Teleport 2 ability, better weapons, better jobs, more missions...

The maps are poorly designed, with too few to keep it interesting.  The bulk of the maps available are largely ignored by the online community because they are simply terrible.  Other problems plague this game, like map exploits, equipment exploits, and hackers.  All of which succeed in robbing this game of the few aspects that actually make it fun from time to time.  Tanks and armored vehicles are grossly under protected, forcing many who use them to camp from distances.  Jets are too few and are spawn points, so one player can simply respawn directly into one, and hog it all game.  Heat seekers, and other weapons add some defense, but skilled pilots can easily deflect them and keep on rampaging without much to stop them.  Overall the game tries to keep the awesome infantry combat of BC2, with the vehicle variety of BF2, and it's just not balanced.

The map pack adds a single useful map, the rest are ignored by most of the servers out there.  In conclusion this game feels rushed, and incomplete.  Marching halfway across a giant map, only to be single shotted by a pistol to the head will kill the fun for anyone.  Which is pretty much this game has to offer,  long loading times, horrible online interface, having to deal with Origin (a horrible service IMHO), and long bouts of running, and quick deaths.

Right now I finally got it to reinstall on the 5th try in the past 24 hours but its still not a perfect install. What prompted this was the executable just quit working suddeningly. This issue is well documented at the CodeMasters Forum site and other sites on the web. Now that I've got it installed the resolution is stuck at 800 x 600 with no way to change it in the graphic settings. Frame rate no longer shows up in graphic settings either.

Its as though my display options have been limited by the DRM to that of a DEMO game when I actually bought the full blown game new! My native resolution is 1920 x 1080 and I have played the game previously at that resolution with no problems. So the fact that it is stuck in 800 x 600 makes this game unplayable for me cause 800 x 600 is real ugly by comparison. All my other games work flawlessly at 1920 x 1080.

1.0,False,"10 12, 2008",A33I2QV713UCT5,B000FKBCX4,RAF,"Two years ago, when I looked at this game, I thought it would be a decent, fun game, and it would be worth paying 50 dollars for. Unfortunately, it isn't decent, it isn't fun, and it's really not even paying 10 bucks for. That's how bad it is. To sum up what this game is, it's just a bunch of depthless minigames that take about thirty minutes each to beat, until, that is, you get to the space stage. The first phase, cell phase, is the only semi-fun one; of course, it's probably the most dumbed down of all phases. This phase only takes a few minutes to beat. The creature phase can take a long time depending on whether you befriend or attack everything. This phase is aggravating and boring.

The tribal phase is so easy that it can only take you around 20 minutes to beat. In this phase, you're pretty much forced to ally with the other tribes, as using warfare takes forever and gets you nowhere. Once you get past the tribal phase, it's time for the civilization phase, which is more or less the same as the tribal phase, only it's a lot easier to kill everyone. In this phase, your people develope so quickly it's unrealistic; they get vehicles right after the tribal phase, and soon after develope ships and warplanes. Ultimately, this phase is the second most frustrating.

The space phase is the last and worst phase. If you don't ally with at least one major empire, you're screwed, for lack of a better word. Of course, you're forced to go stop ecodisasters and stop pirates, and for whatever reason, they can't do it themselves. The best items cost a ridiculous amount of sporebucks(the currency in spore), and it can take hours to get enough money just to get the planet buster, and you can only use it once before you buy another one.

After a while, you'll get used to killing pirates and stopping ecodisasters and defeating the Grox(the cheesy, borg-like rat-villains of the game). Your main goal, later on, is to get to the center of the universe. You'll find that most of the races in the universe sound the same, and that some even look the same; that being said, it makes it feel like there's no variety in races, which, there isn't much of. It's almost painful to reach the center of the universe. You have to not only defeat the Grox, but you have to beat the other hostile empires. This took me around 4 days for me to do, and that was to only get near the center of the universe. That's 4 days wasted.

To sum it all up, this game is a dumbed-down, boring piece of trash that was so overhyped that, in order to avoid a tide of hate mail, places like Gamespot gave it a positive review to save their butts.

I beg fellow gamers to either not buy this game, or pirate it. The game is not worth 50, or even 10 dollars, and the fact that there's a draconian DRM attached makes it even worse; you can only install the game 3 times on a computer. That means that if your computer loses all of its data 3 times, or you want to install it on 3 computers, you'll have to call EA customer support in order to get an extra install. EA games treats its customers like criminals. They've tightened their grip so much that this game is becoming the most pirated game of all time. I'd bet if NASA knew that this game would be THIS bad, they wouldn't shown it.

I say it again: Do not buy this game. Don't waste your time, money, or sanity trying to play or buy this game, and if you absolutely must have it, then pirate it. They thoroughly deserve it.

Update:
After charging the Vita for the first time, I noticed that the charging cable fits really tight into the vita, it was difficult to remove, and using this charger makes the vita touch screen stop working when waking the device, you have to unplug the charger and reboot the system.

Further Update: The problem with the touch screen not working seems to be due to the adapter, not the cable, when using the cable with an official charger for either the Vita or the PSP Go it works fine, you just have to deal with the extremely tight fitting connector.

1.0,True,"05 28, 2008",AVHWCOWARSC83,B000UQURQ6,Laika,"The third Adventure Company game based on an Agatha Christie novel, Evil Under the Sun is disappointing evidence that this series - never great to begin with - is actually getting worse over time.

Puzzles are few and far between, and nearly all of them are simple inventory puzzles. As with the previous games, you just pick up anything the game will allow you to take, and tote it around, ridiculously, until you eventually have need of it. In a couple of cases the game even gives you detailed instructions for how to solve a puzzle. If you think that following instructions (complete with diagrams) is a lot of fun, well, this is the game for you.

Otherwise, you can just sit back and watch Poirot walk around. There is no way to fast-travel between locations, so much of your time will be spent walking. Hopefully you'll find that very entertaining, because the pace of this game is astonishingly slow. The game is composed of eight chapters, and the murder doesn't even occur until chapter five. Until then, most of the ""action"" comes from two new storylines created for the game: a Fifth Columnist hunt (the game takes place during WWII), and a plot about a glowing green ghost that even Scooby Doo would find silly. And don't even think about skipping any dialogue - if you don't painstakingly work your way through the dialogue tree, you're likely to get stuck.

But far and away, my biggest gripe with this game is the ""new ending."" Do not be fooled by this - the murderer is the same as in the novel!  Apparently the ""new"" part comes from the, um, action scene that follows (in cut scene, of course, because heaven forbid the player have to do anything during the climax of the game). The new ending doesn't even make much sense, really, but I was so happy to see the game end that I won't nitpick.

Bottom line: this game is a joyless, plodding exercise that never would have been made if not for the Christie name. Read the book instead. If you're looking for a good detective game, check out the Nancy Drew series. Honestly, you could just watch paint dry and it would still be more fun than this game.",Never again...,1211932800,7,,

I feel the need to add that while I was holding them in the store, my wife WARNED me and I should have listened. She said, ""didn't you have an afterglow controller and HATED it and never used it?"" And I said yes and proceeded to tell her that these headsets had a compair chart on the side of the box with them and turtlebeaches. But honestly, I thought they looked cool.
I got them home and was impressed by the box, as well as impressed by the headphones themselves. Then the sadness came. I have my Xbox hooked up with an hdmi cord so naturally I hooked them up the same way my tbs were hooked up. (Using the adapter I purchased) nothing. Friends texted me saying they could hear me, but I couldn't hear them.
So I tried to hook them up to the tv, I have a tv made past 2009 so naturally it doesn't have a audio out plugs. So my next option, (according to the booklet and a video on YouTube on how to hook it up) was to plug it into the headphone jack on my tv, which is on the back and the cord from the headset is so short on that end, I had to place my Xbox behind the tv.
It WORKED!!!! Yayyy, but wait, now, the game volume on the controller makes the chat volume go up and down as well as the actual game volume, and the chat volume only makes the game volume go down. What the heck is happening, now I only have the option to play with my chat volume very loud AS WELL as the game volume and no other choice. ""Great, this sucks guys....guys? Hello?"" Oh, what a surprise, I touched nothing and they suddenly stopped working. Oh whats this, the mute button is only button with no indication as to weather your muted or not, maybe that's the problem.... Sadly, no. They never worked again.

1.0,False,"08 25, 2015",A3HPSUNSQMXWL7,B00OH5ADQK,Patrick Shields,"Hyperdevotion is by far the worst Neptunia game I've played. The only way I can properly express my displeasure is with a list.

The Leading Ladies: Noire is the main focus this time, which was immediately a red flag since Noire is third best goddess in most games, but the worst in this because it's Ultradimension Noire, which adds an extra layer of pretentious brat on top of the already bland tsundere (shy girl for the uninformed) character. The other goddesses are far more interesting, with my favorites, Blanc and Neptune, saving every scene they're in. They added a male character, but I didn't even remember him until I glazed over another review. I shouldn't even mention him, considering the plot barely changes without him. No candidates though. Take that as you want, but I see it as a negative.

The Supporting Makers: As is usual for the series, the supporting cast is made up of representatives for large gaming companies, stand-outs this time being Final Fantasy and Street Fighter characters. What also stands out is the abhorrent amount of sexual harassment Noire endures. More than half the introduction cut scenes for the characters are her being groped, pinned down, or otherwise molested. The only time I liked this was when she was drugged and about to be turned into a mecha, but that scene would have worked better with her clothes on. And those introductory cut scenes? Those are the only characterization you get for them. Some have cut scenes when you fight them before recruitment, but it's little more than showing the characters visual novel picture. They are all unique in combat, but they needed more character moments to flesh them out.

The Gameplay: Weak characters aside, it can work if the gameplay is fun, right? Yes, it can and for a while it did. Then I started noticing how broken the game is. You have a limited height you can fall without taking damage. Enemies do not. You cannot attack over a ledge unless you use magic. Enemies can. You only stay in HDD for 3 rounds. The enemies stay that way all match. You can only use finishers when you have built up your lily gauge. Enemies spam them every turn without any action that would allude to them even having a lily gauge. With how often you fight future or past party members, it's almost impossible not to notice how unfair the game is, letting enemies break rules that you have to follow. It kills the strategy and forced me at one point to continually quit and select make easier until the finishers did no damage to me, but that I'm saving for the spoiler story section. I enjoyed the gameplay otherwise, with one specific section near the end making you carefully choose what units to use, how and when. Too bad the section before it ruined the experience for it.

The Story of kinda Spoilers: It's Neptunia one. Arfoire tricks Noire out of her power, she has to go around building a party and they fight Airfore at the end. It isn't that simple when annalyzing plot points, but if you look at it as a whole, it's basically a less in-depth version of the original Neptunia plot with Noire as the lead.

Now the Major Spoilers to do With Gameplay: Remember how I said the game was unfair? How enemies could just spam finishers? Well here's the kicker. The game sets you up to either need to grind or exploit the make easier function. Let me explain. In chapter 5ish, Blanc, Vert and Neptune go off to defend their home countries. As you'd expect, things go bad. Vert is mind controlled, Blanc is a zombie and Neptune is patriotic... Yes, it really is as silly as it sounds, but this was a fun mixing up of the gameplay to make things interesting, even though it is when I started to notice how unfair the game was, since Vert is usually useless, but is a god when she can ignore the rules. Then the next chapter is when this game last it's second star. Everyone turns on Noire for basically no reason, so the three remaining goddesses have to save her. The problem, aside from the AI breaking the rules? All three goddesses went the whole last chapter without getting ANY EXP! This was the point where I lost it, because you don't get to back out and recover your party to grind. You either had to grind levels with only three characters or exploit the restart screen to make the game easier. This was some grade F level game design that I'm surprised more people didn't get angry about. This was the last straw and I just dropped the difficulty to clown shoes until I was able to beat every other party member with only three characters. It's a shame, because right after that is a great segment where you have to carefully divide up your party into four groups, being careful not to leave one group weak on magic, movement or melee. It was an inspired set of levels ruined by the fact I was still pissed about the horrible game design one chapter earlier. The last boss was also OP and I did the same thing because I just wanted to be done.

In Short: Don't bother. Get Fire Emblem: Awakening if you like RTS and get any other Neptunia game unless you love Noire and don't mind her being constantly molested. I was close to giving this a two star, since it does have a really good section near the end, but poor story, little characterization and unfair gameplay makes this a game I would rather just forget. I would give it a 3 out of ten, but that isn't an option.","You asked for it. Well, Japan asked for it. When's our Blanc game again?",1440460800,4,,

How can I buy this from Amazon as ""USED"" when a 2 limit install means I will only get a game that won't install for me.  For those of us who like conspiracy theories, we can only assume that install limits are an attempt by game producers to kill the resale potential of their games in the hopes to force additional sales by closing off the used game avenue.  After all, the orignal vendors don't get paid again when their games sell used.  Alternatively we can look at it as a kind of ""planned obsolescence"" designed to send games to the ""dead pool"" quicker in order to fuel a need for new games to be developed.  Digital Rights Management (DRM) and limited installs are two of the worst examples of anit-competativeness around.  Then again, with the blantant theft that occurrs over TORRENTS, can we really blame them or is this the fault of the thiefs among us.  I wonder if there are stats that can tell us what theft is costing the industry.  As one who has never acquired a game via a Torrent, I wonder how big a deal theft really is to the game industry.

My wife got me one of these shortly after my last one (#4) died.  That was in March.  It's now June, and it went out because the button (the left click button of all things) went south on me at a very bad time.  Had my wife not gotten this for me, I'd have been using something else.  I only used it because it's a PITA to re-program a new one, but no more.  Never again.  Even free, (at least for me), it's not going to be replaced.

For everyone else, go ahead and read the rest of the review and decide, but if you want the TL;DR version here, avoid this.  It's great while it lasts, but it has absolutely no durability, and unless they're under ten bucks each, they're absolutely not worth the investment.  I've got other gaming mice earmarked to try when (I knew not ""if"") it died.  The only surprising thing was that the memory wasn't what died.  The buttons went kaput.  That's a first, and frankly, it's the last time I'm ever going to deal with it.

I just wanted to make sure folks know before they buy it that even if it's great at first, it will die faster than you'd expect, from multiple causes and is just not worth the hassle at any price.  Read on and you'll see what I mean.

[EDIT: 2/28/2018]
I've now had 4 of these, in about 3 years.  I bought my first in November of 2014.  It died in August of 2015 and was replaced.  I had a friend buy one for me in the middle of 2016.  That one lasted the longest, but was dead by July 2017 and was replaced by the one that just died in February 2018.  They DO NOT KEEP THEIR MEMORY.  The memory chips in them fail after limited use.  The mouse otherwise works fine.  It's just that their memories are completely unusable for anything once they go.  I can turn off the software and it will revert to their default state, as long as you don't try to load in a profile.  But that completely negates the point to having one of these in the first place.

If you HAVE TO HAVE one of these things, get something else.  Failing that, spring for the extended warranties.  I've NEVER had one of these last more than a year, which, considering the cost and the fact that I have 10 year old mice that still work fine (non-programmable, of course), is inexcusable.

I base my reviews on what I experience.  I do a lot of writing, so the vast majority of my mouse use is for standard mouse work, and I don't NEED a gaming mouse.  But for games, I do.  And this one can't be trusted to ""be there"" for very long.  The rest of the review pretty much stands, when it works.  But, I lowered by review to one star from four because the reliability factor is god-awful, and that plays a major role in my opinions of products.

[END EDIT]

I've had this for a weekend and haven't really found anything to complain about.  In fact, I rather like it.

I've had an OLD Logitech G5 for more than seven years and to say I'm used to it would be like saying I'm used to my right hand.  It still works alright, but it's getting to the point where I may no longer be able to resurrect it.  The pads are worn, the clicker isn't as snappy as it was and occasionally it won't register the click at all - which is kind of annoying.  So I went on the Great American Mouse Hunt.

I was hopeful, but not optimistic.

I am so far from being a casual computer user, you may as well put me in my own dimension.  I am pickier about the quality, feel and function of my computer devices as a French chef with an attitude at an exclusive five star restaurant is about the food he prepares.  The majority of my waking hours are spent on the computer (personal and professional reasons  - relax, I do have a life).  I can pulverize a $20.00 mouse in under four months of MY normal use (which is a combination of gaming, surfing, art, video, programming...  Um, well, everything you can do with a home computer at some point - all in a ten to eighteen hour day of nearly constant use.)

The really awful part was they don't make the G5 anymore - if they did, I would buy about 10 and never have to buy a mouse again - and neither would the grand-kids.

So I knew I'd need a gaming mouse.  I knew it had to be heavy (I like heavy). It had to be big (I have big hands).  It had to be WIRED (I'm FASTER than most wireless devices.  I bought a Logitech wireless keyboard and ended up typing faster than it could record.  Wireless mice? Well, let's just say they never have the juice to keep up and leave it go at that.)

Being a gamer (not obsessive, mind you, but wanting to not look like a noob all the time), I discovered that gaming mice have a far higher durability and the Logitech mice seemed to have an outstanding quality and durability.  So that's where I placed my focus.

The G600 is a very wide mouse compared to the G5, but the odd thing is that the extra clicker isn't in my way at all.  Because the mouse is programmable, that click can be set to any function.  So I programmed it for something useful in a game, but not annoying when ""out and about"" and accidentally hitting it.

Other controls seem to be intelligently built - especially the buttons.  You never DON'T know where your thumb is.  I can reach the first nine rows without too much trouble (I have flexible thumbs) and just left the last row (the one closest to the palm) on their default numerical settings.

I work with a game pad when playing games (and since this is a gaming mouse, will focus on its performance in that regard) and reprogrammed EVERYTHING to accommodate a more integrated playing style.  The good news is that I didn't get my character killed.  The bad news is that I've got a LOT of bad habits to break with regard to realizing that function X isn't on the gamepad anymore, it's on the mouse.

Knowing, as I do, that it's only a matter of getting used to things, it's not a major issue.  The ability to find the button to press is a plus, but occasionally I do ""over grip"" and press the wrong one.  Big hands, big fingers, exciting games will do that.  The plus is that it actually takes more than a casual bump to click the button, so this isn't often an issue.

Its movement on the pad (I recommend a good game pad using it) is VERY smooth - even more so than my G5.  This facilitates NOT pressing the buttons at the wrong times when moving the mouse to the right.

In the adjustment phase, the game pad had to have the profile saved and uploaded to the device.  With the mouse, it was change and forget (I use the older Belkin n52te, even though I do have one of the new Logitech pads which offers the same change and forget feature.  I prefer the ergonomics of the Belkin).  The changes were applied instantly.  When you're trying to adjust between massive waves of foes switching from full screen game to editing device settings and back again, that instant feature is pretty nice.

The mouse fits in my (admittedly large) hand VERY comfortably, and I'm finding the use of the gaming controls on it to be more intuitive as I tweak things to fit my ingrained style versus the learning curve.  Once I get more used to it, I expect it to be as natural of a fit as my G5.

My only real concern is the durability of the thing (as it is with most things I review almost ""out of the box"").  I can never give anything 5 stars until I KNOW it's worthy of that accolade and with mice, especially, I have a major gripe about durability.  Hence why those products that have potential durability issues are given a maximum of four stars until they've proven themselves.

So far, my only real concern is that the more something can do, the more potential points of failure there are.  This thing does a lot.  The potential to run the entire game through one hand is high, if you have really nimble fingers and really fast reflexes.  It's a bit of an overkill, IMHO, but it could do it.

Still, it's a lot that could go wrong and these are newer models of mice from Logitech.  I don't really go for ""brand loyalty"", but when it comes to performance and durability, I've had the best luck with Logitech, so I'm taking a chance that their gaming mice are going to be about as durable (if not better) as the G5 was for me.

It's working at least as well as the G5 did for me when it was new.  Latency was minimal (I didn't notice any), clicking speeds were excellent and accurate, it has enough drag to know you're moving it without so much that you accidentally press the wrong button (unless you're almost dying and trying to remember which button was your healing skill)  My only trouble with it is using it's on-board buttons, which I'll get used to.  Failing that, I can always go back to just using it like a G5 mouse, reset my game pad and be back doing things like I did before.

It's got all the accuracy, speed, DPI and laser tech that were the reasons I got the G5 in the first place.  So in most respects, provided it holds up, it's got the potential to be a 5 star winner from me.","It's not reliable, even if it's awesome while it works",1415577600,,"{'Color:': ' Black', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",

I have always been a PC gamer and have stuck with it through the hardest of times both for me and for PC gaming itself. I enjoyed Borderlands 2, I thought it had some enjoyable coop but I quickly realized how the majority of fun came from the fact that I was playing with friends, not necessarily the game play.

This is not to say Borderlands 1 or 2 are bad games, they do what they set out to do well, and because of that I had faith that Gearbox would deliver at least a semi-decent product, but this game is one of the most shameful displays of a 2013 entertainment product that we will likely see all year. I actually went into this game expecting it to not be that great and I was still completely and utterly let down. I am also a pretty big Left 4 Dead fan and have 500 hours between both games clocked on my Steam account, Aliens Colonial Marines takes a few pages from L4D and shoves them into a lifeless, shell of a game.

There is not one single little detail that this game does better than anything else, and I say that with zero troll-ness in my heart, I say this because I really do not want people to waste their money like I did. I am a sucker. I fell for the marketing and the nostalgia brought on by my childhood. I should have realized that the embargo on reviews meant they knew it was bad, I should have listened to my gut when I first saw game play footage and the animations looked like something that came out before Doom 3. My friend and I are most of the way through the campaign right now and I had to quit because it was so mind-numbingly dull and repetitive. I will go back one last time to beat the campaign because I spent $50 on this ""game"", but I will never play it again after that, I will never pre-order another game and the chances of me buying another Gearbox title are pretty much slim to nil.

This game is advertised as ""Works great on Xbox 360"" on the packaging, which we thought meant it was updated to actually work on the X360.  But No. It does NOT work great on Xbox 360.  Yes, it technically opens and runs using the original xbox emulator built-in to the x360 (which REQUIRES a hard drive installed in your x360 if you didn't know).  But Misleadingly, this game still uses the old original (discontinued) Xbox Live, and thus no online multiplayer at all whatsoever?!

Come to find this out the hard way;
1. Microsoft Xbox Live is the OLD discontinued online mulitplayer from original Xbox that is offline forever.
2. Microsoft Xbox Live Gold is the CURRENT online multiplayer network for Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

NOTE: To confirm, even logged into the X360 with active Xbox Live Gold account, this game gives a error about being unable to connect online to Xbox Live (even though all our other Xbox Live games work great online).  After looking up the error code online, we discovered if we had an old Original Xbox hardware, this game STILL WOULD NOT WORK ONLINE AT ALL WHATSOEVER.

Bottom line:  No online multi-player whatsoever means in our humble opinion, ""Work great on Xbox 360"" as advertised on the packaging is not 100% truthful, and in fact, we outright feel tricked by this misleading game packaging's marketing.

With titles like the excellent 3D platforming adventure Pac-Man World 2 and the fun multiplayer experience that is Pac-Man Vs. under the dot-muncher's sleeves, not to mention a Namco Museum containing Arrangement games.

So why the heck did Namco allow this to be placed onto store shelves? Trust me when I say that the opening FMV video to the game was the best thing about it. Once you get that out of the way, you're thrown into a swarm of low-budget-ness, complete with Comic Sans font seen in menus and other bland screens. This includes the game itself, which is just a board game video game as a way to hop aboard the Mario Party train. Only problem: This is way worse than every Mario Party there is.

The game lets you pick one of THREE boards. Yes. Only three. Even worse, they are boards that you just race from start to finish on. I thought it'd be alright though, since a brief game could still be fun. However, they managed to make these boards DRAG. I could have sworn I was supposed to finish up my game like an hour or so prior. Instead, this is as slow as a snail's pace.
There are no dice blocks. Instead, the minigames actually start at the beginning of every turn. How far you move depends on how well you ranked in the minigame. Unfortunately, the minigames suffer from feeling like being made under a low budget, and were nowhere as fun as Mario Party minigames. Everything felt so static and soulless, especially in minigames where you drive a kart or throw darts/""discs"".

As a player walks across the board's spaces, there's no telling what BS could happen. There are Spring spaces (bounce player forward), Return spaces (opposite), spaces where a bunch of a player's coins could be taken away or earned easily. and Store spaces where players could spend on cheapness such as moving forward or SENDING OTHER PLAYERS BACK SPACES. Yeah, that's pretty fair, am I right?

With all that said, my first and so far only playthrough on one of the boards was dreadful. There were so many times where I couldn't land on a Store space, and I haven't even landed on a Spring space, yet the CPUs had several times. The fact that I won was nothing short of a miracle

I would have given this 2 stars, but the thing is - I never had fun with it.

Be warned, the computer always wins every single mini game. There's a choice for computer skill...easy, normal, or hard...huh? What is hard skill?

But, it does not matter, Ive tried all three settings multiple times and it makes no difference in the computer's amazing flawless skill at mastering the game.

Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Mech Warrior 4 is a fun game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation.

Pros
1)Its wireless
2) Low price on amazon.

Cons
1) Its not responsive. You may have to press buttons 2 or 3 times before the signal actually goes in. It isn't lag free like it says.
2) Joysticks are way to sensitive. For example if your are in a racing game, barely turning the analog stick will cause you to do a sharp turn
3) Its motion sensing feature is a gimmick. It sounds good on paper, but does not work in reality. You'll barely turn or not a all no matter how much you move around the controller.
4) It is very small. Doesn't fit adult hands.

The dual shock 2 blows this controller out of the water. This is expected as 3rd party products are usually garbage. I highly recommend you pass on this product.

Why? How hard could it be to screw up a game franchise that was so successful? Just make the same game but improve the graphics. Why was that so hard? Why did this game fail so terribly?

Well, lets itemize what makes a great SWBF game and see where this miserable failure fell short:
1. Evolution: Does it hold up to and improve upon its predecessor?
2. Story - for folks who like to have a reason for going pew! pew!boom! instead of violence for the sake of it.
3. Authenticity: does it look and feel like Star Wars? Am I immersed in the setting?
4. Controls: are they intuitive?
5. Diversity: do I feel like I'm really a rebel/imperial/hero character/pilot?

Evolution:
Once upon a time, there was SW Battlefront II. It was awesome. It had an engaging story mode that told us the imperial side of the star wars story through the 501st Storm Trooper battalion. Voice acting and plot were solid. It had multi-player match making, galactic conquest, and multiple character classes---some ubiquitous, others unique to that army's faction. Vehicle controls seamlessly matched regular controls. Space battles were epic. Hero characters were highly effective.

This game has none of that. They removed everything good about the prequel and didn't bother replacing it with ANYTHING.

Story:
There is none. I'm not criticizing an existing story. They didn't even bother to make one. Wow. There are so many star wars books out there they could have borrowed material from anywhere but they just didn't

Authenticity:
I'll give this oozing lump of putrid mucous one thing: its a very shiny lump of putrid mucous. The graphics are beautiful and when I played I genuinely felt a part of the Star Wars universe, so A for effort here.

Controls: Just.... no. Its bad enough when you're trying to figure it out alone but when you're in a pitched battle? Forget it. Discover as you go. No tutorial. No story mode so you can get accustomed to the controls. No learning curve. Just a steep cliff. The controls for vehicles are a mess, assuming you even had time to figure them out before getting shot down or crashing unintentionally. And what's worse is vehicle controls are utterly alien compared to the foot soldier controls. They should be AT LEAST comparable.

Diversity:
a.) Foot Soldiers: One of the best things about SW BF 2 was the diversity of unit types. Engineers, foot soldiers, scouts, and heavy weapons troops could be chosen in any of the 4 factions, but their play styles differed enough to make them seem genuinely diverse. Battle droids had wrist rockets instead of grenades. Clone trooper blasters fire slower but more accurately than Imperial blasters while the latter enjoys a higher rate of fire. Armies had special units, unique to their faction and that added so much flavor to the game. In this iteration all playable classes are carbon copies of each other regardless of which side you choose. All weapon options are clones of each other too.  Bland. Boring. Next?

b.) Hero Characters: In SWBF2 hero characters were highly mobile, allowing you to evade and get into cover until you were ready for onslaught. They enjoyed defensive powers too, like deflecting enemy fire. Each came with a set of unique offensive powers too. My favorite was Force Push. In the early story I used it to one-shot General Grievous by chucking him off the ledge he dramatically drops down on when he shows up. Heroes were powerful! If you were stuck in a small room with Darth Maul, you were rightly doomed. It was great! But this game? The maps are too big so heroes are easily killed by just about any stumbling idiot with a blaster. Often times the excitement of becoming the mighty Lord Vader is quickly stamped out when you get headshot the instant you spawn. Heroes are worthless in this version of SWBF.

c.) Vehicles. This was the biggest letdown of all. When I saw land maps with air support, the chance to pilot an almighty AT-AT, I was practically drooling! But like everything else here, it was disappointment on a galactic scale. As aforementioned the controls were wretched. The air units exist only to provide suicidal fireworks for the folks below. And there was this cool Hoth battle concept where the rebels had to call in Y Wing Airstrikes against the ATATs before being overtaken. That sounds AWESOME but they somehow managed to RUIN it. first off there is no explanation on how the air strikes are summoned or the ATATs piloted. The whole map is one big flat piece of paper so tactical thinking like cover, terrain, high ground are all irrelevant. I just can't believe they went to the trouble of developing this game only to destroy every loveable aspect of it.

My brief and I mean very brief 2 weeks stay in this game has left me permanently scarred for life. Second Life can be summed up none better than a paradise for trolls,perverts, and the socially awkward.

Most of SL is about virtual sex as you will see have dressed characters and in game adult themed places and items pretty much everywhere. Even in non adult areas. You simply can't avoid it. Anyone who plays will lie to you and try to sell you the game as a ""virtual"" world where you can sight see and build things but that honestly makes up a small portion of the game. Maybe people did that 8 years ago but today those places are empty.

Second Lifes population has dwindled as people moved on with their lives but all thats really left are the type of people that you would more than likely not wish to be involved with in any life. Desperate housewives that use the game to virtually cheat on their husbands, lunatics that think the game is real and have substituted it for their actual life, Grown adult weirdoes that like to dress up as animals or role play as children (sure might sound innocent but nothing in this game is innocent), sexual predators and the sexually perverted mostly found playing something called Gorean or running around in rape cities, nerdy adults that want to be vampires, and above all else the worst crowd of all needy/clingy people that use Second Life to get a girlfriend or boyfriend because they fail to do so in the real world.

Its hard to play Second life without feeling pathetic or feeling pity for the people that do play it and have been playing it faithfully for years. Then theres the age old tale of My first life is great but they dump at least 80 hours a week into an online game. Give me a break. Youre real life sucks thus why your in SL trying to escape it. The common lie in second life is that its not a game but a virtual world. This will be told to you over and over again by the highly delusional players of second life. Second life IS a GAME. Just a very outdated one thats no longer relevant. Those that still think of it as a virtual world should perhaps actually catch up to modern times and see what other games youve been missing. If I had to sum it up Second Life is like Grand Theft Auto with the creativeness of Little big planet except without the fun and a terrible buggy platform and engine to build on.

Its a sandbox game where you decide what your fun should be. Its still a game and an MMORPG as everyone on there is role-playing. Either role playing that they're attractive as their avatar or role playing that this game doesnt suck. Its a virtual world as much as any MMORPG with a chat interface and zones to explore or any other online game. The only difference with second life is that the developers make RW money off the land players purchase to build their imaginary zones (which cost hundreds of real dollars youll waste).

So is the game good or is it bad? Well? As a game it was probably good maybe 6-8 years ago but it hasn't aged well. It has the graphics of Windows 95, the world is highly glitchy and buggy. Vehicles can hardly be used because so many places don't allow them and their buggy anyway even if you get to use them, the game crashes randomly and constantly, and to top it off the game is highly tolerant of its problems so they're never fixed.

If you enjoy games youve probably already played plenty better than this and ones albeit with saner people. The most normal folks youll encounter in this game are the trolls because the trolls now its a game and are there to get a laugh. Other players? Well they just seem someone lost mentally.

Some might think its harsh for me to say those things but until you venture into this world you wouldnt truly understand. Second Life is just a haven for delusional people with mental problems to bring their problems into a gave where they can live life as normal as they possibly can by pretending to be normal.

I met a guy playing a Furry shemale Wolf/Aligator as they explained to me in their profile. If that alone doesnt make you eyebrows raise than you might be ready to play second life. Whatever this game once was it is no longer and its no surprise that any corporation pulled themselves from this game as soon as they saw what a cesspool it was. The good community is apparently gone and the company that youd much rather not keep is left.

Not much distinguishes Madden NFL 25 from last year's Madden 13. The game has not been refined at all, but I never buy a madden game two years  back to back and Im sorry I did it this time as well. I will not buy M14 for the PS4, I learned my lesson from xbox360 lonch back in 2006

This years game presentation  is poor. Whith the Infinity engine the game is  the same as years past.
Madden still lags behind 2k sport games, EA Sports series like NHL and FIFA when it comes to visual and audio impact. The interface is awkward and slow. It takes too many button presses to reach many frequently accessed functions, and the game pauses with fairly lengthy loads whenever you move from one menu window to another. There isn't much glitz or attention to fine detail, either. Players and coaches often look nothing like their real-life counterparts. Stadiums are sterile and lifeless, with static graphics, jaggy architecture, and generic jack-in-the-box fans who look like cardboard cutouts mounted on springs.
Further contributing to the visual inconsistencies are animations that are repeated over and over again, like the trainer squirting water into a player's mouth as he comes off the field when a time-out is called. Touchdown celebrations are constantly reused, too. There is also an overall softness to everything after snaps. It's as if the game is just slightly out of focus as you're playing, which is frustrating since the zoomed-in replays shown between plays are typically sharp.

EA has taken out on field sound effects such as the sound of tackling, players talking to one another, and the sound of kicking the football is terrible and you cannot even hear it.
The music is very dated and primitive sounding for an EA Sports game. All you hear are old stadium tracks like the Black Eyed Peas' ""Boom Boom Pow"" and Joe Satriani's ""Crowd Chant,"" along with the odd bit of classic rock like AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck"" and Guns N' Roses' ""Welcome to the Jungle."" The booth duo of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms is atrocious. They offer nothing but inanities, generic observations about the ""offense"" and the ""defense"" that rarely refer to players by name, and loads of those obnoxious ""I'll tell you what"" tics that make Simms so insufferable. Neither of them is watching the game that you're playing. They constantly contradict one another and make mistakes like saying how strong the pass protection has been today just after a QB has been sacked for the fourth time. if you are using a low rated QB, they always say negative things about that QB even when he is playing good.
I always turn them off or mute their terrible in game comments.  I wish I can mute the live in game comments as well.

I will wait until next year  or 2016 to  buy a football for the PS4.

- Modes - There is no ""campaign"" mode; it's really just a series of bot-driven missions with no real purpose. With PSN still down there is no way to even try multiplayer.
- Mechanics - The basic mechanics of an FPS are simply not there. You have to dump an entire clip to kill an enemy, and the grenades don't even kill! They are like stun grenades that don't stun but rather just knock the enemy over! What's up with that??? Did someone really think this is ""fun""?
- Customization - Sure there are plenty of options but why bother? You can't even see yourself so it's a big waste of time and effort.
- XP/Leveling - In the 3 games I played, I earned 3,000+ XP and ranked amongst the top players (bots) in campaign mode. I then found that all these points really amount to very little reward. You get one or two more ""perks"" to purchase but most of what you earn are character customizations which I don't care about one bit!
- SMART system? Does it even exist? Never worked for me!
- Controls - Sluggish as heck, which is further highlighted by the need to traverse all the way back to the objective after you respawn at the ORIGINAL spawn point!
- AI - Very bad. In the very first mission one of the first objectives is to escort a friendly AI, who apparently enjoys walking blindly into a swarm of enemies! What's the deal??

1.0,True,"09 15, 2016",A2XUW4IZP6UPDL,B01GOK4F2I,To Be Simple,"I've been playing EA's NHL games for over two decades now. After making a couple of excellent games near the end of the PS3's life cycle EA has regressed, with NHL 17 being one of the worst games they have ever made in terms of my main reason for gaming -- fun. This game is simply tedious to play and not much fun.

EA has added a draft game mode that is actually a nice mode and well designed. HUT has been modified a bit and still a great mode. Likewise, franchise mode has seen some changes for the better and I commend EA for showing some love to gamers looking to play offline modes. The various other modes are ok, but nothing special.

Unfortunately, EA has failed miserably in the most important aspect of a sports game -- gameplay. It's poor. After applying the four-plus gb update to the game I began playing the various modes at various difficulty levels. The top two difficulty levels are the only levels that gave me anywhere close to a competitive game, so that is where I've played my games over the 20 or so hours I've put into the game.

I'm not sure what the developers were thinking in regard to the AI, but it does not resemble hockey. The CPU team plays the stickiest defense known to mankind. It is darn near impossible to get a good cycling game going in the offensive zone because the CPU defense plays magically sticky defense. In actual hockey the way to counter players over-commiting on D is to skate around the players and the players off the puck can get into the open fairly easily when the D over-commits. Sadly in NHL 17 the user's team AI teammates make little to no effort to get open and stand around like pylons much of the time. To add insult to injury the CPU players poke check like mad men, making clean passes very hard to string together. They also have superhuman hand-eye coordination, making deflections of passes ridiculously common and bogs down any flow to the game.

Which brings me to the next issue. Passing in this game is horrid. I have played with pass assist on and no pass assist whatsoever. Passing success can be a crapshoot. There is no rhyme or reason to have passing be so unpredictable. I'm a skilled NHL gamer who understands the mechanics of passing and the concept of momentum and direction in passing. NHL 17 simply does not get passing correct and realistic in any way.

The player's cpu-controlled teammates are as dumb as ever. On offense the d-men at the blueline frequently watch a pass I make down low toward the bueline near the boards go right by them without even making an effort to receive the pass. Laughably, they are not even facing the right direction much of the time. Players on offense also do not seem to understand the whole idea of how to get into the correct position. On defense the user-controlled AI is just plain ridiculous. While the cpu defense plays sticky defense and clogs the lane and puts a body on players, the user-controlled defenders play like headless chickens and let the CPU set up in the slot for easy uncontested shots. By the time the user can switch players it's frequently too late to get a player who is out of position into the proper position. This was an issue in NHL 16 as well. I won't even get into the horrible player switching in the game. The game somehow is very unintuitive in switching to the proper man when the user tries to switch players.

I have only touched upon a few of the many issues with the AI in this game. There are too many to discuss in a reasonable amount of space. I could write a small book on how horrid and unrealistic the goalie play is in the game. I'm not sure how much the developers know about hockey, but judging from this game it's not a whole lot. It's ashamed because there are plenty of good modes and options in NHL 17. However, if the game is tedious and not fun to play then all of the window dressing is meaningless. I'm sure adjusting the sliders can help the gameplay somewhat in offline play, but in online play and several of the more compelling modes the user is required to play with the settings the developers throw at them. In the end NHL 17 is a hot mess in terms of gameplay and AI. I am hopeful that next year the developers put more effort into making the game halfway fun to play with somewhat intelligent AI and not a bogged down AI crapfest.",Lazy Programming and Tedious Gameplay,1473897600,22,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

So why is it so bad? Well there is an unbelievable amount of hit detection issues. The kinds where you'll pump a guy point blank with 20 rounds (literally an entire clip in some instances)  and you can see blood splatter...but no hit markers, and no dead player. However two shots from them and you're dead. Yet the kill cam shows something far different than what you saw. And the camping....the levels are pretty damn big some of them,  and everyone just seems to camp. Especially snipers and shot gunners. Giving you no chance really. I have been playing first person shooters for years. Everything from Call of Duty, to Battlefield,  to Halo. And I have never done as bad as I have in this game. Ever. I have only had one...literally one match where I went positive. There's no regional match match making so I often get stuck with people who have very poor Internet. The result is I get 2 kills...and about 20 deaths on average simply due to hitmarkers not registering.  I even get delayed kills. When I shoot a guy full of lead, and get mowed down by him. Then soon as I Spawn the hitmarkers start randomly popping up on my screen along with points for a kill. Kind of like Battlefield 4 was at launch. On top of that, there is no option to search for specific maps to play on. I have played about 30 matches now. I have the season pass (really wish I didn't buy it cause I would get rid of this game if I hadn't but it's the last call of duty I will ever buy and it's really so me and my buddies can play) and I have yet to play anything.. ANYTHING outside of nuketown and 4 other maps. I always get popped into the same maps. On top of that, you can Spawn, promptly get killed,  Spawn again..AND GET KILLED BY THW SAME GUY AS SOON AS YOU SPAWN. But it doesn't end their. As if twice wasn't enough,  I have had it happen as many as four times in a row. You can Spawn right in the middle of the map just to get sniped as soon as you Spawn. I have even spawned in front of one of the enemy ground drones....I lasted less than four seconds.  And this happens in every...single...match. I have never gotten so mad at a game before.  Not even that I'm losing... Just that it's basically unplayable.  Now I wasn't sure if it was just me experiencing these things so I did some research..... There are forums FULL of these same complaints.  And no word from the developers on if or when they may be patched. Now my biggest issue isn't really any of what I previously explained. My biggest issue is not only does this game not work (zombies is terrific,  a lot of fun, and the offline modes are mostly error free except the A.I. Is horrible. You can run around a map with a full enemy A.I. team just to find them all standing in a corner.  That happens a lot. Fun fact though...the A.I. Won't just sit there.....they tbag. It's kind if funny sometimes)  but now you basically HAVE to play online of you want to unlock all the weapons which you get by spending crypto keys in the black market. To put this in perspective... I spent ten bucks on I think 1000 cod points, got all rare supply drops....all I got was taunts and paint schemes.... I have also spent about 90 hours playing this and I eventually unlocked a weapon...a crossbow.  Without these crypto keys that you can either play about... 15 matches to get thirty of them for a rare drop which is immensely time consuming,  and HOPE you get something (most don't and you do get duplicates of stuff. Each drop only unlocks three things at a time and many items you can only equip at certain ranks, making them pretty useless if you're a level 20 like me. Btw leveling up takes FOREVER.  It's painfully long.) or you can drop stupid amounts of money to buy them and often still end up with nothing you want. Some of these weapons are pretty damn powerful especially the shotgun. So it's essentially become a pay to win game. Or pay to access content already built into the game is a better description. You can't access the majority of this stuff offline by the way.  Those weapons that are supply drop locked you can not use offline without first buying them. Along with the all the melee weapons (aside from the starter knife) and most of the camos and character costume parts. Seriously just avoid this game. Please. I really wish I didn't buy it. It could be really really fun but it was just executed poorly and with maximum profits in mind instead of the fans and gamers themselves.  Keep in mind this is really the ONLY reliable franchise that Activision has right now so I suppose it was just a matter of time.

1.0,False,"09 30, 2005",A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F,B000809NXC,Mike,"I decided to write this review pretty early, but only because I want to save some people their money. It's not that I hate the game, but it really just doesn't have enough substance to make it a reccomendable purchase.

Somebody has found something to complain about with each RPG Maker. RPG Maker 1 for playstation was excellent, yet people didn't like spending so much time creating games. The game also had some weird problems. Sometimes certain triggers would not work even though I spent hours inspecting them. Still, it was a fun game to play and it looked and sounded great for a 2d game. RPG Maker 2 was way too complicated. I don't mind spending time having to learn alot to play a game, but some things in RPG Maker 2 were ridiculous. If you wanted your attacks to do damage in a battle, you had to make a trigger for your items and a trigger for your items triggers and then an attack trigger. It was a little too advanced. Still, some people had fun with it.

RPG Maker 3 has improved on some old problems. Alot of people complained about having no character portraits, and they put them in this game. Some of them match up with the characters, however 80 % of them do not look like the character models. That is another problem. There aren't that many character models in the game. It is ridiculous as to how few people there are and how many towns I plan on creating. You will see the same people over and over again. Also, alot of those models don't look good for the characters I have in mind. I just want some normal looking adventurers, yet many of the models are too strange looking. Even worse, your party will consist of the most stereotypical characters ever. Personally, I wanted a thief who could carry an axe. HOWEVER! The only male character model that could carry an axe was a dwarf. If I want my guy to carry an axe into battle, he has to be that dwarf model. If I want some dude to carry a sword into battle, he can either look like a gladiator or Charlton Heston from Ben-Hur. To sum this up, the character models are too limited and probably won't appeal to what you like.

Making towns, houses, and field menus is easy. You can create some interesting places pretty simply. Here's the problem with this feature, you can only create so much towns. You can't create an epic RPG because you are limited to how much stuff you can create. Plus, the game takes like 2400 memory. This is the most I have EVER seen on a game. The second highest was grand theft auto for 1100 memory. The game takes 2400 memory per game you create. Memory cards only come with 8000 or so memory. 2400 is ridiculous.

Creating events is like RPG Maker 1. Most of it is easy and it isn't nearly as complicated as RPG Maker 2. The storytelling feature is interesting. You can only create a limited number of storytelling stuff though, so that sucks.

The controls in the game aren't that good. You can only select options in the battle menu with the d-pad. In the terrain editor mode, the d-pad moves too slow, yet the analog stick moves real fast. To look around your character, you can use the right analog stick, yet it doesn't move fast enough. The worst part aobut the control scheme is walking. I shouldn't have to complain about walking, but it is alot like resident evil. You can only move forward and turn around real slowly. If you hold down the analog stick as far as it can go, your character will walk so f'ing slow. In order to sprint, you have to hold the triangle button down. This is AWFUL. It does not feel comfortable to hold triangle down. Besides, the triangle button is pressure sensitive. If you don't press down on it firmly it doesn't work. They screwed up because they made it so that you have to hold it down as far as it will go, otherwise you won't run.

The most striking problem of all... if you don't want to spend money on a keyboard for your playstation, don't even bother buying this game.

Wait, one more problem. Many times in battle when you cast a spell your playstation will have to slow down and load for a second or two. You will notice this and say, ""What the hell? I shot off a fireball and my system had trouble loading?"" It confuses me too, but apparently this game can't even handle it's crappy looking spell animations.

Wait, I found another problem. All the spell animations in the game look stupid. You can barely customize them, and it isn't fun doing that. They should of used RPG Maker 2's spell animation stuff because it was really fun and interesting.

To be honest, this game just isn't worth 50 dollars. It can be good, but it is so limited that eventually you won't care about how beautiful the terrain CAN look. If for 50 dollars you got the game, a keyboard, a memory card(because the game takes up a little over 1/4th of your memory card's memory), a hard-drive(there's a feature to use a hard drive because the game can't load up simple spell animations), and a network card to download people's games online, the game might be worth it.","New game, New problems",1128038400,38,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},

The same thing tends to happen when I'm using the Danger Room computer, or using an Xtraction Point to change my team: the screen will go black, and I'll find myself back at the title screen.

The Hero Stash is another source of frustration.  You're allowed to keep up to 60 things in there, but I've discovered that anytime I exceeded 15, all the equipment from Beast/Forge's shop that was for sale would just vanish.  That's right; Beast/Forge would suddenly just stop selling stuff to you (except for potions and the Grab Bag), and I could not get the shop to start offering stuff again, even after I got rid of some stuff from the Hero Stash.

Also, you probably noticed that defeated enemies and breakable objects often cough up tech bits and, more rarely, armor and equipment.  I've noticed that all this stops right around the end of Chapter 2: I can't get any money (tech bits) from that point on, no matter how many enemies I beat!  How the HECK am I supposed to buy potions and armor and equipment without any money?

All these bugs have screwed up my save data permanently several times already, and I've had to start the game over from the beginning each time, hoping that I can do something differently each time to avoid the bugs, but no such luck.  Frankly, I'm now sick of trying.

What was Raven Software doing with this game???  Did they even have a Quality Assurance department?  Hey Raven, you guys NEED to come out with X Men Legends 3, and you NEED to address the bugs.  That's the ONLY way you'll make up for releasing an UNFINISHED game onto the market.

Today I noticed that the neoprene rubber backing on both of the leg bands is tearing along the seam at the end of the velcro strap.  Each leg band has been used for approximately 24 workouts (equivalent to being worn for 12 hours). I contacted customer support and was told that EA's official policy was that the bands would only be replaced under warranty within 90 days of purchase, no matter how little they were used before the damage was discovered.  The customer support representative commented that this has been a very common failure and that the warranty department has been absolutely inflexible on the expiration of the warranty period.

The flaw in the design is obvious.  The line of stitches places holes (which concentrate stress) along the edge of where the inflexible velcro strap meets the flexible neoprene backing.  That promotes formation of rips starting at those holes.  EA should fix the design and replace all of the bands of the old design that fail.

The resistance band is very soft and does not provide nearly enough resistance for most adults.  I purchased a 3-pack of light/medium/heavy resistance bands from sporting goods store, and even the light band was significantly stiffer than the EA Sports band.

The story was lame and the action tedious and redundant. Also a few years before the game was actually released all the previews were totally different, there were images a cloaked baddies, and a totally interactive environment. This game feels like it started out as a huge sprawling sandbox action/adventure/horror/mystery then due to budget cuts ended up a lame shooter.

Graphics -
+ Nice, environments were very detailed
- Environments all looked the same.

Combat
Innovative system of breaking down enemy shields with a flash light then shooting them to kill them. Cool at first, gets old real fast.

Game-play -
This game consists of going from point a to point b and getting to a plot point then repeat. There are 3 types of enemies, and a couple of unimaginative bosses (a back-hoe for example). The environments while nicely detailed all look the same, with little to no thought in the level design, often you just head in a straight line through a generic forest, a generic building, or a generic office. The is combat fun at first, but once the novelty wears off (about 15-20 minutes) it get's boring. what makes matters worse is the cheap shots the enemies take. You'll find yourself just walking along or worse, fighting off a horde of baddies, when all of a sudden they start spawning right behind you, basically right on top of you. This happens so often and becomes so damn frustrating that you'll be tempted to quit, not due to the challenge but due to the fact that the game just isn't fun enough t keep you caring. I finished the game in a day, yeah it's that short, and that easy (minus the cheap shots.)

Re-Playability -
None, getting through this stinker once is a test of will-power

Verdict -
Possible rental, if it's cheap, or borrow it from an unfortunate friend who got taken in by the slick packaging. You shouldn't pay more than 5 bucks for this, if you are really, really curious though.",Stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinker! P U,1320192000,,,

That's when I found out that Blizzard had invented a brand-new feature for single-player games: massive, crippling lag. It's a surprising bonus, since you've just spent the last 30 minutes installing untold gigabytes of data onto your computer. Yet somehow, the thing needs to constantly pull data from the Internet - even though there's no one in dungeon but you.

You click, you wait, you die - often with no idea why.

But let's assume for a minute that Blizzard figures out its servers eventually and the lag returns to a semi-acceptable level where the game is playable. Then you find out about the errors. Tons of them. Errors that could have been fixed during this game's literal decade of development. Yes, you read that correctly, it took more than a decade to create this garbage. Yet you'll find constant errors that kick you out of the game, reset your character and shut off your game permanently. Yes, it sounds like it's made-up, but it's not.

For instance, I was lucky enough to encounter an error 316704 (party error) which kicked me out of the game and wouldn't allow me to return. The confusing part was, I wasn't in a party. I was playing a single-player game.

Blizzard managed to spend 11 years developing a game that doesn't run properly, and isn't very fun - even when it's not shutting itself down. The fact is, most of these problems could have easily been fixed by not requiring an Internet connection to play an offline game. But that would have been too obvious.

Better to be clever and release a game that no one can ever hope to play without losing all their progress to a random blip in cyberspace.

When Diablo 3 does run, it's mildly amusing, sort of like Torchlight except worse. So if you like that, then you'll like this in a few months when the glitches have been dealt with. But I don't have the time to waste waiting for my character to catch up to my mouse pointer so I can die by the hand of invisible monsters.

As other reviewers noted, the mouse did not come with all items listed in the description, but the packaging was neat. The software is very limited, and all but worthless. The mouse looked like a good ergonomic mouse, however once I held this for the first time I knew it wasn't going to work well for gaming or any longer than 5 minutes of use. That was the case once I sat down and used it, my wrist started to feel strained after the first 15 minutes. The problem is there is nowhere for your pinkie to rest, unless you use it with your index finger and middle finger on the left & right, and place your ring finger on the 2 top right side buttons. Using it this way you loose allot of control, and for gaming is unusable.

Something the item description lists is that this mouse has a 1 Ghz Frequency polling rate. An obvious oversight in whoever wrote this; as mouse polling rate is usually measured in hertz (hz) and this was listed in Gigahertz (Ghz) and 1Ghz equals 1000000000hz. I believe they were trying to convey a 1000hz polling rate for the mouse. I used Mouse Rate to test the response time and on average measured 450hz, with peaks in the 550 range. Which is still a very good response rate but not the 1000hz listed in the item description. I found no way to modify this in the software.

The last straw for me on this mouse was during use. I loaded up CS:GO and went into the workshop crosshair select v2 which will allow you to try out different crosshairs, and test using them on some bots which do some basic strafing. When I got into the firing range I like to test accuracy by aiming about 90 degrees away, snapping to them and try for headshots. WHEN THE MOUSE IS MOVED AT A FAST RATE IT CUTS OUT! ..... Would make it to about the 90 degrees and stop moving! I thought maybe it was just something with the DPI/CPI setting (800 at the time) so I kicked it up through all levels, and found it to happen on all settings. After this find I unplugged the mouse, put it back in the box, and filed a return for refund.

In conclusion, I know what is listed on paper in combination with it's price point sounds attractive, but the mouse just fails to deliver on all fronts. Not sure what Sentey was thinking with this one, as in my experience they generally make a great products. The mouse I received was more than likely defective, but with the ergonomics also in mind, I could not use this mouse, and would suggest regardless of hand size, that you look elsewhere for a mouse for any application.

Having been a hard-core Thief player back in the day, I was super excited to see a revamped version of it. Especially with what we're able to do with next-gen technology. But, none of that mattered with this version... because the ball was dropped at every level.

The game play is just flat-out boring. The main character, Garrett, and his little girl-toy, are just flat-out ugly. Hideous, in fact. I have no idea what the storyline is or who the bad guy is. I can't find even half of the items to steal... not that it matters anyway, because I don't care to buy anything because the game is so boring.

Did I mention the game is boring?  I don't mean to be a ""hater,"" but this franchise has a time-honored tradition of excellence. And this version is such a terrible disappointment. My advice is, don't bother. Find another game for the PS4. Maybe even one you wouldn't like. It'll still be better than this one.

1.0,False,"09 2, 2006",AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B000A6K6D0,coopertex,"Urban Reign is a beatem'up fighting game for the PS2. You fight several gangs to gain territory and advance the storyline. The graphics are really good; character models look good, level environment can be damaged, and great looking fighting moves.

  Actually the fighting moves are the best part of the game. Using a combination of fighting styles that range from boxing, karate and wrestling- you can do the regular punch, kicks, jump kicks, grabs and body slams. You acquire more moves as you progress through the game and also increase your skill stats. Your skill stats consists of your punching, kicking, grapple and defensive powers; by increasing your stats, your character becomes much more stronger (though this happens over the long haul). I was impressed with some of the fighting animations as your character can do flips, jump in the air and kick multiple enemies at once and you can throw them into objects like cars, trash cans and the walls. A lot of the fighting reminded me of the many, Jackie Chan movies with clever fighting techniques and they were just as fun to watch in motion within Urban Reign. I also like the fact that the game is very long and contains 100 levels as apposed to just 15 levels like many other fighting games. Urban Reign sounds great right? So where did it go wrong?

  The disaster begins with the unresponsive controls, you'll be button mashing like crazy and become irrate when the character executes moves slowly. Many times you'll want to beat up your enemies in a certain way while they are in a daze, to be hindered by your character's sluggish response. Many of the missions have a short time limit which will frustrate you even more. Although you can increase your character's stat skills and make him stronger, the CPU enemies will always be stronger. Aside from that you can be pushed into a corner and get pounded continuously with cheap shots from the CPU. Other than the fighting, nothing much else is taking place inside the levels; which gives it a empty feeling and the city overall seems abandoned and dead. The difficulty level will also tick off a lot of players as it just increases from normal to super hard in a short time. The worst thing about Urban Reign, is the terrible defensive blocking system, which they call ""deflecting"". You have to press the block button at the right moment to deflect the CPU's attacks, if you press it at the wrong time you will receive the punch/kick. While so many fighting games allow you to just hold the block button, this game does not. The story mode can only be played by one player, so you cannot play with a friend! The challange mode (unlockable) can be played co-op, but it would have been better and more fun if the story mode could be played this way. If you want a better fighting game, look elsewhere because this is not it.

Pros:
+cool fighting techniques
+100 levels

Cons:
-terrible blocking system
-sluggish controls
-dumb story
-one player in story mode
-tons of cheap shots by CPU
-you can be cornered

1.0,False,"08 13, 2002",A343DKR8HKOE0K,B00004TSXC,Peter,"Neverwinter Nights is really not a computer game in the traditional sense.  It's more of an electronic version of the pen and paper role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons.  If you are an avid D&D player who can't get your group together at your own house, you now have the internet to do it.  While this is fine for pen and paper D&D groupies, the rest of us are left out in the cold.
Basically, Neverwinter Nights is set up in the hopes that a community will help it grow.  The game comes with a sample campaign to play but it also comes with a complete editor that lets anyone design their own D&D adventures.  Either with the official campaign included in box or some of the community made mods (there are already 500+ available online), you can play Neverwinter Nights by yourself or online with a group of players.  To further enhance the pen and paper D&D experience, there is even a dungeon master client in the game.  If you don't know what a dungeon master is I can already tell you you're purchasing the wrong game.  Basically, a DM watches over the mod and controls the adventure to hopefully provide a better game for the players.  Sort of like an invisible referee.
This all sounds great when reading it on the back of the box but I'm not sure it really works.  For one thing, while the editor has a lot of capabilities, every map has that same square-look to it to fit in the D&D grid system.  Nothing looks natural and after playing a few mods you've seen everything the game has to offer and it all starts to repeat itself.  Also, for a game that relies on the community to invent new adventures, the editor is more difficult than it should be.  If you don't know programming basics, you're going to have a difficult time with the editor as every simple action has to be scripted which is basically simple C+ programming.  To accomodate this new system and catch up with its competitors, Neverwinter Nights also has a new 3-D system that reminds me of hack and slash games like Diablo more than the company's previous classic release Baldur's Gate I and II.  In fact, the official campaign included in the game is NOTHING compared to the Baldur's Gate games and I would recommend that you not buy this game if the official campaign is the only thing you will play.  The included campaign is boring, linear and not that creative, it's more of a sample for the editor rather than an epic adventure.
If you plan on only playing online, be careful if you only have a 56K modem.  You'll never be able to host more than 3 players on your computer without lag.  Also, you'll have a difficult time joining the large servers with 20+ players if your connection is slow.  Neverwinter Nights comes with an ingame browser that divides online games by category.  You can join the action channel, the roleplaying channel, etc.  Most of these games are called persistent worlds and are basically smaller versions of Everquest. While they can be for awhile because of their small size and limited equipment, quests, etc., they never provide much fun.  The best way to play the game is to get together with a group of friends and meet on a weekly basis just like you would the pen and paper D&D.  While you can find people to play with through online fan sites, you'll have a much better time with this game if you already know people that own it and are willing to play the same mod with you at scheduled times.
After trying this game for a month, frankly, I feel cheated.  I bought the game because it promised gamers that even if they didn't want to play online or use the editor they could play the official campaign included in the game by themselves and have just as much fun as they did with the company's other epic releases Baldur's Gate I and II.  That's a misleading claim because the new mechanics of Neverwinter Nights and the boring campaign included are pitiful attempts to live up to the company's previous PC D&D games.  This game is really only for people that want to enjoy an electronic pen and paper version of D&D, the rest of us should move on to Icewind Dale II or Morrowind or hope that another company manages to design a great singleplayer RPG as fantastic as the Baldur's Gate series.",An ambitious experiment in PC gaming but a failure,1029196800,11,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

(EDIT: The wording on this did not make sense I changed it.)

If you did not like Battlefield: Bad Company 2 or Battlefield 3 this game is no different. Just a Graphical update and some new maps.

With that said I am running the Game on Ultra, and though in screen shots the difference between BF3 and BF4 looks awesome.. In the actual game I often forget I am playing BF4. The graphics simply do not look any different when in the midst of battle.  Black Ops 2 Still looks MUCH better in most areas of game play. BF3 and BF 4 do look better when you are looking out at a vista. But that is a matter of opinion.

As of this review the game is 100% not noob friendly. Everyone in the game after 10 hours of multi-player is a crack shot and will snipe you from all over the map on all of the maps. In fact I have not played a single game in the past 24 hours where each team was not apparently 80% snipers.

Spawn camping (getting killed the moment the level loads) Is extremely bad in the game. A few maps are worse than others, but for the most part every single map design allows for you to be shpot in the head before you are even done loading into the game.

Also my experiences with Amazon Customer Service and Origin Customer Service have been less than ideal. I have been trying to trurn the game with multiple calls to amazon and Origin and neither will budge. I understand that it is not the norm to allow the return of games, but that needs to change. I will probably be making my next game purchase (CoD:Ghosts?) From Gamestop simply due to their very generous return policy.

But the control system--terrible. The way the world whips around constantly at the slightest mouse movement made me want to throw up. You'd think you could fix this tendency by altering the mouse sensitiviy, but you'd be wrong. At the lowest setting BO2 still resembles the jerky camera parts of Saving Private Ryan--and I mean that in a bad, unexciting way. Also, what's up with no strafe controls? You can't bind any keys to move your player sideways. When you get in a fight the keys that previously and redundantly (since the mouse does that already) rotated the character are mysteriously transformed into the missing strafe keys. Why Eidos would abandon the tried-and-true Quake-type controls in this game is a mystery. I suspect it's an artifact left over from BO2's console port. With its whacky control system, the hardest part about BO2 is keeping your lunch down.
Also, parents should take note of the ""Mature"" rating for this game. If ever a game deserved an ""M"" rating (or worse), this one does. This is coming from someone who's enjoyed other ""M"" rated games like Soldier of Fortune which features gory, war-type violence directed at armed soldiers (with a penalty for killing civilians). But Blood Omen 2 takes violence in a very dark direction. As a vampire you're encouraged to view humans as food and feed on them wherever you find them. In practical terms, this includes walking up to old ladies and clubbing them to death as they scream for you to stop. They fall down and try to crawl away while begging for their life and you have to beat them to death before you drink their blood (necessary to refill your health meter). While I generally view ""kills"" in video games as cartoonishly entertaining, I found this level of violence disturbing. I suppose it's passed off as ""natural"" vampire behavior (though I wonder about the public response if these were, say, Harp seals being clubbed instead of people). Everyone's got their own standard regarding game violence. Mine's pretty liberal, but this is the first game that made me feel like I'd seriously signed up with the Dark Side.

(-) Pedestrian content that's non-interactive. There are only brief cut scenes that place the player in a passive role. There's almost no context-sensitive, scripted, or interactive events of any kind. Just kill, collect, or deliver.

(-) A glaring lack of content, especially quests and PvP. For PvP, there's only the most basic, familiar trappings from pre-2003 MMOs: open world only - no organized or instanced PvP, no rated team play, et cetera. For PvE/quests, the content is so thin and unrewarding (in regards to experience and currency earned for completion) that you'll be grinding very early on

(-) Time and money sinks are ubiquitous and detract from immersion: chance of failure on gathering/crafting/gear enhancement (which are all expensive), experience loss upon death along with substantial fees to reclaim it, expensive forms of rapid transit, severe limitations on storage and trade, etc, etc, etc

(-) The communication/chat system and user interface feel like they were birthed in 2001

(-) Real money traders (people that sell in-game, virtual currency for real money) are everywhere - flooding the chat channels endlessly with their announcements, sending you mails, and even sitting out in the open world for days with loud advertisements above their head. The tools provided by the user to ignore or filter them are amateur, barely useful, and place a burden upon the user. Their automated characters (""bots"", clients controlled by programs that script/automate the functions of a human being) litter the landscape, you're forced to directly compete with them for resources (quest mobs, hell any mobs, crafting materials, etc). This all bleeds into the economy of the game, since they have endless resources and drive up the in-game costs of items on the auction house. Since the punitive, grinding nature of the game encourages all of this, and NCSoft (developer) apparently has no intentions of stopping it, it continues to escalate daily.

1.0,False,"04 10, 2015",A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B004J6I0YO,Adrian Jenkins,"Holy smokes - I am stunned to read the praise of this stinker. With no hyperbole, these games (well, the two I made it through) rank among the worst games I have ever played, on any system. I bought this game years ago (for a price lower than Amazon's current one). I played through Sands of Time, and it took me three years to start Warrior Within (and honestly, I only started it because I was sick of seeing the 0% on my PSN account). I played Warrior Within, and nearly cried.

How bad are these games? Let me count the ways:

The Sands of Time (1 star): Where do I begin? Well, let's start with aesthetics. SoT is one of the ugliest games I've seen (even accounting for its time of release). Combat is a joke, which is good, because the combat system is atrocious. Outside of combat, the game is slow and pretty boring. The excitement is generated solely by the biggest offender here - the wonky control. You will die, quite a bit, simply because the controller betrays you. I can appreciate the concept here, but the execution is flawed beyond belief. Although the game takes less than 10 hours to play and plat, I can't even recommend it to trophy hunters. It's just too frustrating to die because the control betrays you on a wall climb (and it WILL betray you). There is nothing difficult here, other than the pathetic development of the game.

Warrior Within (0 stars): Sands of Time caused me to wait 3+ years before I played Warrior Within. And Warrior Within makes Sands of Time look like God of War. Were it not for the fact that the concept is good, Warrior Within might rank as the worst game on the PS3 (taking over the slot ignominiously held by Man Vs. Wild or Deathly Hallows I). All of the problems in Sands of Time are magnified tenfold here. I know this game inside and out, due to the fact that I had to play through it THREE TIMES to get the plat. Every problem in this game is burned into my mind. Where do I begin?

Well, somehow, this game is actually uglier than Sands of Time. The CGI scenes are choppy, and the in-game scenes are just pathetic. Women who are ostensibly sexy looks like brides of Frankenstein. The prince himself has an atrocious design. Further, the change between the CGI and the in-game cutscenes is remarkably jarring. There is an (embarrassing) sequence early on with an enemy wearing a revealing gray thong. But in the game? Looks like a black bikini bottom. At one point, the prince becomes the Sand Wraith. The CGI looks good here - the Sand Wraith looks like some creepy Heartless or something. In game? I wouldn't even recognize him as the same character. Enemy designs are poor, environmental graphics are a mess - this looks like a rushed, shoddy production.

The story is a standard time travel plot, with absolutely no logic to it whatsoever. It's not complicated to follow, but it's complicated to explain rationally. Time travel rarely works, but when it does, one needs to have some kind of rule or structure. Long story short...<yawn>. You're playing out the string for most of the game, and only at the very end do you get any payoff whatsoever.

The combat in this game might be the worst combat I've seen in 10 years. It is execrable. In some games, combat allows you to lock onto enemies. In others, you are free to move about. In the former, the control often switches to a different ""combat"" scheme when you lock on. In the latter, the control scheme generally remains the same. Warrior Within eschews both of these ideas for some god-awful hybrid. The game somehow chooses your lock-on for you. In battle against a single enemy, this is fine, but against multiple enemies, the game is poor at switching to the nearest threat. The AI is effectively stupid here - they drift in and out of combat, which would generally make them easy to deal with, BUT since you can't choose to whom you are locked on, this actually serves them well; as the current threat dances away, new threats will come forward. You remain locked onto the previous threat, and take a beating from the new one. Thus, there is little strategy in combat - run around, stick and move, boring boring.

Even more problematic is the fact that the control scheme changes in combat. As in many games, you have a jump button and an attack button. However, in combat, the jump button becomes a sort of dodge roll. I won't even begin explaining how horribly this roll is controlled. My biggest problem is that sometimes, the game decides, ""Nah, you don't need to roll here. Instead, just JUMP OFF A CLIFF TO YOUR DEATH."" In particular, when you fight the final boss(es - depending on game choices, the final boss can change), you are on a suspended structure. If you dodge roll too close to the end of the cliff, the prince just does a Peter Pan off of the structure (literally - he will turn, face the opposite direction of the boss, and jump to his death). Yes, you can rewind time, blah blah blah, but again, the fault is completely in the control. Why the game didn't dedicate one button to dodging, and one to jumping, I'll never know. There are 8 easily-accessible buttons available!

Despite these horrid combat controls, the game is remarkably easy. You can skip many encounters (basically, as long as you can get your character out of combat position, you can run away). With the exception of one of the final bosses, the rest are painfully easy, even on the hardest difficulty (that boss, the Dahaka, makes up for it - he is brutally difficult on the highest difficulty, and no picnic on the lowest). Basically, Warrior Within is like Sands of Time in this regard - your greatest enemy is control...
...
...and the camera. I remember horrid cameras from the PS1 days, and a few later games. The camera here is one of the worst I can remember. You are constantly fighting with it in combat. Moreover, combat controls are based on your position relative to your enemy, and not on the camera. In short, the control directions can change on the fly, relative to your field of vision.

Given that this is Prince of Persia, there is also the wall-running, trap-dodging, and general mayhem you've come to know. Again, control craps the bed. While traps can be difficult to manoeuvre on their own, the shoddy controls make them much, MUCH more difficult than they should be. Moreover, there are timed sections in the game, which are just painfully bad because of the control (and that's too bad - this had much potential).

Oh, let us not forget the soundtrack. It is hilariously inept. As an old metalhead, I just shook my head most of the time. It doesn't fit the game in any way, shape of form. Sound in general is bad - the voice work is mediocre, and the general screeches made by enemies are jarring because they sound so bad. Moreover, sometimes they are muted terribly, and other times, they blare our of your speakers.

All of this would be worthy of 1 star, but what really puts the feces icing on the cake are the glitches. Ubisoft has always been bad about QC, but you would think that they would fix gamebreaking glitches on a re-release. Nope. It is entirely possible (and pretty easy, actually) to glitch your game so that, just as you move to the final boss, it freezes, and you can't do anything other than start over. Collecting all of the collectables in a single playthrough is a good way to accomplish this (the ninth treasure chest, in particular, often causes this glitch).

Moreover, there are design flaws in the game. If you do levels out of (a completely unknown) order, you can put yourself into a situation that requires you to start over (and again, you will only see this near the end of the game). This is unacceptable.

Finally, back in the day, I'm pretty sure that you could unlock earlier Prince of Persia titles in this game. That's been removed. Sorry - there's money to be made. Contrast this, e.g., with the Metal Gear HD Collection (one of the best), which left in the excellent Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.

Shame on Ubisoft for allowing this, and shame on these reviewers who look past these very real flaws in praising this crap-pile.

This game is a throwback to yesteryear...a very old style game.  RPG?  Maybe back then.

There is no voice dialogue.  Characters' mouths move, but there are no words. Instead, there is written text on screen that you get to read, and then click on your text response.

The graphics are dated, and remind me of a kids game...very colorful.

You cannot change any of the key bindings...and there are lots of them. To see the key bindings, hover over objects in the game, or consult the game manual.

Space and planet graphics are very 2 dimensional.

The music and sounds are dated.

Over time, things slowly change.  A new haircut, new clothes, new group of friends, etc.  The changes are slow, incremental.  Each change is only slight enough that you notice it, but the familiarity is still there.  You have your fights, things are said, mistakes are made (Ghosts), but you are committed and you stick with it.  Then, one day, you're in the middle of your routine and you realize that the relationship is over.  Your significant other has changed so much that they are unrecognizable.  That's what's happened here.

COD slowly lost the plot through previous years.  They've kept all the weird changes and updates from old editions, just layering them on top of each other.  This is so far from the fundamentals that made it great that I would not have been able to recognize it as a COD title but for ""CALL OF DUTY"" being slapped on the cover.

You can make your own class, but then you have mech armor/suits layered on top of that.  There are some strange choices in the tactical grenade menu.  They've kept that weapon/item that charges throughout the round.  Then my personal pet peeve, the jumping/jet pack and wall running, is still in the game.  They have now completed the transition from a solid, fundamental FPS to the dudebro, Dorito and Mountain Dew choice of 12 year olds everywhere.  This is ADHD in video game form.

The only redeeming quality about this game is the Legacy Edition came with one of the best COD titles and multiplayer ability.  Even then, Activision won't let me sell off the IW disc if I still want to play MW.  I guess I will have to come to terms with the fact that I paid $70.00 for a remastered Modern Warfare and got a cheap Halo knockoff  included.  The remastered Modern Warfare is the only reason why I can give this a star (and the fact that Amazon does not allow a zero star review).",This game is like your first serious relationship,1478390400,900,"{'Edition:': ' Legacy', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",
1.0,False,"07 6, 2014",A13A943ZWQVT0Z,B000SSPH3E,A. Golden,"A lot of people seem to disagree with me here but I find this version to be a big downgrade from the original. Here are the differences, broken into pros and cons:

Pros:
-New classes (but they're really not very good anyway and reuse animations/skills from the old game)
-Two new characters (again, they're not really that good and not worth it)
-""Improved"" dialogue, which I actually hated more than the old dialogue
-Some tweaks and balancing fixes, which are actually a good thing
-New cinematics

The only two pros that are actually a good thing, IMO, are the tweaks/balance fixes and the cinematics. However, there was still something charming about the old cinematics, so I don't mind going without them.

Cons:
-Obnoxious slowdown that will drive you insane if you've played the original
-IMO, the new writing is awful. I was excited to hear that they'd rewritten the dialogue to make it less confusing and better than the old, poorly translated version. However, to me, it's even worse. It attempts to use some Old English language that is very confusing and cheesy, with terrible grammar. They should have hired better writers for this.
-The audio quality is DOWNGRADED. In a game with such an amazing soundtrack, this is a huge issue for me. If you don't believe me, get both versions on the Vita and listen to them side by side, with or without headphones. The music reverberates beautifully in the original game but sounds flat and dull in the new version.
-LOWER resolution, at least on the Vita. Buy the original PS1 version and it actually looks better (sharper)
-For some reason it seems they want you to have to click a lot more in this version to confirm movements and actions. It gets annoying quickly, even after turning part of it off in the options
-They also added some annoying confirmation sound for every piece of dialogue. I was never able to figure out how to turn it off and it wasn't in the original (original had some nice page-turning sounds)

Overall, this port is insulting to such an amazing game. If you have a Vita and don't mind the lack of fullscreen, just get the original game from the store. It's cheaper, anyway.

Design problems:

The stock itself is too small for most adult hands.  The spacing of the fore and aft grips isn't very deep.  This will put your arms into an uncomfortable position for playing.  The trigger is located on the front grip.  This is completely counter-intuitive.  This will force you to either hold the device in an unusual way or operate the trigger with your less-dominant hand.

You are forced to ""assemble"" the controller before use:

Remove a cover plate
Lock the Wii remote into the forward portion of the stock
Unlatch the Nunchuck cord holder (which is very flimsy)
Insert the Nunchuck
Feed the Nunchuck cord under the stock
Wrap the Nunchuck cord inside the stock
Relatch the Nunchuck cord holder
Cover up the wrapped Nunchuck cord with the cover plate
Feed the Nunchuck cord to the Wii remote
Figure out what to do with the dangling Wii remote's wrist strap (Nintendo doesn't provide any mechanism for this)

After that process you can finally use the glorified Wii controller mount.  Was that worth your effort?  No way.  Placing the Wii's controller in a gun-style stock is nonsensical.  Your sighting down the device in no way relates to the reticle's placement on the screen.  This is a limitation of the Wii's sensor bar.  It's a one-size-fits-all affair so it can't be calibrated very precisely (besides top of the set versus bottom).  The top (face) buttons on the Wii remote are impossible to use while the Zapper is in normal use.  You will have to hold it in an awkward manner to operate them.  The transposed ""B"" button (the trigger) seems cheesy.  It is sloppy in feel.

The pack-in game:

Soldier Of Fortune Payback for the xbox 360 is a First Person Shooter (FPS) where you play a mercenary that belongs to a company called the ""Shop"" they send you trekking to countries in the middle of war or small battles against small military rogue units. The action still has the blood and gore which the series is known for, that aspect of the game is done well. You can target specific body parts on enemies and when you shoot them they will react and bleed profusely. In addition to enemies bleeding you can blow their limbs off (their heads also explode like water mellons). Sometime the enemies can be wounded and they will automatically pull out their pistols trying to get a revenge kill... *in COD4 this is called a ""last stand"".

So Payback sounds like a solid game no? I bought SOF on the faith that it would be a good purchase because I have been a long time fan of the series. The last two games were considered excellent multiplayer games coupled with a decent single player story mode. Payback however, is a lost cause. And I was thinking to myself there was no way that the developers can make it worse than the previouse versions because this is afterall a nextgen title. They proved me wrong.

The graphics are worse. The character designs look outdated and jagged. the animations have a few hiccups with framerate. The enemy AI  whose only strategy is to run and shoot at you. They will rarely seek cover or try to flank you. There is no way the AI can employ much strategy against you because the game is very linear. And because of that very fact you don't have many options for tactics either. The worst offender for me though is that all weapons sound very much alike. from the shotguns, to sniper rifle, smgs, pistols and assult rifle. They used the same sound effects for all of the guns. Maybe the developers thought we wouldn't take notice of the identical sound effects...which is wacked!

Multiplayer is also lackluster, with only a handful of maps and even fewer game modes. The maps don't look bad but their sizes are much too big. Since there are only like four people online, You'll be hard pressed to find a full room of players and even with a full room, the maps feel much too big requiring players to search out each other for the fire fights. That spaciousness also creates moments without action and boredom. You'll also be hearing people commenting on the fact that the older Soldier of Fortune is still better than this itteration.

If I can convince just one of you people to save your money and not buy this junky game, then my mission is accomplished and I have fulfilled my new years resolution. Let's just hope that the original developers make a comeback and show us how it's done.

1.0,False,"01 10, 2012",A71ZGANVZDKAF,B004S5PBM0,christovt,"OK, first off, I am no musical wizard I admit it.  I play a few songs on guitar, and learn a new one or a new technique now and then, mostly from books or YouTube.  It takes me a while to learn new songs, maybe because I started later in life, don't know; I thought this game would help my learning curve but instead it leaves me wanting to quit guitar altogether.

I don't have a huge flat screen TV, and the words and instructions scrolling across the screen are very difficult to read.  The game comes with no written manual, so there is no easy way to figure out how to do something new without stopping what you are doing.

When I play through a song and miss what I consider a lot of notes, it still ""qualifies"" me for that song and suggests I move onto the next song or venue.  I didn't get the game to be a virtual rock star, and try and whip through a ""virtual career"".  In my mind I have ""learned a song"" when I can play it through, not get 50% of the notes and that doesn't seem to be what it's gear towards. It seems like it's possible to learn a song ""in spite"" of the game, not because of it. The rehearsal section as some others have mentioned is frustrating, and not very helpful for me.  A simple slow-down function would be much more effective for me.

It does adjust for ability, and adds new notes when you start getting better - but if you miss the new notes, you are back where you were before.  Tough to learn something new when you can't try it again. Again, being able to slow it down until you have mastered the new stuff and then speed it up would be most helpful.  I do not find the existing rehearsal options helpful.

Tuning ... every time you do something, it requires you to re-check your tuning ... over and over and over.  For example - I have to check my tuning before I rehearse a section of a song, and then 30 seconds later if I want to go over it again, it requires that I check my tuning again.  Would it be that tough to put a timer in, and have to re-tune only after 5 minutes or maybe the game could detect you are getting out of tune, and require a re-tune. My guitar stays in tune for days, but it doesn't matter - forced to re-check over and over, even though I don't have to adjust anything.

It doesn't label strings, or notes (even give you the option) so you're not going to learn that either. It's not even really teaching you to read tab.

Enough griping I guess.  Bottom line, I hoped it would help and encourage me, and instead it leaves me feeling wickedly frustrated, incompetent, having learned nothing new, and wanting to leave my guitar sitting in it's stand.  Obviously with all the positive reviews a lot of people enjoy it, and maybe it is helpful for them, but not for me (or possibly some of you).",Not for everyone,1326153600,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was expecting at least a little bit more of a traditional RPG with more realistic game play. TWEWY was far from what I expected. From the first time I booted it up, I thought ""oh no.. this looks cheesy - I'm going to hate this game"", but I gave it a chance anyway. After way too much ridiculous dialogue involving two characters that you can't help but hate, the game finally begins (sort of..). I finally got into the combat part of the game, which I absolutely hate. It feels like a mix of Dance Dance Revolution and Final Fantasy 2. You are expected to control two characters at once: one at the top of your screen, and the other at the bottom. On the bottom you run around in an extremely limited space using different attacks while trying to avoid the enemy. While doing this, you are expected to follow a pattern of buttons to push to control the character on the top screen, which I have found impossible, as I am not a chamelean and my eyes do not look in different directions at once. If you ignore the bottom screen for more than a second, you get bombarded by enemies. After trying to figure it out, I found it too difficult to resist the urge to destroy my DS by slamming it against the coffee table, so I just left the top screen on autoplay (which apparently the autoplay does a terrible job and makes it impossible to achieve higher than a C on any battle, which hinders game play.)

  So now I officially hate: the gameplay, the characters, and the combat. I decide ""Hell, 98% of people on Amazon loved the game, so lets keep going and try and see what they see."" I played a few more hours, gathered a few more ""pins"", and all I discovered is that 98% of people on Amazon are morons. I must say though, I hate the characters a little bit less. But I definitely hate the game much more. Boss battles have become extremely difficult because I have no choice but let the computer control my 2nd character - but wait! I have the ability to switch the game to ""easy"". I read reviewers say they like this aspect, but to me it's a cop out. Square Enix failed to make a consistent game and decided it would be easier to have us switch difficulties throughout the game than to fix it. In this reviewers opinion, Square Enix failed to make a tolerable game. I am surprised to see that anyone enjoyed it, and baffled as to how so many people loved it. Hands down one of the worst games I have ever played, and this is coming from a huge Square Enix fan.

As someone who is interested in the idea of using a sandbox game as a story-telling engine this game was a compelling purchase (though i still held off on getting it until i could purchase it for 3 bucks from the steam post christmas sale). Unfortunately after a few hours of playing it, i've found that what really lets this game down is the game. It over uses cut scenes (constantly usurping control), it handles like arse (regardless of your inclination to vehicles or being on foot) & the combat is ardious: Any game that requires me to pin point shoot a target sure as hell better give me a responsive enough set of controls to actually achieve the result.

But most damning is the fact that this game is not a open world sand box, so much as it is a rail shooter set on a open world sand box map. Apparently there are two ways to do every mission:
1. The way the game wants you to do it.
2. The way that restarts the mission so you can do it the way the game wants you to do it.

1.0,False,"08 27, 2016",ANP8TAQ78EK5U,B00ZQB28XK,E. Heidel,"Firstly, this is NOT a multiplayer game.

  In an exploration game, I typically expect usable maps.  You operate at 3 levels in the game, planetside (no map at all), local space (no map at all), and warp from system to system (map with very, very limited information).

  The planets, after a while, all look the same.  Minor variations, I grant you, but very minor.  This one looks more reddish, the next blue.  One has a crab, the next has a pile of goo for a critter.  This planet has a lot of water, this one is dry.  This one kills you with cold, or acid rain, or radiation (yes, many/most planets actively kill you).  Whee.

  There are aliens in the game.  However...  On a given planet or space station you might meet ONE single example of an alien race (as in one specific individual, never a bunch of one race wandering around).  At the start, you don't speak any of their languages, and you learn each one a single word at a time (so you end up seeing stuff like ""ahf lheqfb  afbo78 72l%^ minerals  kis hdfuo3"".  Get used to it.

  You are very limited inventory-wise, and upgrades to your equipment, rather than sensibly altering the existing item, actually take up an additional inventory slot (so, if your space suit, with say 12 slots, 3 of which are taken by gear, is upgraded to provide you more stamina, then the gear takes 4 slots and you have 8 to carry resources).  As an example, at only a few hours in the game, I had found 8 possible upgrades to my multi-tool (mining laser, weapon, binocs/bio scan, and area scanner, taking 4/5 slots); I could only apply one upgrade.  Naturally, swapping between them requires numerous resources on hand, and you don't get them all back (so you can't swap upgrades freely depending on the situation)

  Even though I often like exploring in games, and I absolutely love crafting, I found playing this game to be one frustrating step after another.  Your mileage might vary, but I would strongly recommend avoiding this game.","If I could get my money back, I would",1472256000,6,,

1. Weapons break, some with as little as 20 uses. If a weapon breaks you have to restructure your entire spells and skills section to accomodate for the new weapon elements.
2. You're constantly using different characters. There's no connection felt between you and the characters because you get a completely new party almost every single time. Build up your character and get weaklings again.
3. It's hard to tell what order you should select the events in. One minute you're 12 the other minute you're best friend of old age. Time in the game moves fast.
4. The game has some glitches that may make events unpassable.
5. The game has events that seem like super busywork. Areas that did nothing before trigger events. Some are almost impossible without a walkthrough.
6. The plot is horrible. It's boring, the character development is aweful.
7. It has quicksave but it forces you to use it. Some monsters in the game are nearly impossible and are everywhere in some scenes, like griffins.
8. The battle system is super annoying to learn. If you forget to unequip skills you end up not learning any, and you have to do stupid duels to gain stuff faster.
9. You're constantly fighting over and over and over. You're actions do not effect the plot, rather you're 'rewarded' with another tidbit of the aweful story after killing infinite amounts of monsters.
10. Some wars are nearly impossible and completely a matter of luck. In the wars you have armored guys around gustave it's impossible to lose. The whole war thing is a joke.
11. It takes like 10 seconds for the battle to start, between the battle transitions and you and the monsters fading in. It's not a lot, but after you've had like 5000 battles which the game makes you fight it's a kick in the teeth.

If you didn't like draconian DRM schemes, you're going to hate UBI Soft's new policy: you must be connected to their servers 100% of the time to play Assasin's Creed 2. If you don't have internet, or if your internet is out, or if you are on vacation, stationed in Iraq, or want to play at the airport, you are out of luck. No game for you. That in itself is very troubling and reason enough to NOT BUY THIS GAME. However, there are additional reasons that are even more frightening:

1) Setting the precedent for future games

If gamers buy Assasin's Creed despite this huge limitation on game play, it will open the door to many more games like this in the future. That would be awful for the consumer.

2) Turning 'owning' into leasing""

Tying games to some sort of server for activation is bad enough, but making them DEPENDENT on a server is horrible for the consumer. It takes away our rights (to play the game we paid for on our terms) and creates a system whereby you are simply LEASING a game. If at some point UBI Soft decides to take down their servers, you lose your game. They can take away your rights to play the game at any point in the future if they decided to. They have you by the cajones! If you give into this model, expect to never own any digital medium again; the makers of games, producers of music, and distributors of movies would love to see our current model of OWNING a physical copy of your game \ album \ movie replaced with a system where you only own the 'right' to access \ play that medium. It's their wet-dream to turn the current system of ownership on its head so they can re-sell you things endlessly as well as take them away from you at their discretion. As a consumer, it's important that we speak out against this by supporting DRM free games (Mass Effect II, Dragon Age, Fallout III, etc...) and DRM free music (buy it from Amazon!) and REFUSE to buy this junk with built in limitations and restrictions that SERVE NO PURPOSE.

3) Making games dependent on 'phoning home' means you're at the total mercy of UBI Soft (or whomever runs their servers)

If their servers are down, you lose access to your game. If their servers are overtaxed, you may experience problems connecting to your game. Think that isn't likely? Think again. Currently (03/09/2010) the servers have been down for the last 12 hours or so, creating chaos for all those who expected to be able to fire up Assassin's Creed. It doesn't even matter if UBI Soft is malevolent or not; if your service provider has a bad week you may be out of luck. If there is a storm in your area, you could end up out of luck for weeks (this happened to me when a tree knocked out my cable internet for 9 says straight--I thought I was going to die). You're screwed if your internet, their servers, or anything along the line between the two goes down.

4) DRM is pointless (and this online restriction is one of it's worst forms!)

Want to pirate games? It's tragically easy these days. Even more tragic is that DRM, supposedly designed to prevent piracy, is a total failure at actually accomplishing that. Want proof? Google ""Spore + DRM + Piracy"" and see what you come up with. I'll give you a hint: Spore was pirated BEFORE it was officially released. Many games are unto torrent sites well before their release date. The worst part of this is that the pirated versions are in almost all cases SUPERIOR to the DRM infested versions: they don't contain the invasive, crippling, and destructive DRM that past games have been ruined by (Bioshock, Mass Effect I, Spore, etc...). I am NOT ADVOCATING PIRACY. I think you should buy the games you want to play. I am advocating NOT BUYING games that violate your basic consumer rights (right to resell your game, right to play your game WHENEVER you want to without restrictions). If a game limits those rights, I say skip it entirely. Because UBI SOFT are morons doesn't give anyone the right to steal. As your Mom (or at least mine) used to say: two wrongs don't make a right!

I am not opposed to simple DRM schemes (disk check, or even Steam which has established very good rapport gamers by being both consistent, fair, and show a long track record of stability). I am totally opposed to anything that PREVENTS ME FROM PLAYING THE GAME that I paid money for. I don't want to see this standardized (and I don't think it will be) and so it's time to take action NOW and refuse to buy this garbage.

The bottom line is DRM is not and has never been about preventing piracy. It's about CONTROL. Control over you and how you are able to play the very game you paid your money for. It's about wrenching ownership away from the consumer and replacing it with something much lesser: rental \ leasing. Don't let them do that to you.

Final Thoughts:

UBI SOFT and those like them have got to be taught a lesson. The only way to get heard by these huge companies is by hitting them where it hurts: their pocketbook. Refuse to buy this game or games like it that infringe on your rights. Tell your friends not to buy it. Write reviews that inform people about the risks of doing so. That's how you get things to change. To the inevitable trolls who will tell me that DRM should just be 'given in to,' I'd like to point out that currently game makers are MOVING AWAY from DRM schemes. The reason is because of the backlash against pointless restrictions by those like myself who are unwilling to sit around and watch PC gaming be ruined by greedy scumbags. It's because of grassroots action (Spore for example) that the tide has turned and that DRM is now much less common than it was a year ago. Top shelf games are being released DRM free. You know what? I've bought all of them and recommend you do the same. Let's all give our money to the makers of games that RESPECT us--after all, WE ARE THE CUSTOMERS.

I was actually drawn in and impressed by Call of Duty 4, and even Modern Warfare 2 and World at War.  I feel so silly and nave now for thinking a few years back that maybe the series would push the envelope and be a bit more edgy by setting it in places like Israel, Sudan, or Southeast Asia and involve some people other than America and/or Britain constantly.

Instead, we get this garbage bag of insanity.

To get it out of the way first, the multiplayer is the same thing it's always been since COD4.  At the very least, it has female soldiers available now and I approve of this, as well as being able to customize your soldier (within reason) and upgrade them each individually.  Also, shiny graphics, much shinier than other COD games.

But the campaign.  Holy hell.  At the very least, there is/was a history with the US and Russia that could conceivably justify a war between those two countries (despite it being played out), but the main bad guy in this game is ""all of South America""

The idea that South America (apparently with Venezuela at the lead) would even begin to take hostile actions against the United States, whether now or 20 minutes in the future where this game is set, goes above and beyond insanity and stupidity, even more so than the route Battlefield 4 apparently took with the US vs China.  Apart from the fact that ""all of South America"" and the US are within easy driving/sailing distance, the Venezuelan economy is inextricably tied with the United States---nearly 40% of all their exports go to the US, and more than 30% of all their imports come from the US.

The idea that Venezuela would be able to overcome this massive reliance on the US to maintain its economy AND acquire a cornucopia of military hardware capable of legitimately threatening the United States within the next 20 years is FANTASY.

But the game tries to justify this by claiming America has been ""weakened"" somehow, allowing ""all of South America"" to become the next superpower.  Yet despite being ""weakened"", every other mission involves you, US soldier, deploying insanely advanced killing technology like drone strikes, remote-controlled snipers, and even a killer satellite to wipe out millions of non-white people.  Granted, this killer satellite is ""stolen"" by ""all of South America"" and used to attack American cities in the prologue, but its mere existence beforehand is just begging for some pack of buttholes to abuse it with horrifying results.  This satellite thing makes M.A.D. look tedious.

Considering the high level of realism COD normally likes to take with its ""modern"" war games, this sticks out horribly as cartoon fantasy.

And of course, much of the early action involves war with Mexico, with a gigantic border wall Republicans would wet themselves with delight to see being the center stage for combat.  And despite this, and occasional NPCs on your side having Hispanic last names, every character is a big burly white man.  Everyone.  Even the Big Bad turns out to be a former Ghost, in a revelation so insanely obvious that it becomes a plot hole to even treat it like a surprise.  Somehow the dirty Hispanics were able to brainwash a redblooded big burly white American guy just because his comrades couldn't save him from a life-or-death situation that would have killed them all, meaning this guy is either a massively petulant narcissist, or incredibly stupid.

And another thing; I enjoyed the atmosphere of COD4 Modern Warfare, in part because the characters felt professional---they used military terminology, had very little dumb chatter, very little clich-ridden dialogue, if any, and largely kept their cool under fire.  In Ghosts, it's the exact opposite in virtually every instance, and comes across like a bad Hollywood action flick than a military shooter.

Normally I like replaying certain COD campaigns, picking up Veteran-level achievements as well, but IF I ever play Ghosts again, I will never touch this steaming pile of moronic pseudo-propaganda that is the main campaign ever again.",Teabagger's wet dream,1389657600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The game has you go through really tough things, and really boring environments. The hard part of the game is really the backtracking. I never needed a strategy guide, but jeez man what is this. Once I got underground, I had to backtrack like 8 times.
So the second to final level had me going under lasers again. After I narrowly got by the lasers, I had to go on a catwalk to a small room. There was no cover across the catwalk, and it was easy to die. I ran across for my life to the room which was to the right of the catwalk. Right when I step in the room a missle comes at me and I lose all of my health, and my place. I had to restart from before the lasers.
The games mechanics are fine, the bots are boring though. The longer you play, the more times the nuclear bomb thingy goes off. It went off once during my whole time, and that was right before getting to the underground.
The game itself is boring. I hated bactracking, and I hated how the enemies always had the upperhand. It was relatively easy somewhat, but powerups and life refills were hard to find, so alot of the time I was at low health, knee deep in baddies.
Again, the backtracking is horrible. But also the lasers. My gosh, you have to avoid these lasers on a roof and at the second to last level. The lasers are HARD to get by. You have to do split second reactions.
You can only save once a level is complete, so get ready to make commitments. You can't reload from continues so you better finish that level.
Again, I hate this game for making the second to last level so hard. Honestly, keep the level of difficulty at medium. How hard is it to make the game easier. Koei decided to make all that time I spent worthless, o and there was no way to beat the guy with the rocket launcher unless I had thousands of health, or a cheat on.

With almost unuseable menus and 37 commands put into the Dreamcast controller, it makes the game a REAL pain to learn and makes it barely playable.

My brother got duped into buying this Destiny and we found it is nothing but a cash grab.  The game updates making your previously purchased content obsolete.  The upgrades to enjoy the entire game is expensive to the point of being redicious.  This would have been killer awesome had it been developed with a strong solo componant.  If you have every bell and whistle connected to a sony system you will like the online multiplayer game at least until the next money grab requires you to upgrade again to continue playing a game that is not worth the continual upgrades.

Destiny comes with certain content and features which are taken away by updates to the game and you must spend $19.99 to recapture functions you had.  Sorry but in my humble estimation this Destiny is the biggest cash grab rip off I have endured since Dead Space 3 which was made by the same company.  It is getting so I won't buy Activision Products because; the game you spend $60 for is more and more just a shell that you must continually plow money in  renewing features of games that are not really that great in the first place.  I know I won't get any love for this review but what I shared here had to be said.  If I lose my top reviewer rank for this I'm cool with that.  I believe gamers should get value when they spend $60 on a video game.  There is no way Destiny is worth the $60 they charge.  Even at $10.00 Destiny would be way overpriced because you are expected to shell out so much more additional money for in game perks and DLC.

Destiny put all its hope in being a great multi-player game and the game infrastructure for a robust online gaming experience just was not there.  Add the steep cost of additional Destiny chapter DLC from a game that is not really that good and there is no reason whatsoever to buy this game.  I am really sad Desiny did not come with a solid solo game because; the controls were first rate.  The story was third rate to begin with and you learn nothing unless you go to the Destiny website.

The game play of the origninal was not that great for a PS3 generation game but the story in coop mode was simply great.  Breaking into jail, the night club scenes were epic.  Dog Days simply had no story.  The guns seemed better and the game play better, but from scene to scene, the story was incoherent and I lost interest.  When the game ends, me and my friend said ""what...that was it?""  The campaign was short, like real short.  My friend and I are experienced FPS players (but have a life outside of video games) and we beat the game on hard difficulity in about 4 hours, which is ridiculous.

Hit detection is poor for human players but excellent if not unreal for AI. I mean you die with two bullets. There is no scope on guns and no grenades; you throw canasters instead.

in the installation folder, rename sshock2.exe to sshock2.old
find and download SystemShock2_xp_2000_fix.zip
copy the exe from the above zip file to the installation folder

in the installation folder
open shock.cfg with notepad
at the end of that file, on a separate line, add this: safe_texture_manager
save and exit the file

Windows XP boot.ini changes (BE CAREFUL!)
go to control panel, system, advanced, startup and recovery, settings
click edit
add the following line under the [operating system] section:
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS=""Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game"" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /numproc=1

save the boot.ini file
reboot
when prompted, select the ""Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game"" option

Windows boots like usual
play the game

After you play the game through to its ending, be sure to remove the ""numproc=1"" line that you added to boot.ini.

I haven't played a Sonic game since Sonic Adventure, and I grew up with the original series on the Sega Genesis. In fact, Sonic 2 was one of the first games I owned...so I had fond memories of this series, although I had been oblivious to the development of more recent titles.

I couldn't believe that it could be THAT bad, so I ended up purchasing a copy for 5 dollars at a local swap meet to sate my curiosity. This would turn out to be the worst 5 dollars I ever spent. After playing the game for about four hours, I couldn't take any more. Rather than continue playing it, I turned to youtube to watch and see if the ending was any better...as I simply did not want to play any more of it myself.

From a gameplay perspective, Sonic team truly botched this attempt. The camera is horrible, and controlling Sonic has never felt more sickening. Sonic can no longer rev up for a speed boost, and his movements feel jittery. Because of poor control, dying is common and frustrating because of the game's absolutely absurd loading times. I would predict about 10% of this game's length could be entirely loading screens...no joke.

The presentation is equally horrid. There's a lot of bad level design here, as even the hub worlds are way too big and difficult to navigate. Sonic and his friends are all here, poorly rendered and animated. Disturbingly, Sonic team decided to place these odd, furry, mascots alongside realistic looking human beings. If that weren't bad enough, Sonic even has a ""romantic"" relationship with one of these humans. The contrast here is jarring, and somewhat disturbing.

The story is absolutely insipid and the entire thing feels like bad fan fiction. The only fortunate thing is that the ending, which I looked up online, completely retcons the entirety of the game as if Sonic team knew before the game was complete that they wanted this to be forgotten.

In summation: Obnoxious controls, extremely long load times, a poor save feature that can make you lose lots of progress, bad level design, horrible presentation, awful story, and a literally forgettable ending...

Yeah...this game is horrible. One of the worst games ever. Period. If you were a fan of Sonic in the old days, this game will only destroy your fondness for the franchise.

The main issue is the screen protector. First off, if the screen isn't in its locked position, the case WILL NOT CLOSE without damaging your psp, so it must be locked. When it's locked, it's jammed and can't be opened without some sort of metal prying tool.

After prying it open the first time, I decided to give the case a second chance, placed my psp inside, locked the screen protector in place and closed the case.

Fortunately, time has moved on, technology has improved and games like GTA: San Andreas have proved all this can be achieved - within limits (there's a reason the graphics are kept basic). Unfortunately, Activision weren't told this and have improved on NOTHING (in fact, the shooting element's WORSE)!

The shooting's bog-standard - hold L1 to lock-on and tap R1 repeatedly 'til everyone falls down - with a fleating attempt at some 'Hollywood-style' diving around, which is laughable. The fighting's cumbersome, and near-impossible if you're attacked by more than one person. And the driving is a joke. Rating bars display the differences between the various vehicles, but every one of them is slow to respond to any control input (and you'll marvel at the distance covered by a parked car when you glance it at moderate speed).

The controls are the major problem affecting everything. They are badly set-out (with no option of changing them) and slugish, making everything you do, however you do it, a chore.

However, I have to give this 2 stars purely for the map. The recreation of Manhattan is stunning! In a fast car, covering the island from north to south can take well over 10 minutes (assuming you're skilled enough to weave through the traffic without incident), everything you'd expect to find in the real city is there to be found and the inclusion of the useable subway is a nice touch (especially considering the scale). The map also evolves depending on how you play the game - solve crimes and the citizens will be affable, litter scarce and buildings clean; ignore crimes and the citizens will be testy, the streets litter-strewn and the buildings covered in grafitti.

Unfortunately this also creates another problem. Being a fan of Spider-Man 2, all I wanted to do was climb to the top of a building, jump off and swing through the streets, exploring, but since you're stuck to ground level, it never feels like you're fully appreciating the city.

Last year they added a new skating engine, which changed the dynamic of the game play but wasn't enough to warrant a purchase. This year however, the upgrades are significant and worthy!

I have played over 20 games online and about 50 in single player, checking out the various modes and whatnot, so I have had ample time to witness the minor and significant changes firsthand.

A brief rundown of the pros and cons:

Pros:
Nice graphcial upgrades to crowds, animations, and arenas
New hitting and deke controls are great
Lots of improved modes
New fighting mode is actually fun
Cleaner overall menu and presentation
Crowd AI is superb and react accordingly to the action on ice
The most authentic arenas yet in an NHL game

Cons:
Looks too similar to '13
Still cant take your offline Be A Pro online
EXACT SAME (Annoying!)COMMENTARY
Not enough overall new-ness for some
NHL94 mode is gimmicky and CANNOT BE PLAYED ONLINE!!!!!! (Ridiculous, but its fun if you have a bunch of friends to couch play with)

Regradless of the cons, I still think this is a buy, even at full-price, because of how much fun the changes have made the gameplay. This is easily the best NHL game of the series and it strikes the absolute perfect balance between sim and arcade hockey! You can put it on High Impact play mode and go crazy with the checking and massive slappers or choose Hardcore Sim and play a game that is almost too realisitic. But the default is just right for the kind of game I like. Exciting, fast, and brutal but realisitic at the same time. They really nailed the gameplay here, I cant stress that enough!

All in all, this is a fnatastic package for both newcomers and series vets like myself. I highly recommend this years edition. The series has never been this superb as a whole package. Its very fitting that they have such a legendary player on this years cover, and I have been very critical of EA for the handling of this series. This year is a MUST BUY! And I rarely say that about an EA game. Also of note is that this years gamre WILL NOT see a release on the new X1 or PS4. NHL will debut on those with NHL 15. This is one of the reasons I am waiting til then to get one or the other.

UPDATE: 2/6/2014

After hundreds of games online and off, I must admit that the online experience is very sub-par. Part of it is the horrible community (for the most part) and the gameplay lag issues. EA servers obviously suck, but there are a TON of trolls online that like to ruin the games. I have frequently seen goalies playing out of the net, people scoring on their own net, unresponsive players for entire games, etc, etc, etc, etc. I have seen it all, reported it to EA customer service and through their forums. It has become sickening and I would NOT recommend letting younger kids play this online. Its like the Call of Duty crowd decided they wanted to play NHL this year. Its way worse than the last few years thats for sure.

The technical issues are ridiculous as well. The AI that takes over when someone drops out is absolutely atrocious. Soemtime goalies are supermen, other times computer goalies look pitiful and let anything by. Yuo STILL cannot boot people who are either unresponsive or being trolls. The lag causes serious issues with the animations. The new animation system is dependant on a fast net connection, which I have Time Warner Speed Boost 50 mbps. But even that snt enough when someone your playing with has less. Thats where the servers come in. Find me a good connection with other similar players. There are also a ton of cheap exploits that crop up everyday. It has really gotten unplayable and this is the first time I really am going to trade in ym copy. I am done with EA sports.

First off, it has the longest install process  of any game I have ever played, and I have a 48x CD-ROM drive. Second, the  interface is monstrous, even though it looks elegant and simple. While  positioning ships is easy, (and it should be since they only move in 2  dimensions), there is no real sense of scale, plus they have a tendency to  `bump' into objects like space stations and other ships. Secondly, the  instant they see an enemy ship, any vessel you control within weapons'  range automatically opens fire, taking interaction down a notch. Also  unlike Homeworld the user cannot assign formations to his ships, making  dispersement messy.
 When the game starts the user is treated to a  rather nicely rendered opening scene with lots of fleet action between  Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Borg vessels that culminates on an all-out  run on Borg Cubes. (Though one wonders how Picard can face down Locutus  since they are the same guy. Did the Borg clone Picard?) Unfortunately, the  game doesn't deliver anywhere near the excitement generated by a 3 minute  opening segue. At the title screen you have a choice to play a series of  missions as either the Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Borg and they all  must be played before arriving at the finale mission. Overall, the game  seems to have been slapped together to capitalize on the franchise, lacking  both the quality and substance that LucasArts has put into their Star Wars  line of games. Armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like Homeworld  or even Starcraft. If you changed the space scapes to ground and the  starships to Zerg or Protoss units, Armada would be Starcraft, except not  as much fun.
 Armada prolongs the Star Trek game curse when it should  have shattered it. The prospect of moving a fleet of Defiant and Sovereign  class starships around the screen should have been an easy game to create.  Perhaps if Activision had optioned the Homeworld engine for Armada, things  would have been different. However, on the upside, the rendered starships  do look nice, as does the 3D lighting for all of the effects shots. Getting  Patrick Stewart, Michael Dorn, and Denise Crosby to do voices will probably  get die-hard Trek fans to purchase the game to feed their pirana-like  frenzy for franchise merchandise, but style should never win out over  substance in a game like this.

2.0,False,"11 28, 2015",A2KP4CWYUTKUFO,B013GMXA2I,Herschel Greenberg,"Corsair makes some excellent gaming products. For example, right now I am typing on their K70 Mechanical Keyboard, and I love it. I had high hopes for their gaming headphones, the Void RGB USB PC Gaming Headphones.  In the end, they did not live up to my expectations.

Sound:
I do not know why, but every gaming headphone I have ever tried on always sounded muddled, muted, and unclear.  This included various Turtle Beach, Steelseries, and now the Corsair headphones.  I expected crystal clear sound from a supposed 7.1 setup, but I really did not like it. For comparison, I also own and use regularly the Sennheiser HD558, which are not gaming headphones, but can be used for anything (they lack a mic).  The sound out of the Sennheiser HD558 is crystal clear, robust, and all around you. The Corsair sounds like they are under water, which is what other gaming headphones sound like.  I tested the Corsair on many types of music out of Google Play, and several games, including Borderlands 2, Dying Light, Lego Jurassic Park, and Rocket League (I tried to use a diverse set of games).  I can honestly say that the sound experience was subparmy normal PC speakers are Klipsch THX Promedia, and they sound significantly better. I do not think I heard any additional sound effects, such as enemies approaching from behind, which is the reason most gamers want 7.1 surround sound in their headphones.  And since the Corsair comes with no software out of the box (I now see some kind of Corsair Utility Engine on their website, but I do not know what it does for these headphones), the only thing I could do was adjust the sound volume in Windows 8.1.  If Corsair came with an equalizer, that might help some of these issues. Overall, the sound did not meet my expectations.

Comfort:
Headphones are a hit-or-miss for many people, since everyones head and hair are different.  When I first put these one, I did so as I would any normal headphones. The headband was placed across the top of my head. Within seconds, my ears hurt.  I was ready to reject them instantly. Luckily, the little booklet it came with shows a picture, and the headband is NOT supposed to go across the top of your head.  The headband needs to go on the front of your head towards your hair line. This will angle the ear cups correctly. Once I figured this out, they were much more comfortable. You need to know that these are over-ear cups, so they will create a seal (they are not noise cancelling, but they will block out a great deal of noise).  Overall, they were comfortable for about 30 minutes, but I can imagine with a longer break-in period, they will be comfortable longer.

Design:
The design looks solid, but there is one thing that is already driving me crazy.  The ear cups rotate on their own axis. If you hold the right ear cup in your right hand, the entire piece will swivel up, allowing you to look inside the ear cup.  I am not sure why Corsair designed it this way, but they swivel with absolutely no resistance. I tried to stretch the headband before putting them on, and the left ear cup swiveled out of my hand, and the entire thing snapped back into my chin. I understand that some swivel helps the headphones sit on different type heads, but they swivel in crazy directions every time I touch them. Maybe Corsair did this so that when you put them down, the ear cushions face up instead of down. Overall, I do not like this feature.

Misc:
The mic is permanently attachedyou cannot remove it. At least the Steelseries can be retracted.  It is rubbery, and I can always see it when they headphones are in use (it cannot be pulled up high enough in my opinion).  In addition, these are truly PC headphones because they can only be connected via USB.  You need to know thisthe Voids cannot be used on a cell phone or a stereo receiver out of the box.  I have a laptop with no more free USB ports. Luckily, it worked through a USB 3.0 powered hub.  For some people, the lack of extended functionality will be a deal breaker.

Overall:
Although I like Corsair, I did not like these headphones. I would rather plug in a normal pair of high end headphones to my audio jack rather than use these as gaming headphones.  Although they are comfortable once you put them on correctly, I do think they are as comfortable as they could be where I could wear them for hours of gaming. I dislike that the ear cups swivel so easily and so often, and dislike the fact that the mic is always attached to the headset. I would recommend you try these one somewhere first, and listen to the sound before making the decision if they are right for you. They were not right for me.",Not as good as I had hoped,1448668800,,,

Fast paced, whoever sees the other player first gets the kill. Not buying the expansions and probably not playing more of it beyond on occasion. The vehicles are suck. I have only seen the attack chopper on one map. You buy weapons and find that most of them suck and then it takes 90 to 120 kills to unlock their attachments to buy if you bother. I never used my pistol more than once in over ten hours of playing because it is so fast paced that you would never need it. The level design on some maps is fairly cool but the sped up mechanics make it impossible to strategize like in the old battlefields and therefore it's kind of a waste.

If you're just going to use the 360 for DVDs, menus or purchases, you can use the remote entirely, skipping the controller completely!  But the X1 remote isn't quite as useful.  And, I'm shaking my head at some of its design choices, which range from just sad to flat-out irritating.

I'm okay with it having fewer buttons. The number buttons won't really be missed. But there are functions I miss across the board: no buttons to access the DVD/Blu-ray menus, no ABXY buttons, no power button, no Display or Info buttons.  I actually used those with regularity.

So what buttons DOES the remote have?  Well, it's hard to tell, because there are no English labels on ANY of the buttons.  All you get are icons.  Some are self-explanatory, like Play/Pause, Stop, Forward and Back, because those icons are the same on almost every device.  But many of the others range from ""oh, I get it"" to ""what the heck is that?""  I know that the X1 is sold in many places, but I'm not a fan of the recent trend: companies shifting from supporting one or multiple languages to supporting no languages at all.  I'm sick of having to decipher confusing, meaningless icons when one or two words could have given me some actual information.

The buttons illuminate, which is nice.  But when they aren't lit up, the icons on each button are a dark grey on black.  Unless the room is well-lit, they are barely visible.  If the room is fairly dark, you won't be able to make them out at all.  So before you can actually press a button on the remote, you have to tilt or shake it, which causes the buttons to light up.  If you were going to pick up the remote anyway, it doesn't matter, but if you just wanted to push a button while it's lying on a table, you're out of luck.  Oh, and when the buttons light up, they don't stay lit for very long...it's a mere 3 seconds before the light starts to fade.  It does not appear that the amount of time can be adjusted.  So you may have some trouble even if you're just trying to stare at the icons to figure out what they do.

Despite all of this, I can still find some pros. It's one of the smallest remotes I own, so there's something to be said for that.  It is nice to be able to manipulate the X1 without waking up the controller or having to use voice commands, which are convenient but not always as easy to use as physical buttons.  The most essential functions--pause, play, skip forward--work just fine.

So as a somewhat-functional remote, and an alternative to the most basic voice commands, it's a success.  But if they released an updated, more useful version--or simply allowed use of the 360's media remote via a firmware update--I'd toss this thing in a heartbeat.",Wish I could use the 360's media remote instead,1397606400,,,

This game is bad. So bad that I will keep it short and sweet.

Graphics:  I really could care less about graphics but I know it is a major selling point for some gamers.  Too Human has beautiful ""large"" environments.  I say ""large"" because the levels seem huge, with backgrounds that go on for days but you are basically confined to halway size paths that you run through and repetively slash at enemies.

Character equipment designs are gorgeous.  Facial textures look laughable on some characters though.  Mainly Baldur himself.

Sound:  Sound along with equipment design are the only 2 stars I will give this game.  The musical score is good and so are the sound effects.

Controls: The right-thumbstick controls are controversial.  I see what the designers were trying to do and in fact the combat controls seem to work, however a totally broken lock on system breaks the controls.  You will litteraly have a GIANT 2 feet in front of you.  Tilt the thumbstick in front of you and there's a good chance you will forego this behemoth to target some random midget that is minding his own business 600ft away.  This is inexcusable. This problem is compounded with a horrible camera system.  Forget about using the default camera and pull back to ISO mode. Even ISO mode, however, cannot save you from camera seizures that happen when you try to turn a corner or even turn a 180.

Gameplay: Ok this is where I could rant forever but I will try to be brief.

- Game is made of only 4 ungodly massive levels.

- Combat is broken by the camera and lock-on system

- Character classes are totally unbalanced.  Certain classes are dying machines.  Imagine playing an MMO, where every class has a purpose in a team concept but there is no team, only you (maybe one friend online)

- Speaking of online, it is broken as well.  The enemies level to the highest lvl character in the group. So.. I got my game a week before my friend.  I reached level 35 he was lvl 15.  We figured the game would find a happy medium to scale the baddies to. WRONG!!  Every creature was lvl 38+. Resulting in my friend dying every 2 secs.

- Pointlessly boring cyberspace quests.

- Bosses have way too much health( GARN especially)

Story:  The story is pretty bland with bad voice acting and dialogue.

+ For choosing Norse mythology instead of Greek or something else that's been run into the ground.

- For choosing Baldur as the main character when you have Thor and Tyr as supporting characters.  Baldur is so sissified that his mother had to beg everything in creation not to kill her son but he ends up dying at the hands of the only thing she thought harmless enough not to ask.... MISTLETOE.  :(

- The story could be compeling but nothing is explained.  The designers must have figured that Norse mythology is the #1 religion in the world and everyone knows it like the back of their hands.  Nothing is explained only refered to.  Characters are introduced with little to know backstory.  The story in this game basically sucks because of presentation.

So on a final note, there is a lot of complaining about the death scene.  It is there to mask the loading/game over screen you would see in any other game.  I actually think this is a good idea.  The bad part of it is that  you will die so many times in this broken game that you will see the valkyrie animation 100+ times.

I personally believe the series will continue but I digress. Before Rocksteady leaves the Batman Franchise they release a Season Pass that promises 6 months of content. Enjoying the game and having never been disappointed by Rocksteady I bought on sale for 32$ from the PSN store. Well Rocksteady has officially disappointed me. It has been 3 months and half of the promised content has come out and it has been lackluster.

Let's start with the what a majority of the this content the skins. The skins are well made including some for the Batmoblie, but its not worth the price of the season pass. You don't even get all the skins some are WBplay exclusive. Which given the price and absolute lack of content its ridiculous that they can't even give you all the skins. Challenge maps have been added which should have been in the base game and once again the content is not worth of the asking price. The straw that broke the camel's back was the story missions. When I played the Batgirl DLC and beat it in 2 hours and this was me collecting the collectables and doing all the challenges. It only gets worse Harley Quinn and Red Hood story missions even shorter lasting 30-45 minutes. The new Nightwing DLC is the same as Harley Quinn and Red Hood which I was lenient on because they were pre-order bonuses. The new Nightwing DLC has no excuse.

The season pass is too over priced its content is not worth 40$, hell its not worth the price I paid for (32$). If the Season Pass was 20$ I would enjoy it more, they shouldn't have charged more than 25$. Which is why I can not recommend anybody buying this at full price. Wait until its 50% off or wait for a GOTY edition which is pretty much inevitable.

+ Funny Jokes, Characters, Features -Some of the jokes in this game are great. Beating up your caddie when your [upset] (when your composure is low), is a terrfic feature which def. added to the positive side of this game.
+ Easy Controls -The first time you play it, I can almost bet that you will have the controls down in a matter of minutes.
+ Multiplayer -The multiplayer for this game is good. What I truly like about it is that you don't have to have 4 controllers to play against 4 people. All you need is one controller which allows  all the players to use. Also, another good aspect about multiplayer is that it offers different types of golf modes to play.

With moderate use, the controller stopped working after about 2 weeks. The left stick constantly sends a ""right"" signal. Both sticks began sticking in particular positions. For example, after pushing the left stick to the right, it gets stuck there. So disappointing.

I tried opening a ticket on their site, but it just leads to a page with the support phone number. Calling that number, I only had to wait on hold for about a minute.

- Load outs
Just like Call of Duty (COD), you select what you want your primary/secondary weapons to be, what type of grenades you want, etc.

This will depend largely on the size of the map and if you can expect long, mid or short range battles. This is relatively disappointing, as it hurts gameplay. For example, if a newbie goes with an Assault Rifle load out on a larger map where a more skilled player would go with a DMR, and they meet up in close quarters - the newbie would win. Not because he's a better or smarter player, but because he doesn't understand why his loadout is the wrong choice. Essentially, the better player is punished for making the right decision. Competitiveness and skill should revolve around an equal playing field - not load out weaponry advantage.

My opinion: Save load outs for COD. If load outs were a good thing, we would have seen them in h2/h3.

- Drop Pods (aka Care Packages)

Just like in COD, you have kill streaks. Once you reach a streak, you get to call down a ""Drop Pod"". These contain a choice of weapons or abilities. There are several weapon spawns in game - but must of the weapons will come via your kill streak drop pods.

My opinion: 343 decided to fix something that was never broken. Again, if ""care packages"" were a good thing, we would have seen them long ago.

- Special abilities

Jet packs, holograms, thrust, hardened shield, invisibility cloak and the new ""Promothean Vision"". If I could remove anything from the game, special abilities would be it. They should have died with Reach. They're yet another circus-like feature that removes elements of skill. For example, if you're shooting someone below you from a higher point - backing away to save yourself is impossible when they have a fricken jet pack. Or, what about crouching to avoid detection? A hallmark of Halo. Gone! With Promothean vision, you can see anyone, anywhere. Cool feature for campaign, lame for multiplayer. I wouldn't call jet packs, holograms or Promothean vision an element of ""skill"". Just the opposite.

My opinion: More circus-like features - lame attempts to satisfy newbies that need special abilities to increase their kill count and balance themselves against better players.

- Ranking

Gone! What ever happened to the H2/H3 ranking system? I thought we were done with the obviously failed attempt at ""league"" type ranking with Reach that no one ever played. Yet, here we are, and Halo copies COD once again. Now, you just play to you're blue in the fact earning ""points"" to buy armor and unlock more abilities and weapons.

My opinion: No longer is Halo a fun game of skill and competition. Now, it's like COD. All about garnering as many points as you can by killing people so you can keep unlocking things. That's why everyone in Reach/H4 just charges into battle. Their performance doesn't matter - there's no consequences for being a bad player, other than not ranking up as fast. At least with H2/H3, players were matched via their rank/skill - not how many kills and points they have.

My opinion: Bungie/343 saw that catering to skill wasn't very lucrative. So, they became tools of the newbies. No rank, no real competition, everyone ranks up with points and kills, everyone gets drop pod weapons, everyone gets a special ability. If there's a way to deter serious gamers - they've done it!

Multiplayer requirement: Before you can even play multiplayer, you're required to have 8GB of free space. 343's reason for this is ""Halo 4 will push the limits of the Xbox 360 in terms of visual and audio fidelity, and will be delivering significant post-launch content."" This would be fine (and make sense) if 8GB was actually being used. No, only 3GB is being used. To my mind, this is a ploy to get everyone who owns H4 and a 360, to buy an HDD if they haven't already done so. I find this extremely shady and I pretty much lost all respect for 343. There's really no excuse for forcing people to spend another $60+ on storage space that isn't even being used, under the premise that the person is even going to purchase the ""post launch"" content that isn't even out yet. How lame is that? If you have to buy an HDD - buy used.

[CAMPAIGN]

Compared to COD and other titles, their campaign is much better. Especially in terms of graphic and effort they put into the story line. However, the campaign in H4 was nothing to brag about. Not as good as H3 and nowhere near as enjoyable as H2 and CE. 80% of the campaign is going down identical space ship corridors fighting mainly Prometheans. It gets boring and repetitive.

The most exciting time in the campaign comes at the end when you're about to battle the big bad boss (Halo's version of ""Bowser"" from Mario Bros). Nope - he just falls of the edge and the game is over! Games like Mario Bros and Legend of Zelda have become legendary classics because their gameplay consisted of a clever hierarchy of ""bosses"" that increased in difficulty as the game goes on. With H4, you have none of that. You fight the same exact units the entire game. There's no increase in difficulty - more or less just an increase of enemies. That doesn't make things more difficult - it just takes longer and involves more hiding behind things to not get shot.

All in all, the campaign felt short, repetitive and not very enjoyable. The story line showed a bit of effort by 343, but there was a huge disconnect between it and the gameplay - which had no effect on how enjoyable it actually was.

My verdict: I'd recommend H4 to those who like Multiplayer and already have an HDD that they require. Those who like COD will probably like H4, as it's pretty much the same thing - just 1,000 years in the future. I really wish they'd go back to their roots and make Halo unique like it once was, but that's not going to happen and there's really no alternative games that can fill the void.","Halo 2, Where Art Thou?",1352592000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I almost gave up and ordered one off eBay from China, until one popped up at a good price. Looking back, I may have been better off ordering the knock-off from China as it seemed to have better contours.

This one's made by Cyber Gadget, and their other grips are wonderful. At least their later ones. I own one for my 3DS XL and it's my favorite grip out of them all; it's almost as good as the most comfortable controller. The PSP and 3DS XL grips are made from the same rubber-like material.

What makes a good grip for me is having a fat eggplant shape so your palms can extend out the back of the handheld, and legs/arms/handles that stretch downward, this way your hands feel like they're holding a controller rather than having them scrunched closely to the sides of the handheld, like you weren't holding a grip at all.

This grip has excellent construction, no doubt, like any other Cyber Gadget grip, but it's missing one crucial feature mentioned above: the eggplant shape. This means that, while there are arms hanging downward, my hands come into a rather awkward and unpleasant position. I've had to train myself to hold the grip as if I were holding the PSP by itself, with my palms resting on the arms, except now I've got nothing for my fingertips to hang on to. So they curl back in toward the PSP. That would be the end of it, except the right handle, as you can see in the picture, has a cut out to make way for the power slide, but it didn't need that much chunk taken out. So what that means is that my right hand is a lot more uncomfortable than my left.

It sounds weird describing it, but that's how it is. It's still better than using the PSP by itself, and the mechanism for tightening and loosening the PSP is fantastic (there's a little knob on the bottom that unscrews to let you slide down the bottom and insert the PSP), and the back opens and snaps just fine to remove and insert UMDs. It's just not as comfortable as other grips.

  Ahem, but I get ahead of myself. ""Shadow of the Colossus"" is certainly unlike most games I've ever played. You start as a...man (boy?) who is trying to resurrect a...woman (girl?). You journey to a forbidden land to speak with the Dormir (dormir is Latin for ""sleep"", by the way), who are...spirits(?) who can raise the dead. They propose a challenge - defeat 16 colossi roaming the land, in order to destory 16 idols in a vacant temple. And thus, your story begins. And...that's pretty much it, to this point. Each time you defeat a colossus, you return and hear...that you need to defeat another colossus.

This is a minor flaw, however, and the countryside is both vast and lush, with green forests, blue lakes, excellent shading for light and dark, etc. If you want to get a good idea of how great these graphics are, you need only observe the fine detail of your horse's tail. I mean, these graphics are incredible (for the PS2).

  As far as ideas go, this game has a good one. Rather than bore the player with the tedium of mindless monster encounters which do little but tire your thumbs and fingers, there are exactly 16 enemies in the game (not counting the optional lizards, which can't really be called enemies, anyway). And each battle is epic - the colossi each have weak points to be exploited, but it's up to the player to figure out how. Much of the time, a player will have to climb a colossus (who generally have fur/moss to grip) and stab it, but getting there is all the challenge. I love the battles in theory...

However, in execution, there are numerous problems. The first is the horrible camera. Rarely does it move where you want. And while one CAN lock onto a colossus, I have found that often, it is detrimental to the player's chance of defeating the titan. Also, the character's running motion is incredibly awkward - one cannot easily run away from a colossus, out of the screen. This makes battles that SHOULD be easier much more complicated (although I haven't found any yet that are particularly challenging).

Controls are gummy, particularly when controlling the horse.  Climbing colossi is more difficult than it should be because the character often gets hung up (you try to move sideways, but he wants to go up). The horse is a nightmare all around - his speed is controlled by spurring, but it is erratic, and he always slows even in a slight turn. This makes overworld travel rather painful.

And that's a problem, too - while no overworld enemies saves a player from the boredom of fighting 100 green slimes, it unfortunately adds to the frustration when a colossus cannot be found. Riding on the horse will fray the nerves of many, and you'll be doing it a lot.

The music? Not bad, but nothing special. And even if it WAS great, it is so sparse as to be forgettable despite its greatness. You will get music while fighting colossi (and it is helpful - a change in music usually means you're on the right path to defeating the giant), and a small theme each time you enter a colossus' realm, but that's it.

And we end where we began. I have no doubt that this game has a great story - somewhere. Unfortunately, it has developed so slowly that most will give up before they see the payoff. I'll stick with it, because I enjoy the colossus battles, but it isn't surprising that some people don't see what the hub-bub is about. I surely don't...at the moment.

All in all, an intriguing idea mixed with good gameplay, great graphics, mediocre control and zero story (at least through 7 colossi), and you pretty much have a dud.","I haven't completed the game, but...",1177459200,9,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'}",

The game is laugh out loud funny, but that is the only good aspect. It contains at least 3 different games, two of which are awful. But unfortunately even for a game this short, they all get boring and repetitive.
The Stewie part is a basic platformer where you will shoot enemies and jump around. It has brief moments of greatness, for example the under utilized mind control ray. But these levels, especially after he gets shrunk and voyages into a person, are repetitive and bland.
Brian's part is a stealth game and is just terrible. Did you ever play games where you have to memorize the pattern of patroling units like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metal-Gear-Solid-2-Sons-of-Liberty/dp/B00005ML10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a>? If you did you may remember it being frustrating and you probably failed many times. Literally that is the entirety of Brian's game - a different room with different guards over and over again.
Peter's part is a basic smash-em-up, with a slight twist. You can kick and punch (also some special moves) but enemies will only be vulnerable to one of those two. After a few scenes of this it gets real old and the fact that it is hard and repetitive don't help.
There are also mini games. These are the flashback, ""this is worse than that one time when..."" part of the game. They play out similar to Warioware games (where you get a second or two to figure out what to do and then go), but are not essential to the game - if you win you get a bonus (collectable items, temporary power) and losing doesn't cause anything negative. Generally these are usually funny or at least random.
Even with all of the diversity in gameplay this is short and repetitive - way too repetitive for a game that takes less than 10 hours to complete. The saving grace of the game is the Family Guy style of humor. They reused a number of amusing things from the show as background. There are a lot of funny moments like Jesus flipping out because he got the wrong color of M&M (he knows he can change the color, its the principle), Peter dressing up as A.N.N.A. & Brian's Peanut Butter Jelly Time costume, Marco Polo with Helen Keller, and the evil pointing monkey in Chris' room, but ultimately this is a game and not an episode.

At first it was pretty good, I game a lot and after a week I thought it was a great purchase. It matched my Red Dragon keyboard (which is still awesome in my book) and the mousepad I was using at the time. So not only did it look cool, but it functioned just right. Thing is, it was much lighter than the wireless Logitech mouse that I was using. The quality of the Logitech mouse however somehow didn't compare to how cool and comfy this wired mouse was. Then I came into a problem that was a huge deal breaker. A week later (which is actually today) I find myself regretting this purchase. It's really bothering me too. You see, as a gamer I find myself right clicking a lot, much more than a casual user would. And while I still had no issues with left clicking, the right clicking became unbearable. You see, it developed a kind of resistance to right clicking as if it needed to be broke in. It's hard to explain, but i'll try my best. While you left click, there's a very short period of time of when there isn't enough pressure to fully click, but enough to move the plastic just a miniscule amount. That's with a lot of normal mice. but it kind of had a little crackle to it. I swear if this were just a bit bigger you could hear it squeaking. Kind of like when you lean in an office chair and it squeaks that way. It sounds like no big deal, but after a long gaming session, it will become so extremely noticeable and you'll be extremely annoyed. You just put a little pressure and you'll feel the crack. So long story short, it's worth it as long as you don't game on PC for long periods at a time. If you do, and you find yourself playing something that involves a lot of right clicking, hope for the best. But if you can help it, get something a little higher quality.

2.0,False,"08 1, 2004",A26PAN8REXYBYH,B00008KA4E,Brian M. Ranzoni,"I've never considered myself a real-time strategist. Since Westwood's seminal *Dune II*, I've beaten about every major RTS on the American market. Yet game play hasn't evolved enough to sustain my interest.

 Same goes for turned-based strategy, though I've been clicking ""Next Turn"" since the original *Civilization*. These too, have stuck by the formula with insufficient innovations to maintain replay value.

 So when PC journalists began to herald an RTS/TBS revolution last year, I took notice. Developer Big Huge Games and game `zines alike trumpeted a game to bridge the gap between the excitement and mechanics of real-time war games with the scope and sophistication of turned-based empire builders.

 Folks, I am still waiting. In the meantime, I received Big Huge Games' *Rise of Nations*; beneath all the hype it's a disappointingly conventional RTS.

 From the get-go, it's necessary to sort game from advertisement. Favorable reviewers all around have gushed some variation of the following:

 1. *RoN* is a sophisticated RTS.

 2. *RoN* is an epic RTS.

 3. *RoN* is a hybrid between RTS and TBS game types.

 4. *RoN* is a sophisticated, epic hybrid between RTS and TBS types.

 While I haven't tested these claims online, my single-player conquests invalidated these claims.

 *RoN* rigidly adheres to RTS tradition. Gameplay confines to the B3 principle: Build bases, Build units, Blow up. The developers include a Risk-style ""Conquer the World"" mode which offers raiding party actions, but otherwise missions are solved by building a base, amassing resources, and then smashing a computer-controlled base with a large, clumsy army. Like most modern RTS games, *RoN* offers rudimentary diplomacy, research, and economic features to upgrade your forces. Likewise, it offers a choice of combatants distinguished mainly by military power and texture skins variations. Finally, *RoN* arrays stereotypical unit types and superfluous gimmicks... like most RTS games, the player will quickly learn that building a bunch of tanks and rushing the enemy base works most of the time.

 *RoN* rushes with Blizzard-style play mechanics founded back with the original *Warcraft*. Players use a central building to generate labor units, units who mine a small range of archetypal resources from battlemap hotspots and typically hoof them back to the central building (though *RoN* mercifully permits players to build collection camps on-site). Players then spend these resources by ordering labor units to build factories, laboratories, and fortifications around the central building. Each has its own build queue for military units, and/or unit upgrades as well.

 Bases are not sprawling, well-defend affairs as in the Westwood model. Fortifications lack sufficient range and hit points while costing too much to build; discouraging base-camping and encouraging aggressive play. One usually wins by destroying selected enemy buildings. A 200-unit population cap per player constrains their entire infrastructures.

 Frankly, I find this game-style dated. That doesn't stop Big Huge Games from trying to adorn their product with trappings of the turned-based empire genre. *RoN* notably introduces a ""library"" of additional building and unit upgrades. This library also improves caps and modifiers for resources, and improves the next notable introduction, national borders. National borders act strictly as a weapon, by inflicting ""attrition"" damage on any enemy unit or building caught on the wrong side of a shift. Per *Civilization*, a number of ""wonder"" buildings unlock special powers and modifications. And the players can advance through levels of technology called ""Ages"". BHG emulates Stainless Steel Studios in offering peaceful technology or resource races as an endgame option for skirmish and multiplayer modes.

 And that's it. Big Huge Games might call its combatants ""civilizations"", its labor units ""citizens"", and its bases ""cities""; in practice it's still the Blizzard RTS military model. The intricate tech trees of the *Civ* and *MOO* series are here trimmed down to lines of yet more unit upgrades. Borders have no cultural or political purpose-they just act as a force shield. Economy is still a shallow matter of collecting resources and uncovering crates to build powerful armies. Missions are limited mostly to combat, the non-military options being woefully underdeveloped. Yes, *Rise of Nations* is straight RTS, no more sophisticated than *Starcraft* or epic than *Empire Earth*.

 With *RoN* put into perspective, I can see its virtues more clearly. It's a fast-paced entry into the ""historical"" genre, for those who want to upgrade armies from the stone age to modern times in an afternoon. A plethora of civilization-specific units and advantages lends a style choice to whichever side you play. BHG keeps base buildings to a minimum, and players can immediately build all units available for a given age, so long as they have the resources and the factories. Resources are widely available and players have plenty of room on each map to spread their bases and amass armies. BHG also incorporates good unit AI and path-finding. If the player doesn't want to worry about an extended campaign or story-line, *RoN* is all about skirmishes and multiplayer.

 Perhaps as much as the hype these traditions fail to please me. I'm tired of the arbitrary 200-unit population caps and mindless B3 routine. Westwood games may be even more dated in their play mechanics, but at least they concentrated each game on a story and well-executed themes, instead of developing a loose collection of skirmish variations beneath a thread-bare claim of being ""historical"".

 BHG could have broke the mold; the idea of a true epic RTS is one of the great unrealized ideas in PC gaming. They played it safe instead-but had the gall to call it something it is not. Make no mistake; dedicated RTS gamers will probably love this game for the same reasons I dislike it.

I got it and started to play it and I loved it, I was like YEAH! another True Crime, but then after the first 5 minutes if gameplay it turned into crap. It was kind of like the creators put all there effort into the first five minutes of the game then they were just like ""alright lets finish this already."" The first five minutes of gameplay are non-stop actionu are in a warehouse killing all these gang members for revenge or something with these two sick Uzi's, BUT THEN a cut-scene happens and all of a sudden alakazam......its crap. After the cutscene you are a cop and it is two years or something into the future and you and your partner are set to go on a mission. You drive there and your partner walks in alone and the whole place explodes. Your cop expectations go down and now oyu must work your way up doing dirty work. Thats basically the whole game, doing dirty work and its not fun at all.

  Probably the most fun out of the game is just running around on foot, because the driving is horrible, and arresting random people and showing them your badge and shooting your gun in the air. Everything else sucks. The story-line missions are so boring and pointless. All you do in the story missions are go to this random guy and get told about this bad guy who needs to be in jail but its your job to figure out where he is. So the random guy gives you a list of poeple who might know something about the wanted bad guy. So you go to a warehouse and kill everyone in it and make the person tell you something about the wanted bad guy and then you go to another warehouse and do the same thing about three or four times till you have found enough info on the guy to take him out. Then once you have got that guy the random guy gives you another guy you need to find info about. And thats over and over till the story missions are done, sounds boring...right? Well it is! There are side missions but they suck and are also boring. Like doing missions for your father or taxi missions and racing missions.

  The environment is horrible, now i know New York city is awesome and what not, but NYC sucks in a game, like really sucks. First of all the place is so freakin huge that if oyu want to do a mission you have to drive for like five minutes just to get to the person who tells you the mission. Then you have to drive to where the actual mission takes place which is another five minutes. This will keep you from doing the other missions because you will be like....eh i don't want to drive all the way there lets just do this misssion. The car crashing is also horrible. When you crash you most likely do a 180 degree turn, which gets really annoying when you are in a cop chase. Also the place is just boring, its the same looking buildings over and over again and its like never day and ther is always garbage flying across the screen, its like a dump.

  OVerall the whole story-line sucks. Basically because there is no specific storyline. The game jst feels like someone regular, normal life, the normal life of a cop. The sound sucks too, especially the cars. When you crash it is the most irritating noise and the cutscene volume is so low while the gameplay volume is super high. So you will turn up the volume while in a cutscene and forget to turn it lower for gameplay and your ears will blow out from the noise. The controls are also bad. Since its like just based on a normal life of a cop you are able to do all the normal things making you use all buttons on the controler. I mean the back button  shoot in the air, now when is the back button ever used except for menus. The fighting stile is cool but it kind of gets confusing with all the buttons you have to press.

  You are able to do all the same things as the first like badge showing and arresting and fighting moves and shooting in the air. Really the most fun i have in the game is driving at full speed in a car and when someone does that stupid thing, like in all games, where they change lanes and get infront of you to make you crash; so i slam into them from the back and then make them get out of the car and arrest them, because in all other games you can't do anything about it, like GTA.

  Overall this game is bad and not what it could have been or should have been. I would not recommend this game to anyone, its just so bad.

But my time is too important to waste on mediocre games, and this is definitely one of them. I played through to the end, and outside of some decent ""on rails"" scenes on a river and in a rail car, the only other above-average thrills were some cutscenes of adult content.

This was called a horror game in some reviews, but it was not scary. It doesn't even really try to be. Story-wise I was never so certain that a game was about to end, then find it slog on for another few scenes of play. This frustrating and confusing phenomena happened over and over as the story kept awkwardly lurching forward.

The gameplay is very stale and redundant, with weak and inconsistent AI. Sure, you can stealth or tank through boards, but there's no real reward or pleasure in doing either. The game does not encourage you to explore new weapons or styles of play, as I didn't use many of the guns in favor of the 3 top pieces and finished with a horde of unspent money. There is no reward system to grow or evolve your character, so killing people at the end is virtually the same as in the beginning.

Oh, and there were three instances where the game would glitch, then autosave the glitch, so that reloading or continuing you'd be stuck on that same glitch. The only remedy would be to restart the entire section, sometimes losing up to an hour's worth of play. This infuriating thing has never happened to me on any other game I've ever played.

The ""drab post-apocalyptic ruins"" setting is the most overdone in all of video games. There should be a moratorium on this subgenre of action games.

Forever Kingdom does improve upon the original in several ways, but not enough!  The improvements are a bit like taking a step forward, then a step back.
The biggest change is the new three-character party.  You can switch between Darius, Ruyan, and Faena, which is cool.  What isn't cool is those three characters share a single lifebar.  When one gets hurt, the other two get hurt.  This makes no sense whatsoever;  you get all the aggravations of a single-character system with none of the benefits a party system should provide.  What's the point?
To be fair, the special combo attacks all three characters can perform together are kinda cool, since they are very damaging.  However, the execution is so poor as to make it a moot point.  The environments aren't very detailed and the combat is quite simplistic.  I expect better crafted environments for the PS2, this looks like a first-generation game.  The ""music"" is the worst I've ever heard in a game.  Imagine 3 different orchestras playing 3 different tunes simultaneously, that's what this ""noise"" sounds like!
For those who liked Evergrace, this sequel probably won't disappoint.  But for the rest of us, there are better RPGs out there.  The story is pretty good and the puzzles are challenging.

I play video games to have fun.  This game was anything but fun.  You are so worried with staying alive throughout an entire level that there is no fun.  The easiest level of difficulty in this game was way too hard for me.  I was constantly dying or having to use artifacts to stay alive, it was ridiculous.  I stopped playing this game at the final boss battle of level 2, because I couldn't beat it.  Yes, level 2.  There are 14 levels.  I can't imagine the boss from level 14.

Other than the difficulty, I hated that I needed to search out power-ups, artifacts, ect.  I just want to go through a level and kill a bunch of people. Is that too much to ask?

And while it seems to do a great job of theming the game up with transformers, it never really feels like Transformers to me. It feels like an action arcade game with Transformers slapped on it really really well. But transformers never fought like this or were in high speed adrenaline chases. Thematically I think transformers would be a better rpg game or adventure game. In this game we have Optimus floating in air while doing attacks and flinging his vehicle self at robots. So while they do a great job at trying to make the theme apply it never sticks, despite the really incredible character models and voice acting.

The game itself is bland. I feel like I've played games like it back on the n64, just much slower, but with the same amount of camera angles, depth, and lack of thought out features. For instance, I tried to change the difficulty level and it warned me it would restart the chapter. It hadn't actually introduced chapters at that point so I assumed it was check points, and this ended up making me restart the game. The game isn't fun. It's repetitive. And the levels are boring, ugly, and visually empty as if it were designed for ps2. If you are a transformers fan I feel you are much better off playing the high moon studios games, despite it not having the amazing G1 presentation.

If I had paid $5 for a copy of this on a cell phone I'd still feel ripped off, that's how bad it is.  The gameplay is mediocre, the controls are awful, the graphics and sound are disappointing.  The game has very little polish overall, it plays like something that was developed over the course of a few weeks with no chance to smooth things out before shipping.

Graphics: 1/5
The textures are low-res, the colors are bland and washed out, the polygon count is so low that it looks like a Playstation 1 game.  In this day and age, I'll bet that even an amateur could whip up better graphics in a few weeks.

3D: They put ZERO effort into making things work well in 3d.  You don't realize how much work it takes to make 3d look good in the theaters until you see what you get if you don't have that manual polish.  This game will probably give you a splitting headache if you try to play it exclusively in 3d, because things randomly pop way out of the screen right next to things that are deep behind it, and the environment rapidly fluctuates in and out along the Z axis.

Sound: 1/5
The music is SUPER DUPER LOUD, drowning out ALL OTHER SOUNDS completely.  I can't even rate the sound effects and voices, because I couldn't hear them

Gameplay: 3/5
The overall game seems decent, it's pretty rough and unpolished (example: It's hard to know exactly where you're supposed to go a lot of the time, since the low-res, low-poly walls blend into each other and hide paths you're supposed to take)

Controls: 1/5
Expect to spend more time fighting the camera than the bad guys.  I gave up about half a painful hour into the game when I had to climb along some vines on a rock wall (actually they looked more like a smoothed and stretched out 40 pixel x 40 pixel texture on a completely flat greenish wall), and I kept falling off to my death when I was supposed to hop from some vines to some other vines thanks to the unpredictable controls

Conclusion:
This is a bad game.  Honestly, it's one of the worst games I've ever played.

2.0,False,"08 23, 2006",A12RYA1QNP9HOG,B000FDOTN6,V,"Yep...  I said it.  Everyone seems to have the same ideas and views that I've been saying for years now.  I think one of the other reviewers put it best: ""Buying Madden every year is like getting a new calendar - yeah, technically it's 'different', but in the end..."" well, you get the point.  This review is a little long, but since I don't think I'll be doing another one for ANY EA title anymore - as I won't be buying them - I wanted to cover everything that I could think of, in case anyone is (like me) a longtime player and customer.

EA has effectively eliminated all competition by purchasing the NFL license - no need to push the envelope by putting out innovative and fun quality products now.  Hell, they're bold enough now to even take Madden out of the 'Madden', so why are some surprised that other features are gone??  (RIP 2K Series...  you were the best) But who's really to blame - the companies, who obviously are in this to make $$$ (and doing a good job), or the fools out there in line at midnight (saw it on the news - how retarded is that??) throwing all that $$$ away every summer?  Me - I hate everybody in this equation equally...

I really wanted to like this game.  I REALLY did...  In the end, I think I received it in the best possible fashion - got it as a gift.  Just can't see paying $60 for roster updates - that's essentially what this amounts to.  Yeah, it's supposedly better than last year's version (which I hadn't played on the 360), but it's now just as good as MAYBE '05 on the regular XBOX.  Why are we settling for moving backwards - ESPECIALLY when we're talking about the 360?  Why are we so excited over possibly getting to a point that WE WERE AT 4 YEARS AGO?  (Use the gas-price analogy if it helps you understand why so many people are pissed:  You get excited now when you see gas prices at $2.25-$2.50, even though you were using the same or better quality gas for $1.10 or less a few years ago.  Same general principle here...)  Because people b***h and moan, but EA can count on them to be in line at GameStop or WalMart on release day, with hard-earned money in hand, hoping they won't be disappointed this year.  PRAYING that THIS is indeed the year.  No.  EA knows this.  (Yeah I can talk - I stopped purchasing Madden in '03 when I realized that they were more interested in that little ""#1 Selling Football Franchise"" tag in the corner of the game box than in keeping their customers satisfied.)

Overall, the graphics are nice - decent is maybe more accurate.  I play this on my 62"" HDTV... the perfect setup for those sports nights - this game just seems to fall a little short to me.  Even my wife said, ""This doesn't look like it's by the same people that did the boxing game."" (Fight Night Round 3, which we love - the only thing keeping EA afloat as far as I'm concerned) Don't get me wrong - it's not the worse game by any means.  (I disagree with the review that said it was like Gameday '99 - that's a little extreme.) I don't need the jerseys to get dirty, or care if I can actually see the field get torn up as I play...  it would be NICE, definitely.  Don't know why we CAN'T have that, but anyway...  There was some detail put into the movement of the faces and all - I can see the effort there.  Whoever said that these were spot-on, accurate representations of the real NFL players must have been smoking something highly illegal.  These are detailed faces indeed, but of very ugly people.  Cracks me up, actually...  and why is everybody ridiculously cut on this game?  My punter is the same size as my LB??  Is Balco in on this game too?  I'm willing to deal with mutant players and the lack of certain other details.  I don't think we should have to settle for average overall games though, especially with a title as established as Madden.  Definitely expecting more from a system that's supposedly more powerful than any home computer you can get.

Gameplay is familiar; same running patterns, with a few new animations - still choppy and unrealistic, even on the ""mighty"" 360.  Who do I have to talk to about getting some gang tackling on here??  Jesus...  it's 2007 - this should've BEEN a part of Madden by now.  ...but I digress.  Button configurations are overly-complicated...  the menu interface is probably more confusing than it needs to be, but you kinda get used to it.  (much like a rash)  Camera views, particularly in the Superstar Mode, are absolutely horrific.  As a QB, you can't see a damn thing on either of the sidelines.  I guess it's still a decent idea, but I much rather play the Superstar Mode from last year on the XBox - who really thought that giving players the ability to play as an OL was the one element that was missing from the series, seriously??  The idea of only controlling your 'Superstar' annoys me...  I guess it is realistic in the sense that you only control YOU in real life, but in a video game?  Nah...  I'd still at least like the option to control the entire team on offense and defense.  Glitches?  The Fatigue button is a joke, and doesn't work realistically.  (I mean seriously doesn't work - to the point where there's a patch in the works to fix this.)  Why is such a hyped product still having MAJOR glitches before release, and still being rushed into stores??  Another thing - I unlock a Mr. Barry Sanders... not bad.  But why does he automatically end up on another team (in this case, the Panthers) throughout the course of my Franchise?  You have absolutely NO SAY in what happens.  I don't like that.  Again, this isht should be ironed out before the final product is released.  I'm not a fan of patches and quick-fixes - you get enough of that dealing with a computer.

Gameplay interface still allows for ridiculous ease: beat the CPU 87-3 on All-Madden, my Bears (87 points??) against Indy with 5 min quarters. (Of course, an 80+ point deficit in the 4th quarter didn't deter the Colts from ONSIDE KICKING after their sad field goal...  why does this STILL happen on every Madden game?!?!)  First time playing - nothing new there.  All of the little gimicks and everything wear out their welcome by game number 4, because at that point you've seen every (and I mean EVERY) item and animation this game has to offer.  Remember 2K4 and 2K5, when you still found new stuff, or heard new commentary/saw new animations like 9-10 months later?  Yeah, me too...  (sniff) Another gripe of mine (maybe small to some) is the music and commentary.  I know NO ONE, even die-hard Maddenites, could say with a straight face that Madden's painfully obvious play-by-play could be mentioned in the same breath as the 2K series', but I actually MISS Mr. Madden in this installment.  The radio announcer thing... no.  Doesn't work.  Music?  Well, I know everyone has their different tastes, but I'm not feeling this.  Considering this is the 360, why don't we have more control over what music is played, and when/where?  True, you can have your saved music playing, but guess what?  It just plays continuously throughout EVERYTHING.  (Compare this to the original XBox - on NFL 2K5 you could not only choose the individual songs you have playing, but assign different points in the game - after touchdowns, long drives, turnovers, etc. - that the particular song would be cued.  You could even pinpoint a particular moment in the song and have it start from there!  For my money, nothing was more fun than listening to Lil' Jon scream ""WHAAAAT?!?!?!"" after a big sack or Truck-Stick hit.)

You can say I'm nitpicking, but is it really, on a $400+ system?  Why do we have to wait until Sony comes out with the ""competition"" (or arguably superior product - PS3) before MicroSoft actually cares enough to put out what we - as consumers - deserve for our money?  If EA (and MicroSoft, for that matter) would like to get back some fans and loyal supporters (Yes EA, your NBA Live series sucks too... what the hell happened to you?!  Those previews look promising... but so did Madden/NCAA 07.), they should offer - instead of ridiculous prices for garbage - maybe roster update/new feature patches for the 360.  If you subscribe to XBox Live Gold (which isn't free), you should get this for no fee.  If you don't have the Live connection, you should be able to download it on a computer and put it on a disc or something - charge about $15-$20 for this.  I think that would be fair.

If you HAVE to buy the new version every year, then you'll go and get this, or already have.  If you love Madden for whatever unrealistic reason, you'll find a reason to love this game, if only to defend your choice to purchase it.  Having played Madden since SEGA GENESIS, I'm expecting more.  For you Madden-heads out there whose hearts hurt when you read a negative comment about Madden, stop being so damn sensitive.  Do you need a hug or something?  Did your sister or son make the game?  No?  Then don't take it personal. These are MY opinions of a game that I own.  Stop reviewing the other REVIEWS, and put your honest comments about the actual product.  If you like it, then put why.  (Other than the fact that you may secretly be Mr. Madden's lovechild)

I love the story, the dialogue, the graphics, and the overall aesthetics of gameplay design & combat. What I didn't like was that 2-weeks after I paid the full price of $59.99, the game was significantly discounted down to $39.99. This was due to the launch of Blizzard's incredibly popular title: Overwatch. Worst still is that the game has major issues with online multiplayer. You'll be lucky to find anyone to group with in the match making queue, if you plan to play past North American prime time hours.

The game now sells at most major retail stores for $19.99 presently, and you can find it for less if you look around. The unfortunate thing about this game is that too many people compare this game to Overwatch, and they're not really much alike honestly. While each game has it's pros & cons, Battleborn feels like it has more depth in it's gameplay. This game has a lot of strength to it's gameplay at the core.

Sadly, the game appears to be in the final stages of it's death throws (presently), unless the developer can make this title Free-To-Play - in order to breathe new life into it. This would hopefully allow players to repopulate the online servers once more. This is a game that I majorly regret purchasing, and I feel like I've wasted my money entirely on a title that will now never live up to it's full potential.

It was the first computer game to bring a great PC version of a popular RPG to fruition.  I also played the Black Isle/Bioware versions of the AD&D series (Baldur's Gate & Icewind Dale) and loved those games.  But this one?  I think my review would be censored if I told you what I thought of this game.
First of all, the game crashed on installation!  Blizzard may be the only software company that releases relatively bug-free PC games these days but how can a software company justify a game with bugs in the installation process?!  I've heard that I have it lucky.  Some people have had their operation systems wiped out in the installation process.
After getting the game to run, I was unimpressed.  The graphics are decent but it doesn't have the same atmosphere as the other recent Dungeons & Dragons products.  It's a ""hack and slash"" only game and things such as quests, great storylines and character interaction which made so many of the Dungeons & Dragons games enjoyable are non-existent in this product.  The instruction manual is also a poor substitute for an introduction to the new 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons rules.
I'm afraid that the more I play this game, the more technical errors I'm going to find.  There are already many bugs such as the game crashing when you save it during certain conditions.  I can live with a bugged game if it promises to offer great gameplay when it is fixed with patches but this game is a pitiful attempt to live up to some of the great successes the Dungeons and Dragons series has seen with PC games.
Don't waste your money.  If you're an avid D&D fan, wait until the game price drops and then try it out but I'd recommend Baldur's Gate II as a much better alternative if anyone desires a great RPG game for the PC.",What a waste of money!,1001721600,4,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

First off, the controls are stupid, on the N64 they are easy, and you know what you are doing, on the playstation they are confusing and plays more like an arcade beat 'em up then a wrestling match. And I really hate the way you do specials in this game.

The Create A Wrestler was the first thing I tried out, it's ok, but too confusing, the lists are too long and numbered instead of telling you what it is. I couldn't even find a DX shirt to put on. The music is pointless as it only shows about 5 seconds of the titantron before it cuts to the next bit, I couldn't even find half of my fave. moves, yet there in the game somewhere and you can't even pick a height, you just have tall or short instead of the actual stat.

But what really bugged me about this game is season mode. It's confusing to even start one, but it is frustrating to have to have to go through every match of the show either watching it or simulating it, i try to skip them all to the match i'm in, but it takes too long with annoying music and then takes longer to load a pointless scene saying, ""whoever, had entered the building"" ... big deal, why did they do this? why not just do what has been done with the other 64 games and just go from your matches next to next instead of wasting your time having to simulate every other match, with no way to skip ALL events till your match, or have you spend about 10 minutes simulating through a show that you're character is not even participating in.

2.0,False,"12 6, 2004",A1UL2JH7XOUGM5,B0002X7Y2C,Ruined,"Half Life 2 could have been an all around excellent game.  Unfortunately its flaws bring it down into the levels of mediocrity for many players.

First off, let's start with the bugs in this game.  No matter what brand processor, motherboard, videocard, or soundcard you have, no matter how fast your system is, there is a very good chance you will suffer from crashes, sound stuttering, and frequent 5-10 second freezes in this game.  There are many things Valve will tell you is wrong with your system that is causing the problem, but in the end it is a problem with their programming of the source engine - which has some unforseen compatibility problems with a wide spectrum of hardware.  Valve has still not delivered a satisfactory patch addressing the bugs in the game.

Next up is inefficient shader programming.  Though the game runs beautifully on modern Nvidia GeForce 6600/6800 videocards, at max detail, buyers with older cards are not so lucky.  If you have a GeForce FX 5200/5600/5900 card, you will be forced into using a lower quality DirectX 8.1 mode even though the GeForce FX supports DirectX 9.0.  This is because Valve coded the shaders inefficiently, and failed to use partial precision (FP16) in their game unlike all the other DirectX9 games available.  By using a mixed precision path, which Valve stated would be in the game and benchmarked over a year ago, they could have made DirectX9 available to owners of older GeForce FX cards.  However, much like the rest of the game, the graphic implementation here appears rushed, and again we have less than desirable results for a large amount of people.  So don't expect anything approaching the best quality unless you have the latest $300 videocard.

But the disappointment does not end there.  Most games you type in your CDKEY, hit install, wait a 10 minutes, and you are done.  Not Half Life 2.  After doing the initial standard 10 minute cdkey/install, you then have to install a program called steam on your hard drive and setup an online account.  This takes another 10 minutes.  After you have setup the steam account, you then have to wait for the files to be decrypted on your hard drive.  This takes about 30-45 minutes for the games on the CE.  So now you are talking an hour+ just to install the game.  You think, boy, after all that, it must be real easy to play, right?  No way.  You have to keep the CD in the drive like any other game, and on top of that you have to launch the steam program, wait for it to connect to the internet, then you can play Half Life 2 - every time you play the game.  There is a hassle you can go through to play HL2 offline, but you still have to install, activate, and decrypt the files on steam at least once.  Major, major, major intrusive pain in the rear that no buyer of a retail CD should have to endure.  This is a case where anti-piracy measures have hurt the consumer more than the pirates.

If you are not fed up with the game after the long and intrusive install, the missed opportunity in terms of graphic performance, and the bugs that may bring your game to a grinding halt on a frequent basis, then you may actually enjoy this game.  But that's a *big* if.

Proceed with caution with this title.  What could have been a great gaming experience has been marred by sloppy general programming & bugs, inefficient graphics programming for older graphics cards, and a horribly intrusive and painful install procedure that persists past the install and into your gameplaying experience.  If you think you can deal with these issues, this is definitely a cool game.

Cooper,"Like many fans of the original Bioware epic Neverwinter Nights, I was giddy as a schoolgirl when we approached the release of Neverwinter Nights 2.  Perhaps the fact that it was constantly delayed should have been a warning, but I wasn't deterred at all and was travelling all over the city on launch day trying to find a copy of the Limited Edition with rings that don't fit and an art book.

But let me digress for a moment...
Bioware was the creative studio behind the epic hit Knights of the Old Republic, and Obsidian's only prior game as a studio was Knights of the Old Republic 2 which was lauded for its excellent story, and bemoaned over its incomplete nature and buggy unfinished feel.  Neverwinter Nights 2 was Obsidian's second title, and also their second continuation of a Bioware masterpiece, and ultimately the foreshadowing of what was to be released should have been heeded by those of us who were chomping at the bits to get our hands on it as soon as possible.

Obsidian released Neverwinter Nights 2 without the DM client, despite the fact that they had been touting the fact in interviews a year prior that the online component of the game was well in hand.  On the contrary, the online component of NWN2 was in shambles, and even after multiple patches over the course of 2 years now has the online component stabilized... to a point.

When you play online with the latest patch, you still get load screen freezes, the game crashes every time on exiting (Vista and XP), and it appears to have enormous memory leak issues which have not been resolved.  I am not running a weak machine mind you, I'm running a dual core 2 duo 8400 (Wolfdale), 4 GB of RAM, and a 64 bit operating system, with a 512MB Geforce 8800GT... a powerhouse which crashes consistently with NWN2.

I had the same problems on my prior system, an AMD core, with 2GB of RAM and a 7900GT and XP.  Multiplayer freezes your computer or crashes the game randomly.

Let us be honest... the Multiplayer component may not be what sells the game out of the gate, but it is what makes the original NWN a hit even in the present time (6 years post-release).  Multiplayer was incredibly unfinished by Obsidian, and reading the release notes it is almost criminal how they acknowledge bugs, don't know what causes them, and don't issue any timeframe or even a plan on an expected fix.

This game hasn't worked since release for those who enjoy Multiplayer.  Single player is buggy, but the campaign is good (reminiscent of KOTOR2).

Despite all this, the cash cow milking is at work, and Gold Editions, Platinum Editions, Diamond Editions, etc. are promised features and fixes for those who shell out cash to buy the newest bundle or expansion.

Obsidian/Atari should not be planning any expansions until the game actually works.  Instead, they are financing development and running the license into the ground because of the shortsighted nature of development.

This game was supposed to be a D&D fan's dream, but many of us are moving back to NWN where Bioware still adds free content, fixes, and additions to the game despite not making much money off of it.

Perhaps Obsidian/Atari should slow down on milking the consumer and think about what breeds customer loyalty.  I've bought every single Bioware title to date, and I will continue buying because I get what I expect - quality, and a finished game.

Each role seems at least reasonably compelling, as far as the story itself, although why some of the background actions (like the opening war) are not always clearly or believably explained.
Story 6.8/10

Odin Sphere has been widely praised for its ""beautiful 2D graphics"". Yes, a lot of work has been done including crouching and looking up, but that doesn't save it from looking the same a LOT of the time. There is a great deal of repetition in the moves, enemies, and areas that draws down what should have been a pretty game.
Graphics 6/10

Sound effects and magic sound appropriate, and you can choose either English or Japanese dub from the start and change that at will from the in-game options menu. However, you can't independently alter voicing or effects. Limited options pulled this score down for me
Sound 6/10

Some of the music is pretty, but the majority of it is the ""barely there background"" type. When I have game music, I like to notice that there IS music rather than it being usually indistinguishable from silence. No options for volume leveling pulls down the score a little.
Music 5.7/10

Despite there being minute differences between the characters (some characters take longer to use items and eat food), and having nominally different weapons (spears and swords). However, the areas are the same circles and actual game play consists of the exact same 'swing, swing, pause for action gauge to refill, repeat' that got tiring before I finished the first character. It's also extremely easy to be interrupted from attacking or using items - if a boss hits you while you're trying to eat a bun, you drop the item and lose MORE health, and typically are stunned on top of that. Frustrating, not fun. The fact that characters share maps and you'll be running around the EXACT same areas many times does not help.
Gameplay 3/10

You can replay cutscenes, but as repetitious as the game is you likely won't even want to play the other characters, much less come back to replay the rather linear greater play.
Replay 4/10

It looks nice and it has both dubs to serve your preferences, but the sound and music seemed lackluster and the frustrating, boringly repetitive gameplay was a quick and consistent disappointment. Rent before you consider buying.

3. There is no real ""assassin"" play techniques.  Need to kill a target?  Simply walk up to them and use your hidden knife, no one will be the wiser as long as you don't stand at the murder scene.

Even better is once you master the counter technique for sword fighting, you can take on huge groups of guards with very little chance of death.  Farther into the game you are required to dispatch entire groups of guards, once again dispersing the entire assassination theme.  Also, don't even try to assassinate the main bosses, it's a waste of time since the game always forces these huge group battles.

The icing on the cake is the fact that the story does very little to wrap up at the end and leaves you wondering what in the world is going on.

I bought this to be able to hear game sounds while my husband sleeps; we have a ""proper"" full-sized PS3 headset that plays game sounds, but it weighs fully one hundred pounds and hurts my neck to wear.

However, it turns out that this headset is ONLY for online chat -- you can hear yourself and others speak through it, but no game sounds whatsoever will come through. I wish the current marketing blurb would actually make that clear; maybe they'll update it soon.

So, to be very clear: This is *not* a PS3 headset in the sense that you can hear games. It only allows you to hear other players. If that's what you want it for, it works fine.

There are a myriad of XBOX 360 games that come out that you never hear about or even care to try, until you find them used for less than $10 bucks (or in this case, less than $5!).  So, for the money I spent on this game - I think it's just great.  Sure, it's just another 3rd person shooter thing that plays similar to Gears of War, but is that a bad thing?  I think it's just great!
The graphics are good, but muddled.  They are colorful and well made, but kind of, muddled?  I don't know how to put it.  It LOOKS like a first-gen game on the 360, I guess.  It's no slouch, though - there are no glitches or pixely areas.  It's plenty nice to look at.
The controls are OK - takes a little getting used to but overall it's no different than many others out there.
Gameplay is repetitive, but you know, I like it.  Sometimes I just wanna shoot stuff and clear levels!
For what I paid for it, I think it's excellent.  As a game on it's own, sure it doesn't hold up, but it's still plenty of fun!

I loved the first Manhunt, but the quality and design of this one are 10 times lower than that of the first. The new weapons are cool, but every execution is fast and the camera is off in a strange angle so you can't really see what is going on.

The environments are disgustingly bland, dry, and boring. Almost each level is a box with a few crated and doors here and there. Where is the visual quality of the first game?! Each level uses the same objects used in every other level. There is no design to the levels, just a box of enemies to kill after another. Also, getting spotted usually results in game over. If you are knocked down by an enemy, you are stunned for about 5 seconds while they are beating on you. Even if you don't fall down, your character does a long drawn out stun animation giving the enemy a chance to hit you again, restarting the animation. If you get hit, you are essentially dead.

There is also WAY too big an emphasis on gunplay. In the first you had guns but they were never required. In this one, some levels each enemy has a gun and they are in a position where you HAVE to engage in a gun battle. Sneaking is not an option. This game I feel suffered the same fate of Resident Evil 6; They took a game from its roots and made it into more of a shooter and as a result, it disappointed big time.

The game is also short. I downloaded it yesterday and I sit here the next day writing this review. Once you beat the game it's over.

The Bad:
* The buzzing.  Unless I'm totally aligned with the transmitter, there is a constant buzzing in the left ear.  I removed all outside interference (unplugging everything and even cutting power to all but xbox and tv) without any luck. I tried the outside USB power source.  I also tried 5 Xboxes in 3 totally different locations (as in address, not same house).
* It says wireless, so I expected totally wireless.  There is a wire between the controller and the headset.  Not a big deal, but I went in thinking it had no wires (again, my first set of TB headphones).
* You need a seperate RCA output for your Xbox if you use HDMI. It would have been good to mention that somewhere other than the setup manual, or include the part with the headset.  They aren't very expensive, so not a big deal, but I just wish I didn't have to place a second order and wait 2 more days.
* Figuring out how to pair them was a real pain.  I wasn't holding the power button on the headset in long enough to make it beep twice.  That took me a while to figure out.

The Good:
* Great sound.  I was really happy with all the settings and the neat effect of where I can hear what direction sounds are coming from.
* The mic is really great.  I went from my friends constantly asking me to repeat myself to them complimenting me on how good I sound.  The ""hear yourself"" part is nice too and has no delay between speaking and it coming through.
* Comfortable for me to wear for an extended time.

I contacted Turtle Beach support about the buzzing and was told my first pair was deffective, but that of course turned out to be incorrect. I exchanged them, then second pair had the same problem.  I considered the X42s, but they have very similar ""buzzing"" reviews.  I was considering one of the more high-end sets from Turtle Beach as well, but I really don't want to risk having the buzzing sound on those and deal with this whole return/exchange process again.  I will be returning the second pair and just trying the X12s instead, since I was very happy with the sound/mic.

I'm really shaken in confidence about how well Turtle Beach products perform, at least wirelessly, now.  I know these aren't super high-end, but they could have at least did something to filter out this problem.  I still would really like a wireless set, but I'll definately be looking elsewhere when the time comes to purchase it.",Left Ear buzzing kills any good parts of this headset,1336348800,,,

I finally quit because of the following reasons, and no I was never a power player, never had a all powerful Jedi, and didn't quit because I lost my edge.

One major problem in the last year of gameplay was the broken promises made by the SWG team, they would show hints of great things coming in their fan events, and they would never come about, such as guild spaceships etc, what was shown at the fan event they said later was just something they were ""playing with"" and never meant as something going live, so the tease at the fan event was nothing more than a tool to keep players interested and playing.

Trying to get World of Warcraft players by copying WOW, and it's obvious since the NGE that devs, who the president admitted they all played WOW were there stealing ideas in some vain attempt to get WOW numbers, and as one article said at MMPOG.com  about SWG,""The release of WoW caused SOE/LucasArts to radically alter the originally planned ""rebalance"" to an ""upgrade"" that not only incorporated many of Blizzard's features, but also added a ton of bugs to boot. SWG was simply not compatible with a linear style WoW gameplay. Those who wanted WoW's features were already playing WoW, without the bugs."" if you play or played WOW you can see how much they are taking from that game and trying to incorporate it into SWG, which isn't compatible with the SWG game itself, causing major bugs and tech problems.

Lack of new content, while SWG devs are trying to incorporate WOW gameplay into SWG, they have basically dropped new content, they started after the NGE makine quests for lower levels and working their way up, so in fact if you are playing the game, you are paying while they rebuild the game from the ground up to make it more like WOW, in essense paying to beta test, I refused to do that.

Bugs and more Bugs, bugs that never was fixed from it's launch or still around, new bugs created as they tried to incorporat WOW gameplay into a game that wasn't made for it, and it seemed every patch they made to fix a bug, it would make 10 more bugs.

In some areas it succeeds, but in most it fails. This game had no affiliation with Sid Meier, creator of CivI and II (the latter arguably the best pc strategy game ever).
Pros:
Good government selection. Some new governments are included, like Fascism, Technocracy, Theocracy, Ecology, Corporate Republic, etc.
Armies and Fleets. In CivII a stack of units could be killed in what attack. This is not so.
Automated Improvements. The government automatically does terrain improvements.
Diplomacy and Trade: Both are well planned and fairly extensive.
Cons:
Diplomacy and Trade: Neither are used to their full extent, and if you try, other civilizations refuse. There's all types of stuff, like trade embargoes, etc, but the AI never does them.
Civilizations: Over 30 Civs to choose from, but there's really no difference in between them. Also, whenever I play, I'm always up against the same Civs: French, British, German, Irish, Scottish, American, and Native Americans. That gets boring very fast.
Slow: The interface is slow, even on a 128MB Ram P3 500mhz machine.
Scenarios: Only 4 of them, and none are any good.
NO CUSTOMIZATION OF UNITS OR CIVS: In Civ2 anyone could make their own units, terrains, technologies, scenarios, maps, etc. You can't do any of this in CTP2.
Conclusion: Civ3 should be out in the US within 2 months, it's coming to Mac, and to Europe. Civ3 has Sid Meier working on it. Civ3 has elaborate diplomacy and trade. Civ3 has culture points, great military leaders, many unit animations, civ specific units, new paths to victory, total customization of units, civs, techs, maps, etc, has better graphics, more realistic, more units, will ship with 12 scenarios, and so much more.

Problems:
1.  I was eager to play this game BUT first the game MUST be installed on the hard drive (10-gig of space required).  Once this 30-minute installation process has run its course, patches begin...tons and tons of time-consuming patch installations.  If players have slow or limited DSL service (like me), this process is a real painful, aggravating process.  Just to play the game required more than 2-1/2-hours.

The car models are swarmed with nasty looking jaggies that I've never seen before in previous car games on the PSX. The models look somewhat decent, but their outward appearance is very grainy, thanks to the jaggies. Not exactly very nice car detail, and I'm frankly disappointed. The environments are very shabby, they flicker like crazy and on top of that look downright pixilated. When you look at the floor, or the backgrounds you should notice how incredibly ugly everything looks, it makes me even wonder if Eutechnyx spent any time on the game from E3 2000 up until the release date. The frame rates are fine, but at times may act up, and don't get me started on the pop-up 'cause this game is right up there with Driver 2. The game's collision detection is also a pile (...), and the overall look of the visuals looks hardly alpha staged, the only good thing I can say about the visuals is that they move and there are colors, otherwise everything else, including special effects look like demo titles running on a first wave PSX tool-kit. But I must admit that the CGs are some of the best in any PS game yet.
  The concept of the game is quite good, only if it was better executed. You are James Bond of course, except you are Pierce Brosnan not Sean Connery or the other Bonds, that is bad impact number one. The game's plot is totally unrealistic, you will see Pierce Brosnan in every single vehicle, including a DB5 and tons of other classic Bond vehicles. I believe that it was a stupid move by the developer to only put Pierce Brosnan in 007 Racing, because true Bond fans will be completely turned off by the game. Losing some critical points there, 007 Racing also suffers from un-balanced and boring missions, such as picking up people, shooting down a helicopter with only one try, escorting this person, that person, blah, blah, blah. By the second mission you'll definitely notice what kind of horrendously boring product your playing. If you folks want to know, there are 15 missions to complete, all of which are explained to you in a mission briefing, but none that I would like to listen to. There are a few decent stages, take for example the Highway Hazzard, what you do here is you follow an 18-wheeler and your goal is to pop the wheels on the truck using a hi-tech device. In case you're wondering, the two-player missions need not to be played, you just won't have any fun with them at all. Some of the weapons that James Bond will use are missiles, homing missiles and machine guns, he will be able to use shields and replenish his lives by picking up health kits. Through the game you will be taken through tons of different areas such as New York, Louisiana, Eastern Europe, and Monte Carlo. 007 Racing is a lacking game with a great concept, if only the developer had taken time to balance out the missions, and perk up the visuals, we could have had a great game, but there is always the PS2 version which is currently under development.
  Audio is decent, but the songs are far too repetitive and can annoy the heck out of you. The voice acting on the other hand is quite good, but it seems as if Q would rather have the returned in one piece instead of having James back healthy. While playing the game you'll hear Q commenting on your performance, and may give you some hints at times. Most of the time the voice acting is found during the mission briefings by M and they can be quite long, but the clarity is good though so there isn't anything painful to be dealt with. Not bad audio effects, but if the soundtrack was worked on we could have had something much better.
  Controls are just too sloppy, every time I try to make a turn it feels like the emergency brake has been hit. The cars have absolutely no realistic feel to them at all, so car enthusiasts must look elsewhere. I'll give the game its nice analog features, both analog sticks work and they have a good deal of sensitivity. I honestly can't say much more about the controls, other than that they feel very sloppy, there is no realism to speak off and the only thing that's good about the controls are the analog sticks.
  Sadly what was once a very promising game, turned out to be a miserable failure, 007 could have been a good game if its visuals were worked on more, because I know that PSOne can do so much better than this, the gameplay needs to adjusting and the controls should have been tightened up for better gameplay. With horrible graphics, unsatisfactory and tedious gameplay, and loose controls 007 Racing is barely worth a purchase, let alone a rental, just stay away from this game if you know what's good for you and the Playstation.

Unfortunately, in my opinion, it's not quite ""there"" yet. I was able to notice a distinguishable latency that affected my game, making it much more enjoyable on my actual PS4 over my PS TV.

I tested it using the game Destiny. On ""high"" video quality mode, the default, it was nearly unplayable. It looked very nice, but the latency was harsh.

On ""normal"" mode, it was more playable, but it didn't look that nice, and there was enough latency to make it affect the game negatively.

I think the PS TV is a great idea, and hopefully over time, they will improve it to make it more seamless. In its current state right now, especially considering no Netflix, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.

The one aspect that people could find valuable is the option to play Vita games on the big screen. I haven't tested that, but it's not what I'd like to use it for.

The good:
* Graphics are fantastic! Love this simplified direction.
* Sounds are sim-style grunts - all around the sounds are very nicely done.
* Quick to get into.

The bad:
* Dumbed down game play leaves very little in the way of strategy. This feels very much like an arcade port.
* Very little customization - you can only choose the country/leader you want, map, land age, all those settings we are used to in Civ games are removed.
* Map size (singular) is incredibly small.
* Where as I remember taking over a week or two on a really nice Civ 3 game, I'd be amazed if anyone takes longer than a couple of hours on one of these.
* AI has two modes: wait, and destroy. There is no real negotiating besides giving your stuff to them on demand, or going to war on refusal.

My son recently purchased LBP3 for my PS3 and after a couple of days of playing he seemed to lose interest.  I decided to give it a go, and I immediately was underwhelmed and overwhelmed at the same time.

Similar to the second installment, you have other characters you can use that have special abilities that can reach areas that sackboy can't.  For example you have Toggle, who can change sizes on demand that allow him to fit in tight spots (little), and to activate weight sensitive switches (large).  There is also Swoop, which is basically a bird that can fly through areas that have no platform to stand on.  There is also a frog like character that can also wall jump.  In addition to the new characters, Sackboy has many abilities of his own depending on what he is wearing, (jump boots, and a helmet that allows him to attach to and glide along pipes).  In this regard, I was overwhelmed with the new characters, and new abilities.  The beauty of LBP1 was in its simplicity, but with LBP2, and definitely LBP3, they just seemed to want to do way too much never allowing the player to fully enjoy the core game.  In this regard I was overwhelmed with everything and it seemed every other level was basically just a training level to learn yet another ability and/or character.

In terms of being underwhelmed, for starters, the game is way too short.  Its possible to beat this in one sitting which didn't seem to be the case in LBP1.  Personally it took me a couple of days playing only occasionally.  I counted four maybe five distinct ""stages"", and that was it.  Of course there are challenges during these stages, but they add nothing to the overall story.  To add insult, 50% of the levels in these stages were basically training levels to teach you how to use a particular ability.

One major problem with this game is how buggy it was.  Quite often after I completed a stage, the game will be stuck on a loading screen, forcing me to quit the game using the PS button and start over again.  This happened way too often for my liking, and this even occurs when playing the user created levels.  Just recently I was playing a very good user created level, and then when I got to the end, the game was stuck on the loading screen.  For ""shiggles"", I decided to leave the game in this state to see just how long it would take for it to get past this point.  I left the PS3 on and decided to watch the NBA playoff games.  Seven hours later I switch back to the PS3 and the game is still ""Loading""; I haven't played the game since.  In addition to this, there are buggy levels that make a level harder than it really should be.  I recall one level where I had to use the jump boots to cross a wide chasm, but it was impossible to do because the jump point that I was supposed to cross simply did not work.  Only after looking on Youtube did I figure out the work around.  This is unacceptable, I really thought games were play tested before released, but apparently I am just being naive.  I certainly can understand a minor bug here and there, but blatant bugs like I've encountered should have never made it out of the testing phase.

Difficulty wise, I believe it may be too difficult for its main target audience (young children).  Even someone like myself that has been gaming for 30+ years encountered a little trouble on the later levels (especially the Swoop levels), but after practice and figuring out the timing I was able to complete the game with out further issue.  However, if veterans have trouble with this supposed children's game, I can only imagine how frustrating it must be for young kids who are still developing their coordination.  Games like this are supposed to be fun and provide some challenge, but instead for many younger gamers, it may just be just utter frustration.

All in all its an okay game, but misses the glory of the original by miles.  They try to do way too much and the many bugs and freezes only add to my disappointment.  The game itself I would give three stars to, but because of the bugs I bumped it down to two.

Playing as Kyle, brother to original FF character Cody, you are on a mission to find your missing brother and you'll take on plenty of enemies as you storm Metro City.  The first thing that kills Final Fight: Streetwise is that the beat 'em up genre has become such a trite and generic genre of gaming that even the originator of the genre can't introduce anything fresh to seperate it from hte long list of trite pretenders.

2.0,False,"08 31, 2012",A2XPH05TD0MNFL,B007CSF3GO,Z. Brictson,"When a video game character takes an arrow through the heart, context matters. In a battle, you could simply toss them a potion to regain their lost health, or maybe conjure a healing spell. But cutscenes are a whole different deal, entirely. A story is being told more directly now, so death is a finality. No phoenix downs here, sorry.

And a few cutscenes into The Last Story, you will witness a party member take that arrow through the heart. It's a dramatic sequence, where the game's hero, Zael, is seen kneeling over his comrade's body, unable to accept her passing. ""I'm sick of all the pain!"" he cries.

It's at this moment that a blinding light reveal itself to him, and grants him a power to better protect the ones he loves most. It is, of course, a new battle mechanism for the rest of the game, but another tutorial pops up alongside it. It's a tutorial on how to raise fallen allies -- *in battle*.

Control reverts back to the player, you step near the corpse of your beloved friend, and she rises. Her A.I. then runs right back into the fray. There is no ""thank you"", no shock, no acknowledgement that she was ever dying or that Zael just performed a miracle. The game never addresses what just happened, and just like that, Sakaguchi tears down the very narrative wall he is revered for.

Is this nitpicking? In the grand scheme of the 20 hour experience, it probably is. Perhaps you can forget this anomaly, even though every time else when Zael stands over a slain friend, you'll have a hard time not recognizing the stupidity of it all. The more important point, instead, is that a slip up this obvious is likely a sign of equally poor decisions to come.

Ready to unwind after their run in with death, Zael and his mercenary band of buddies hit up the bar in the castle town of Lazulis, preparing to take on a mission from the Count himself. It's their chance to finally make it big. And their chance to make sure they are understood as single faceted archetypes.

Swept under the rug about as fast as they are introduced there at the tavern, they don't have an opportunity to become much else. Take Yurick, for example, the guy with the eye patch who serves as your black mage. He stands in the corner, arms folded, and you could already guess but he says it for you anyways, ""my services don't extend to socializing."" How subtle.

Strangers, passing facades of personality, the whole lot of 'em. That's all they seem to serve as, and it eats away at this game. Having ownership over these ""friends"" of Zael, scrolling through their equipment menus and ordering them in combat -- it's a removed and empty feeling. Who are these people? The game rarely addresses that question, and it when it does, it's only to further its checklist of clich JRPG exposition.  A side adventure where Yurick learns the value of friendship? Check.

Even being concerned about their presence in battle isn't required until nearing the half way point, where some bosses force it upon you. You'll have to tell the nature girl, Mirania, to throw down a heal circle to step in so you can smack a dragon without worrying about losing one of your 5 lives. Seriously, you can die and get up 5 times each battle. Death and resurrection are treated as a kind of banality in The Last Story, apparently.

So go nuts, have fun, because the game is a carnival of clustered spell effects, large enemies, and small hallways, all coming at you at a framerate consistently below 20.  It's like smacking balloons.  Your strikes knock each enemy back far enough that you need to run a few steps forward to hit them again. Maybe walk around them if they have weak back sides, and hack away with your maxed out weaponry thanks to the surplus amount gold thrown at you.

There's strategy hidden here, using Zael's newly acquired miracle magic to lure the reptilian grunts out of the quagmire and into colorful circles placed by your mages. Getting them into a circle or surrounding them with your A.I. controlled buddies will speed up the rate of damage, but for much of the game, these occurrences are more convenient than necessary.

Understanding the motives behind these battles and not just their surface level silliness corrodes the mild sense of enjoyment the melee has. Just reach in the hat and pick any of the game's encounters. Like the scene where Zael is ambushed by ninja knights in the castle courtyard, and Uematsu's rocking bass line kicks in with desperation. You do your smacking, and afterwards Zael furiously questions a wounded ninja, ""Who sent you!?"" ""Think I'll talk?"" The ninja cackles back, and vanishes in smoke.

If only Zael wasn't such an oblivious man. Because the ninja henchman are none other than Duke Jillard's doing, the *only* man in the castle who had already tried to behead you twice before. But no, that would never cross Zael's mind. He's a blank slate of heroism, perfectly naive. Disgusted by violence, completely unaware of greed and corruption, there is not a moment in the game where he is an actual person. The game says he grew up on the streets as an orphan and mercenary, but he shows no sign of growth from this alleged stage.

And this Duke Jillard fellow, he serves as Zael's primary rival. His reasoning for being driven to madness in his efforts to murder you is this: One day he catches the young hero chatting to his bride to be, and Zael tells him that he should treat her better. That's it. Even when Zael is on a quest to save the entire world, Jillard is hell bent on achieving vengeance for this heinous offense.

That The Last Story is still a complete and functional little RPG cannot be denied. It comes with a town and fetch quests. It has villains who muse over world domination, who laugh manically behind closed doors. It has heroes, romance, betrayal, even upgradeable weapons. It's a game that plays by the book. And with that comfort zone to fall back on, The Last Story feels brave enough to pioneer the realm of cover systems, stealth, and third persons shooting.

Occasionally, you'll have to snipe some archers on a balcony, and being good sports, they'll tumble over the railing when you shoot them. And to sneak up on an ogre, you may think that, at the very least, this game requires a level of cover system based caution. But no, not even. The field of vision for enemies is so short that you can stand at the entrance of a hallway and shoot that ogre in the face, and he will come walking over to investigate. The game design is utterly skeletal.

And its lack of intelligence is evident at every turn, literally. Such as when the game throws you into a first person perspective when entering rooms so you can manually locate an item of interest. A big door or a book on a desk, the cursor will even point to where you need to look if you can't handle the pressure. And the sound effect, the little *kachlink*, like you should feel accomplished by spotting the clue. Like this is some type of educational software.

But there's Sakuguchi's name, stamped right on the front of it, and the world be damned if that's not a name that deserves some recognition. That's it's not a name that deserves to be taken seriously. And wouldn't it be lovely to find The Last Story was tongue in cheek through its entirety, or somehow satirically charming with brilliant undertones beneath its child like features? That somehow, all of this could be explained? Yet, it isn't so. The name's meaning is dead to this game, the cutscene kind of dead.

My biggest negative (and there are a lot of them) is that isn't intuitive. You get thrown into fights after long movie sequences, die, then have to go through the same sequence again. This happens frequently that there are no game-save opportunities and you have limited time to do the exact proper sequence to win a battle. Typically you have to do a major quest before moving on and there are limited minor quests to get points to level up. Several occasions I had to go into easy mode to get past a specific quest otherwise your stuck there running around not gaining any ground. I hate having to do that.

The maps are terrible and have no real use, the quest pointer isn't well thought out and pretty much useless too.

While the game certainly lives up to capturing the look and feel of the movie with the enviroments, gun sounds and music, it still plays like an ordinary FPS.

Graphics: I'm not one to complain much about graphics since I consider them of only second or third rate importance compared to gameplay, but oh man! The graphics in this game are so dated they're almost embarassing to look at. Textures will constantly pop in and out and even when they are all the way in they don't look very detailed. A while ago I was having fun with Doom 3: BFG edition; I'm not sure if it's because that game is still fresh in my memory but I can't help but think this game's graphics look very much the same....worse, actually. Very poor, laughable graphics all around.

Gameplay: Feels a little too much like CoD for my taste. The game comes with the now obligatory XP level up system for unlocking stuff in multi-player (which might be this games only saving grace). It really makes me feel less a part of the Aliens experience when a bar on the top tells me when I've ranked up. There's nothing innovative in the way the game controls, its mostly been ripped from other FPSers. Worst of all, I feel somewhat overpowered when fighting off Xenomorphs and human mercanaries. Yeah, I've died plenty of times but I'm suprised to see how high my kill count is at the end of a level, usually in the sixties. Xenomorphs will run mindlessly around every which way when you're fighting them and occasionally you'll even see a computer controlled fellow marine and an alien run into and clip right through each other. Your comrades aren't very smart either and will sometimes get hung up on a wall or run in the wrong direction. Your comrades also seem to be invincilbe. Not once did I ever worry about them or feel I needed to help, unless the game told me to. The only remotely cool thing is wrestling off a xenomorph when it grabs me and shooting it with my pistol...but even that feels a little silly. Aren't these thing supposed to be strong enough to bust through a steel door?

Level design is a least pretty good. The game has many branching corridors that you can sometimes get lost in. Kind of annoying but It would be even more annoying if the game constantly had arrows pointing your way and thus taking out all thought process. One level of particular note is one in which you're unarmed, helpless, and have to sneak your way through a level of blind, motion traking aliens withouth them noticing. This level had me genuinely scared, but I regret that some of the scare factor was taken away when I saw that these aliens kill you by suicide bombing. Obvious Left 4 Dead elements shamelessly ripped. This bit of survival horror is a nice touch but only a small bit of novelty in an unremarkable game.

Story: Not much story. You're a Marine sent along with several other Marines to investigate the remains of the Sulaco and later LV-426. Throughout, you'll have to fight off waves of xenomorphs and human mercanaries dispatched by the evil Wayland Yutoni Corp. who are, as ever, hell bent on capturing the xenomorphs to use as biological weapons. This is the plot of all the Alien movies thus far and its getting more than a little old.

2.0,True,"09 25, 2015",A1S5QVS3YLY6FK,B00JUFSH6U,TW,"Awhile back, I decided to convert from a console gamer to a PC gamer. I had a few exceptions. Sports games aren't released on the PC as often as the console, so I kept my Xbox 360 just for sports games. I wasn't impressed with what I saw of Madden 16, so I instead bought Madden 15. My last Madden was Madden 13.

My main gripe with football games is the difficulty or lack of. From the earliest days of sports licensed games (late 80s - early 90s), I've rarely found a sports game that is challenging, unless you set the difficulty very high. Then as most know, it becomes a game of frustration and patience as you watch computer AI opponents become with 12 foot jumping interceptions, being blocked by two players only to squeeze between them and get a sack ... two, three times a game. Madden was never my favorite as I preferred the NCAA football game. With no new NCAA games, Madden 15 would have to be my football gaming fix this year.

Sadly, any thought of a challenge disappeared during my first exhibition game. I'll never understand the ""realism"" other people find in these football games. In my first exhibition game, I used the Chicago Bears against the Detroit Lions. I didn't touch any of the sliders or settings (penalties, stamina, quarter length). It's my belief that the default settings and sliders should give the most realistic result. Sliders, to me, were there for when you had played 3-4 seasons and had gotten too good at the game to have realistic results. Settings, especially quarter length, was for stat lovers who wanted a little extra time to pick up their players stats. My first game result with default sliders and settings:
Chicago Bears 45 - Detroit Lions 10
Notable players stats:
Jay Cutler 14-16 passing, 286 yards, 2 TDs, 0 INTs
Matt Stafford 6-22 passing, 57 yards, 1 TD, 3 INTs
Matt Forte 13 rushes, 178 yards, 2 TDs
Jacquizz Rodgers 6 rushes, 84 yards, 2 TDs
Joique Bell 15 rushes, 12 yards
Bears defense 11 sacks, 6 turnovers (3 INTs, 3 fumbles recovered)
Total yards:
Bears 568
Lions 115
I don't think I need to explain how unrealistic these stats are. The worst part for me is the quarter length setting. If you look at the Bears QB and RB combined with the Lions QB and RB, there was only 38 passes between the two teams and 28 rushes between the two teams top RBs. To put some perspective on that, when these two teams played last year with the near exact rosters as I'm using in this game, those two QBs combined for 93 passes attempted and the two teams combined for 31 rushing attempts. That means in the real game the two teams ran right at double the plays as the same two teams ran on Madden 15. I'll agree that video game football is supposed to be a little more geared towards big, exciting plays than long drawn out drives, but to get the stats to match or even be close between Madden and real-life results, one would need to play 12 minute quarters. Just prorating the stats I had in the 6 minute quarters, that would have made the score Bears 90 Lions 20. Cutler would have had nearly 600 yards passing, Forte would have been over 300 yards. The teams would have nearly 1,500 total yards combined.

I adjusted the sliders making the game ""harder"". The only big difference I saw was the number of interceptions I was throwing. I was still rushing at will with any team and with any running back. Outside of turning the difficulty up to Madden level and adjusting all sliders to make the computer AI defense as good as possible, I was still carrying the ball at a 10+ yards average per rush. It's pretty sad when you have to spend the second half of the game making negative rushes just to lower your RBs yards per carry to a believable level. The pass defense AI isn't much better. I even tried making the game feel a little more challenging by intentionally throwing the ball out of bounds for an incomplete pass for my QBs stats and so my offense would have only two plays to get a first down.

It's frustrating when you have to play a game the opposite of how it should be played just so you won't feel like you're just wasting your time. If all this is a little confusing or hard to understand, I decided to play a full season with 8 minute quarters, All-Pro difficulty, all sliders adjusted to favor the computer AI opponent. This was the result:

Bears 16-0 in regular season. Won the Super Bowl.
Jay Cutler 6,008 yards - Broke all-time single season record by 600 yards.
Cutler 58 TDs passing, 7 INTs - Broke all-time single season passing TDs record.
Forte 2,673 yards rushing - Broke all-time single season rushing yards record by 500 yards.
Forte 31 rushing TDs - Broke all-time single season rushing TD record.
Jeffrey 2,217 receiving yards - Broke all-time single season receiving yards record.
To make all this even worse, the Bears also had these stats:
Rodgers the second string RB had 1,426 yards with 14 TDs, the yards ranked 3rd in the NFL and the rushing TDs also ranked 3rd.
Bennett the Bears Tight End had 1,729 yards
Royal the Bears #2 WR had 1,256 yards

As a lifelong Bears fan I can tell you those stats aren't even close to being accurate. It's more believable for me to say those are the least accurate stats possible. Needless to say, I put the game back in its case and it's not likely that I'll play it again. I would like to think it's just my general football knowledge that allows me to post these type of stats, but I do the same on all of EA's sports games including FIFA, and I've never even played soccer nor do I even understand the majority of soccer's penalties.

It's a punishment for not being pro enough. And you're pretty much screwed unless you have to mood and time to go back and start off again. There are other flaws as well.

(This is a review that I originally wrote on 12/20/2004)
--------------------------------------------------

The first Backyard Wrestling game (subtitled ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-t-Try-This-At-Home/dp/B00009YEJV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don't Try This At Home</a>"") received poor reviews from just about everyone who played it, so you'd expect for Eidos to learn and make a better sequel. Of course, you'd be wrong. Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes The Neighborhood (BYW2) is pretty much the same as BYW1, for good and for bad.

The Basics

The game includes 25 playable wrestlers (all unlocked from the start) and 5 CAW slots. Of the 25, only 4 are female: Adrienne Pain, Sunrise Adams (adult film actress), Tera Patrick (adult film actress), and Tylene Buck. The other 21 are male: Andrew WK, El Drunko, Kelvin Finn, Luke Hadley, Madman Pondo, Masked Horn Dog, Messiah, New Jack, Ruckus, Rude Boy, Ryuji Ito, Sandman, Shaggy 2 Dope, Sick Nick Mondo, Sonjay Dutt, Supreme, Vampiro, Vic Grimes, Violent J, and Zandig.

A big problem with the game is that there's very little to do in it. Up to two players can duke it out in a 1-on-1 exhibition match, or a single player can go through the Career mode (you can have up to 10 saved careers). That's it. There's nothing else to do. One of the reasons WWE games are ranked so highly is because they give you a wide variety of match types. This game is just one match type: 1-on-1 hardcore. Although the game tries to give you the impression of variety, the entire game consists of you playing this same exact match over and over and over again. There's no reason a BYW game has to stick to non-ring-based action. Heck, watch the BYW Videos in the game's Media Room and you'll see that 95% of the action in the real-live events takes place in a ring. There should be the following match types: tag team, handicap (not the fight one guy then the other ""handicap"" match that this game has as it's career finale), lumberjack, steel cage, Hell in the Cell (though they'd have to use a different name since WWE probably has that copyrighted), plus the non-ring hardcore action. In short, everything you see in a WWE game should be here, but with the violence and blood turned up to the EXTREME! The rings should have regular, barb wire, and electrified ropes (player's choice). There should be thumb tacks, barb wire bats, panes of glass (they should be held and set up like tables in a WWE game), and other assorted ""ultra-violent"" weapons. Tables should not be part of the environment (they're ""Enviro-Mental Throws/Attacks"" in this game). They should be items you can pick up, place somewhere, stackable, and do moves onto - like you see in the WWE SmackDown! games.

Loading times throughout the game are 15-20 seconds each, but they happen right before every single opponent, plus short ones before going back to the menus. I shutter to think of how many minutes total of loadings you will sit through by the time you're done with Career mode.

Create-A-Wrestler (CAW) sucks, which is sad because you're forced to use it for career mode the first time you play it. There are so few options that I can practically list all of them here. There are only 6 body types: 4 male (athletic, muscular, overweight, slim), 2 female (athletic, muscular) with 16 different skin tones (most of which are useless unless you want funky colored wrestlers). There are 6 different face styles for each gender. There are 7 different hair styles for each gender with 16 different hair colors (again, most are rather funky). In terms of clothing, each gender has 18 upper body (shirts), 18 lower body (pants), and 6 footwear (including bare feet) choices. You can choose two different colors for each, assuming the piece of clothing has a base and a stripe.

Rounding out the CAW options are a few custom logos/tattoos, a limited selection of moves, and 35 mostly useless CAW accessories that you can buy for $200 each in the shop section of Career mode. How useless are they, you may be wondering? Take a look at this list and judge for yourself: Top Hat, Cowboy Hat, Football Helmet, Do Rag, Skater Helmet, Headband, Bowler, Visor, Sun Hat, Beanie, Beret, Headphones, Hard Hat, Baseball Cap, Ear Muffs, Biker's Helmet, Sunset Shades, Round Glasses, 3-D Glasses, Eye Patch, Painter's Mask, Clown Nose, Corn Cob Pipe, Bandage, Big Ears, Tiny Shades, Left Arm Band, Double Elbow Pads, Double Wrist Bands, Gauntlets, Biker Gloves, Bandoleer, Messenger Bag, Backpack, Bow Tie, Single Gun Belt, Double Knee Pads, Shin Guards, Wallet Chain, Tool Belt, Knee Brace, Spurs, Leg Garter, Studded Belt, and Snow Shoes. Nothing says ""I'm a hardcore brawler, don't F with me"" more than a guy wearing a Bowler hat, 3-D glasses, a clown nose, and a pair of snow shoes. To the game's credit, though, a few of these looked great on a gal wearing the default thong outfit (cowboy hat, biker gloves, and leg garter).

On top of that, you can't even delete CAWs. The best you can do is revert them back to their default appearance and moves, but the CAW slot will still be filled - even after you've deleted your Career save and the CAW no longer has a use. Also, you can't import CAWs from another game save/memory card.

Besides the CAW accessories, the game has a few other unlockables, but they're really not worth the effort to unlock. If you can manage to make it through the game tedious and boring Career mode, you get the option to play it all over again, but this time with one of the in-game wrestlers. Since the story is exactly the same as the first time, there's nothing new to see by playing it again with an established character instead of the CAW you used the first time. As an added bonus, completing Career mode also unlocks all of the ""Game Videos"" in the Media Room. These are the same video you've seen throughout season mode (actually, each one is unlocked after you view it in the course of your career).

These videos are only marginally better than the ones you can buy from $1000 each in the shop. The five purchasable videos are short highlight reels of these wrestlers: Zandig, Ryuji Ito, Sick Nick Mondo, Vic Grimes, and Sandman. Before you get too excited, you should know that they each run a mere 35-40 seconds and contain no audio at all. In fact, almost all of the ""BYW Videos"" in the Media Room are 35-40 second audioless highlight reels. These are the same clips shown on the main menu. However, there are more clips shown on the main menu than there are in the Media Room. All of the main menu videos should be viewable in the Media Room, where they're displayed full screen. I, personally, would have rather watched the clips of the ladies (Tylene Buck, Tera Patrick, and Sunrise Adams) in the Media Room than a clip of Andrew WK singing, made pointless by the fact that there's no audio in it.

The only ""BYW Videos"" that have audio are three relatively short music videos and the promo/newspiece (""Pulse""). I have never seen a wrestling match from BYW or any of the other feds represented in the game. It would have been more beneficial for them to include one or two whole matches, instead of all these pointless, short, and mostly audioless video clips. Maybe *that* would get me interested in buying one of their videos.

The ""Pulse"" video is a TechTV story about the game and a wrestling event held to promote it several months (?) before its release. One of the game designers proudly mentions that BYW2 was the first wrestling game with confirmed online capabilities. There is no online mode in the final product. Oops!

The design of the different fighting areas is pretty good overall, though of course, some are better than others. I, personally, like the Office because you can break ALL of the cubicles in the middle of the room, and when that's done, you're left with a TON of weapons and one open area to fight in.

Gameplay

The game engine is essentially the same as in BYW1, but with a few additions, such as submission holds and a block button. There's also a new type of environmental attack, appropriately titled an ""Enviro-Mental"" attack. You can perform these attacks when you have your opponent in a front grapple and you're positioned in the right spots of each fighting area. You'll know when you're in the right spot because an exclamation point inside a triangle will appear on the screen. All you have to do is press the Triangle button and a cutscene will pop up showing you doing an extreme move to your opponent, like powerbombing him through a picnic table, hitting him with beer bottles, or frying his face on a fast food grill.

The problem with the environmental attacks, as with ALL attacks, is that the wrestlers don't sell their moves. They'll pop right back up on their feet as if you just blew air in their face. In WCW Kevin Nash once sold a finger poke to the chest as if he had just gotten hit with a bowling ball, yet here they act like nothing happened if you repeatedly slam their head in the truck of a car. The only time wrestlers act like a move really hurt them, is when they MISS a move that THEY were trying to perform.

One of my biggest grievances about the game engine is that reversals require guesswork, not skill. When in a grapple, you have to guess which of the four face buttons your opponent will use for his next move, and press it before he does his move. This is just like the reversal system introduced in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Smackdown-Shut-Your-Mouth/dp/B00006IJJF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Smackdown Shut Your Mouth</a>&nbsp;in 2002 (in that game it was the four d-pad directions instead of the face buttons). A lot of people apparently hated this system (such as me), and it was changed to a much simpler 2-button method (one for strikes, one for grapples) for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-next-WWE-game-in-2003/dp/B0000AHOOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the next WWE game in 2003</a>. Why BYW2 would use a reversal system that wasn't even kept for the WWE games is beyond me. (I don't remember if BYW1 used this reversal system or not.)

Career Mode

The meat and potatoes of the single player experience is the Career mode, which replaces the short Talk Show mode from BYW1. The Talk Show mode was boring and repetitive, and guess what? Some things never change.

The story is simple enough: The Backyard Wrestling ""federation"" has come to your town with a $1 million prize to anyone who can plow through the competition and win all the regional championships.

Career mode consists of ten fighting areas. The first nine are grouped into three sets (or tiers), with the last area being the locale of the finale. Each of the first nine areas contains five ""missions"" and five ""challenges"" each, with the last in each tier also containing a Title Tournament. The finale area contains the final five challenges. Thus bringing it to a grand total of 45 missions and 50 challenges, plus 3 title tournaments.

Not everything is unlocked from the start. You need to complete one tier in order to unlock the next, and the tenth and final area is unlocked after the third tier. The game has a rather confusing way of setting this all up, so I'm going to try to explain this as simple as possible. Please try to follow along. I'll use Tier 1 as an example (it contains the Backyard, Trailer Park, and Pool areas). You can play all 15 missions (five per area, remember) in any order you want. However, you must complete all 15 in order to unlock 12 of the 15 challenges (again, five per area) and the Title Tournament in the Pool area (the last area in each tier has the tournament). Completing the tournament (four matches total) not only unlocks the next tier (set of three areas), but also unlocks the three Title Defense challenges in the Backyard, Trailer Park, and Pool areas (one defense per area). If you lose any of the three Title Defense challenge matches, you have to play that tier's tournament all over again to reclaim the belt. This whole procedure of completing all 15 missions and the title tournament is required for all three tiers. It's quite possible that you don't even need to do the Challenges, but I did them anyway, so I can't tell you for certain.

If this all sounds like it makes perfect sense, it's because I explained it to you and you didn't have to figure it out for yourself using the rather disorganized menu in the game. The game doesn't even do anything to signify that you did all the missions and challenges in an area. You'd think they'd put a big X over the locale on the useless ""why is it taking up space on the screen"" map. Anyway, if you think this doesn't sound so bad, wait until I tell you specifically about the missions and challenges.

MISSIONS

You are given a specific objective for a match or a series of matches. Some of these include: performing a specific number of reversals, using a Weed Whacker three times, or just avoiding your opponents attacks 20 times. For objectives like these, you don't even have to go on to win the match. Once you perform the objective required, you can just quit the match and go on to the next objective. Later in the game, some objectives will require you to win a match within a set period of time, win a match with more or less than a certain percentage of health, or just to fight without using certain moves. Obviously, in these cases, you actually DO need to finish the match.

Some of the missions are downright stupid. No one in the right mind would do what they want you to do in a normal match on purpose. I mean, who really would want to finish a match with less than 10% percent health, if they didn't have to? Since I hate the reversal system (as I've previously mentioned) you can imagine how thrilled I was when I had to reverse 20 moves as one of the mission objectives.

These ""Missions"" should be in a separate ""Challenge"" section outside of career ala WWE SmackDown! Vs. Raw, with unlockables earned for completing them. They should NEVER have been made a required part of completing career mode.

What makes the missions even harder is that the game doesn't specifically tell you how to complete them. I rented this game, so I had no manual to give me the controls. I had to rely on the information given on the loading screens. While this is good most of the time (and I made sure to write down the controls as fast as I could - though the few screens repeat often enough that you'll get all the info down soon enough), the game has a nasty habit of giving you loading screens that don't relate to the objectives for the match you're about to play, or giving you the information you need AFTER you need it. For example, I played a mission in which I was not allowed to grapple, so guess what information was on the loading screen before the match? Yup, the grapple controls. Better yet, there's a mission in which I had to perform a Guard Break (I believe that's what it was). The game decided not to tell me how to perform the move until *AFTER* I quit the match out of frustration (it was on the loading screen that takes you back to the menu).

CHALLENGES

The five goals almost always are as follows:

* Fight a real wrestler. Sometimes you'll be required to finish him off specifically with a knockout, pin, or submission. On two instances, you will be forced to ""hunt"" for a specific wrestler: The game will give you several matches with random jobbers, occassionally giving you the wrestler you NEED to fight, and if you beat him three times, you complete the challenge.

* Fight a jobber (a freaky-looking CAW), who will then by replaced with a real wrestler.

* Win three matches in a row.

* Win five matches in a row.

* Defend your title (unlocked only after you win the tournament).

From what I can tell, the challenges are optional, as it doesn't seem like you need to do them to progress in the career (I did them anyway, so I can't say for sure).

The challenges are what should have been required for career mode, as they make more sense within the context of the story.

At this point you should have realized that the ""Missions"" should have been called ""Challenges"" and vice versa.

Graphics

The graphics are decent, but nothing more than what's required to get the job done. I've read that they're better than what was in BYW1, but without doing a side-by-side comparison, they don't look that much better to me.

A nice touch is that a wrestler who is repeated pummeled will have blood stains all over his body by the end of the match. Sadly, the blood stains look like someone drew lines on them with red marker. There's no dripping blood, hence why I call them stains.

Sound

Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-SmackDown-Vs-Raw/dp/B0002RQ3KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE SmackDown! Vs. Raw</a>&nbsp;(SVR), the game features wrestler voice-overs (used in intro/outro cutscenes and a few Career videos only). For the most part, they are done by the real people, though the following use substitutes: Sandman, Vampiro, Kelvin Finn, Ruckus, and Adrienne Pain (I'm not sure if those last three are real people or characters made specifically for the game). Also just like SVR, the voice acting is really bad.

A big problem is that the sounds of impacts, punches, weapons, and the such, all sound very flat and underwhelming. There are also times when a sound effect should be heard, but isn't. This completed undermines any power that a move should have.

Some of the artists on the licensed soundtrack include: Insane Clown Posse, Andrew WK, Kool Keith, Bad Brains, Body Count, and Hoobastank. So if you're into that type of music, you're sure to love the very large soundtrack (there was over two and a half minutes of music listings in the end credits!). I, personally, didn't like the music in the game, so I turned it off. That's not to say the game didn't turn it back on itself every now and then. Speaking of glitches ...

Glitches

I've encountered many of them while playing the game. Some of them are pretty bad and could actually make you lose matches or missions/challenges. Here's a small list.

* Because I don't like the in-game music, I turned it off (by setting the volume to zero). Every now and then, while in Career mode, after a match, as it autosaves my game before going back to the menu, the music would come back on. It stays on while I'm on the menu, only going back off when the match loading screen appears.

* One time in the pool area, and MANY times in the restaurant area, I found my character inexplicably walking by herself towards the bottom of the screen. She would not move in the direction I wanted her to, and would only stop her migration to screen bottom if I held the block button or got into a move with my opponent.

* If doing a move on a ledge (like in the pool area), you may end up doing the move without even touching the opponent. Sometimes both characters will even shake violently like they're having a seizure or something.

* Wrestlers will sometimes fall out of grapples and teleport to standing positions in another part of the fighting area.

* The enemy artificial intelligence is also quite bad, and I don't think it's because I had the AI Difficulty set to Low. Almost every time a match started in the junkyard area, my opponent would run straight to the red van on the right and just keep running into it for a few seconds.

I also came across a glitch that prevented me from getting 100% completion in Career mode. Office: Challenge: Title Defense never becomes selectable (it's always greyed out). I had no problem playing the other eight Title Defense challenges. I completed career mode with 45 out of 45 missions completed and 49 out of 50 challenges completed.

I didn't even get all ""opponents seen."" I would think that the game would have shown me all of them by the end of career.

Play Time/Replayability

If you use cheat device codes (like Infinite Health & Turbo for Player 1, No Turbo for Player 2), you can probably work through career mode in six to ten hours - if you don't get bored first. If you play it straight, then it'll take a lot longer due to all of the stupid tasks the game forces you to complete. That's if you don't become bored AND overly-frustrated and just give up on the game altogether.

Replayability is practically non-existent for a single player because if you do complete career mode, you will NOT want to play it again with the newly unlocked option to use an in-game wrestler this time. And even if you did, it would be the exact same season you played through the first time.

Of course, two players will get a little more replayability out of the game, but not much more, because there's only so many times you can play a 1-on-1 match against each other before you both get bored. It's not like there's a plethora of areas to fight in, anyway. If you do one match in each area, after 10 matches, you will have seen them all.

--- Original Review ---

I've used just about every controller made: Ideazon Fang, SteelSeries Merc Stealth & Z-Board, Belkin Nostromo n50, n52te, Logitech G13 and the Razer Nostromo.  This is the best so far, with full mechanical switches and eight-way programmable thumbpad.

I primarily use the controller for MMO games like World of Warcraft, so this review is focused on that kind of gaming experience.  Overall, it is a good controller for gaming.  I've been using a keyboard for so long since my last controller that I'm finding I don't use it as much as I thought I would, but that's just me.

Pros: Build quality is outstanding.  Not quite as solid as the Logitech G13, but close.  I have read other reviews about the adhesive hold the palm pad failing, but this has not been an issue for me.  The mechanical keys feel great and provide excellent tactile feedback.  The programming interface is not the greatest, but easy enough to master (get online documentation from the Razer website).  If you're into the Razer ""Chroma"" bling lighting, this product also synchronizes perfectly with the other Razer Chroma products.

Cons: (My personal opinions, your mileage may vary).  The keys are spaced too far apart for all but the largest hands.  The thumb lever is too easy to trigger by mistake.  The advertised WoW addon is out of date and appears ""worthless"" according to most reviewers on Curse.  I looked at it for about a minute, said ""Meh,"" and uninstalled it.

In summary, it's not perfect.  However: As the Fang is no longer available, this is the best suited MMORPG left-hand controller on the market at this time (in my opinion, of course).",Not recommended after a month of use.,1464739200,,{'Style:': ' Mechanical'},

Like many it's also much more simple and dumbed down with more handholding and little character customization. If you like the instanced approach of GW then GW2 is not for you. If you liked the unique arena PVP of GW than GW2 is not for you, if you liked the control of GW than GW2 is not for you, if you liked the multiple class customizations, enthralling story, or anything about the original than you should probably stick with it instead. The only thing it seems to carry over is the lore but being based far in the future there is little more than throwback references and the story is so poorly executed it's sad. I was stupefied when I heard about the large scale PVP battles they were proposing and that the players homeland in the original game was now occupied by another playable race and then found out that there was absolutely no PVP or PVE story involving fighting for it, in fact you have no choice but to support the occupying race...I can't believe they missed a prime opportunity to actually make a decent story element again.
As for the actual game play to be fair they did try some innovative elements such as the jump in any time event system but there's not enough for me to forgive paying an upfront cost on what is otherwise on the level of a generic free to play MMO supported by microtransactions which they have shown multiple times already since launch to prioritize over game breaking bugs when it comes to patching, there are many of those that they put their final product out this unpolished should be an embarrassment. Their support is one thing that has not changed they are still as arrogant and willing to turn the game on it's head through updates because they don't like the way the community was shaping it and this poor bug support just makes it worse.
It's not a terrible unplayable game but one with many frustrations either over bugs or what the game could of been, I'll play it long enough to get my moneys worth out of it but for no reason other than that there are other games I could of spend the money on instead.

It always seems like the controls takes half a second to respond, and when you're trying to make slight adjustments when looking down a gun sight, it always moves too much.

Crouching is also terrible.  You must always hold down the crouch button if you want to crouch;  You can't ""toggle"" it.  To make matters worse, you must hold up to peek out of cover, and then you have to activate your sights if you want to use them.  You must do this while holding the crouch button the entire time.

The real stinker though is the fact that you can only carry ONE weapon besides the terrible pistol which is your mandatory secondary firearm.

Using a Missile launcher is terrible, because once you fire those three rockets, you have no weapon other than the useless pistol.

The demo for this seemed good and I wasn't averse to a simulation style game so I got it.  The graphics are very sharp, the sound is great with lots of ways to customize (I like the ability to adjust the goal horn volume so it sounds like the end of the world when the home team scores).  The commentary even analyzes your gameplay and what is or isn't working.  You can even customize the music with your own tracks.  There are many major improvements like this over the versions of yesteryear.  I got this after the patch came out and have not experienced any issues with bugs.

The only thing that destroys the experience is the absolutely broken controls.  I have great patience for learning new and unique control schemes, like UFC Undisputed, Ninja Gaiden and even the dreaded Fight Night analog stick punching.  But there's a difference between awkward and unresponsive.  I get dominated in faceoffs by the CPU no matter how I adjust that option.  Slap shots fail most of the time.  You're supposed to pull back on the right stick, then push it forward to shoot.  What happens is my player lowers his stick, then takes a very weak wrist shot.  Even in practice mode it doesn't work consistently.  Checks are also dicey at best.  I've defended a guy camped near my goal, perfectly timed a poke check to cut off a pass, only to have him receive it anyway and score as if I wasn't even there.  Forget about scoring in this game.  Unless you have the goalie beat with a wide open net, virtually nothing can get past him.  I don't expect to score six goals a game, but one goal on 80 quality shots is ridiculous.  Shot aiming is hard at first, but I got it down and still couldn't score.  Then there's the fighting.  Don't even bother.  Punching is done with the right stick, but half the time it's unresponsive and the other half it's inaccurate.  I try to punch and it does nothing, or try but swing to a different spot than I aimed for and whiff completely, getting knocked out when wide open.  If controllers didn't cost so much I would have thrown mine several times.

I have logged around 15 hours of play time, and really wanted to like this game.  I kept telling myself I would eventually get used to the controls, but it never happened.  I spent more of my energy fighting the controls than enjoying the game, and when they lead to giving up a bad goal you have no hope of making up, it's the worst kind of frustration.  Each time I scored I thought ""maybe there's hope"", but then came the flaws and god-like goalie to remind me I would only win if the game ""let me"".  I played on the ""pro"" setting, which is akin to normal, and wins and losses were never in my hands either way.  One-timers, breakaways, dekes, nothing seems to influence the ability to score.  I tried 3-on-0 rushes in practice mode and still seldom scored.  In one game I scored 8 goals despite doing nothing different, then went back to being shut down.  Everything in NHL 10 is immersive except the gameplay.  The love affair EA Sports has with the analog sticks needs to end.

2.0,False,"08 27, 2004",A2X8KN82L07RSK,B00020V4NK,C. Johnson,"It seems EA will never fix their obvious AI problems.  Yet each year they add more gimmicks without fixing one of the main problems in their football game.

I haven't bought Madden since Madden 03, and I will not buy another Madden title until they fix the AI problems.  I am sick of having CPU's sub par running backs breaking 5 and 6 tackles on 3rd and 6 just so they can get a first down.  QBs breaking tackles from LBs who outweight them by 100 pounds.  How about the CPU always allowing your CB's to be out of position when the CPU passes the ball, and on top of that, they slow the CB down to give the receiver a better chance to catch the ball!  Sub par receivers making leaping one handed catches in tight coverage while getting hit.  Passes going through defenders' bodies, helmets, hands, legs, arms etc. to end up in the receiver's hands.  Balls changing direction in mid air just so the receiver can catch it.  The CPU intentionally making tacklers dive in the opposite direction you expect them to, turning a would be minimal 2 or 3 yard gain into a maddening 20 yard gain.  Your defenders all seem to be conntected by a string so if you go in and dive to make a sack and miss (and most of the time you will miss or the QB will miracously break the tackle), your defender who is guarding the intended receiver, will automatically dive too if you switch to him, resulting in a BS 50+ yard TD pass.  The CPU automatically moving your linemen across the line on 3rd and 10, to give the offense a free 5 yard and then the CPU gets exactly 5 yards on the next play.  CPU QB's getting off perfect passes while having a LB inches from taking him down.

If your offense you have to deal with your all star 95+ rated receivers dropping wide open passes.  All star QBs throwing balls out of bounds. All star RB's fumbling at the worse possible time.  You lineman are moved across the line by the CPU and you get flagged for a false start.  Your linemen miss obvious blocks so big gains are rare in a close game. Your QB automatically tucks the ball and takes a sack if a defender is 10 feet away, while the CPU QB can get a perfect pass off while he's being sacked almost.  Psychic defense that almost always know what play your going to run.  Refs almost always get in the way of your receiver when you absolutely need to convert a 3rd down.

And who can forget the infamous comeback AI?  No lead is safe.  Even if your up by 20+ points at the half, your better off running the clock out starting in the 3rd quarter because the AI will do any and everything to get the lead and screw you; that includes your offense fumbling the ball, receivers dropping wide open passes, refs constantly calling clipping and holding on you after you get a good punt return or big gain.  Refs calling you for face mask penalties or pass interference after you stop the CPU on third down so the CPU can get a free first down, bad calls in the final two minutes of the game so you can't challenge.

On special teams I have seen where I was lined up for the game winning field goal and I see my play clock is about to run out, so I call a timeout with 2 seconds left on the clock. The screen signals that I called a timeout, but a few moments after I call a timeout, the ref throws a flag AFTER the timeout was called. and I get pushed back five yards. Talk about a LATE whistle. Another occasion the CPU punted to me, and the ball CLEARLY went out of bounds at the 35 yard line. It was way beyond the side line and in fact nearly to the end of the thick white line; however the ball bounced back in bounds and the CPU downed it at the 21 yard line. I was so shocked, that I saved the replay. No matter what this CPU does to screw me, they always do one better everytime I play the game.

I have experienced these things and more in Madden.  More so on defense.  while these problems certainly don't happen in every game, it happens on average every other game.  Sometimes the CPU will cheat on every single down making it impossible to win. Most of the time however, I can usually still win in spite of the cheating, it is still very frustrating when the CPU can constantly pull 60, 70 and 80 YD TD passes out their a$$ just so the game will be close.  This ruins the experience of an otherwise fun game.  I still play 2003, because I want to at least get my money's worth and play all 30 seasons while drafting college players from NCAA 2003.  After that, I will never even think about purchasing or playing another Madden or NCAA title again.

For me, gone are the days that I rush out and buy the current year's sports title.  It is usually the same game as the previous one.  However, if you absolutely want a football title this year, get ESPN, and while it has its problems too, it is certainly a much better deal being only 20 bucks versus 50 bucks for Madden.

Since the folks at EA are shaking in the fear of a little competition from ESPN, they have decided to purchase the NFL liscense exclusively for themselves so no other companies can make NFL games.  Because of this I suppose I won't be buying any football titles for the next 5 years.  Even IF EA fixed their obvious game problems during these 5 years, I STILL wouldn't buy Madden or NCAA ever again.  I don't even know if I will buy another EA game period.

I don't think I've ever awaited a game's publication with as much eagerness as I did this one. For months I had primed everyone that *this* was what I wanted for my Birthday, then Christmas. Deadlines slipped away like very slippery things.

Then I finally had the game in my hands. I installed it on my XP machine, it booted and the ship landed in my house. The robot major domo disembarked and talked me into boarding and I thought ""the animation isn't up to much"". Then the ship launched and the magnificent opening credits rolled and the music filled the air.

And so the battle was on and the suckage began to manifest slowly but inexorably. I'll cut to the chase.

The artwork was in places very good, and in others so bad as to defeat comprehension of what I was looking at. The track across the ceiling is a case in point. I had visited the control room several times before I cottoned on to the fact that it was in the ceiling rose. The perspective is unhelpful and you can't look around when you are on the stairs.

The puzzles were okay, logic puzzles for the most part that anyone could figure out by just taking a long enough look, dressed in such a way as to make them seem harder than they were.

Solving those puzzles so the game would move on could be a little more challenging (as in bloody annoying) because of Stupid Design Decisions That Should Not Be.

Example: Zones too small in almost every puzzle. Often I would find I had actually solved the puzzle but could not enact my solution because the hot zone for the mouse click or drag action was ludicrously undersized. The photo and the autopilot stand out here.

Example: Idiotic text adventure style approaches to visual puzzles like the one where I'm asking the bell boy to get something for me. I know where the thing is and what it is, I know I have to ask the bell boy to get it. But it turns out unless I phrase the request *just so* while standing in an exact spot and no other it won't work.

Example: The robots whose attitudes decay as time goes on. The above puzzle could still have been worked out without complete loss of temper if the decision to make the bell boy become uncooperative after three attempts, requiring a boring and tedious and stupid trip to the far-off place to fix that before trying again, had not been taken. This might have been the place where I resorted to the cheat book (and thus ruined the payoff).

Example: The politics of publicly announcing that the game would be sold for the Mac first, then having to do a hasty port to the PC when the money ran out thus satisfying no-one. Everywhere you look in the game there is evidence of The Early Bath. Symmetric corridors of which only one can be explored. Clue dumps where multiple items can be recovered. Poor graphics at odds with other art in the game.

The player interface was adequate to the task, but incorporated nothing startlingly clever. A notebook capability or a camera might have gone some way to alleviating the tedium, but probably not. The thinking seems to have been to make life difficult at every stage.

Adams was fascinated by the misanthropic nature of the service industry, as can be seen by a brief skimming of his work. He loved the ironic in-your-faceness of it all. What he apparently was unable to see was that a book can be plotted so that that works to enthrall the reader, whereas confronting the gamer with it just makes them want to phone him in the night to shout rude words. There's a difference between frustration for its own sake and challenge.

Having gone to the trouble of making the robots converse adequately, why nobble them so hard with the ridiculously short ""safe period"" in which they cooperated with the player? What should have been a clever resource and possible source of misunderstandings for comical effect was instead just annoying. A waste of programming time and money.

By the time I got to the bridge I was in no mood to be ****ed about. I spent thirty minutes trying to feed the photo to the autopilot and then read the cheatbook to find that I was doing the right thing, I just hadn't found the exact group of pixels inside the obvious graphic over which to do it. I felt no joy at finishing the game this way, I just wanted it over and done with.

How someone who could create the Seasonal Garden (and I would have liked to be able to walk in there of course) and the enchanting music room could have screwed it all up with the stupids is beyond me.

And the game is buggy. The codec used in SP1 means it won't run at all out of the box (there was a download to address this that works) and the bar scene crashed repeatedly on my machine.

The box blurb raved about how you'd want to talk to the robots because of the parser they'd used in them, but even when tuned to be cooperative they  were not compelling conversationalists and, like I say, their attitudes decayed so fast they weren't useful or entertaining.

In fact, I can safely say that Adams had lost the sale of future products on the strength of my experience with this one. Of course, sadly he passed away and his future projects became moot.

Good idea, poorly executed with inadequate playtesting and hurried port.

Yea, you backtrack alot.
If you guys have ever played winback, that game where the objective is to backtrack half the time, this game outdoes even winback.
Ok so the game is basically a first person shooter. It is linear, There are seperate paths you can go, but you usually will have to stop shortly after because you need a special gizmo or gadget.
You don't really need to scan that much to win, even though in the first level they make it seem like you will. Basically you shoot monsters, find things to make your suit do more, and fight bosses for those things, then backtrack.
The game has alot of shooting, contrary to what other people say. You will shoot alot of monsters by rapidly clicking the powerbeam button. Eventually, I just started using missles, because every time you kill a guy he leaves something. Well, they don't always leave things, but usually they will leave a health up or missle up. I think it depends on what weapon you use to kill the actual monster.
The pros of the game are the great environments. It isn't the same over and over again, actually the backtracking screws that up. You could of gone through tons of different environments, instead you backtrack between like 5 of them, mabye 6. Then there are the graphics, pretty good. The weapons are alright, I love just pounding guys with missles. The morph ball works well, you can use it whenever you want. Then there is the help system. Usually it tells you when there is a save system nearby, and your next objective. Most of the time I am not lost, but sometimes it tells me to go 5 miles to where I just came from and I feel like throwing the game in the garbage.
However, the cons of the game greatly out-due all the good things. The control is weird at first, but once you master it, it becomes better. Still, there are points in the game when the control works against you. Say there is a monster shootiong at you from behind. You can't really turn around and keep moving left and right, so you usually will get shot a couple times. Cleared areas usually leave some really tough enemies, that gang up on you and you die. That's another problem, the monsters can be really tough. Usually you can't just shoot the monsters. Most of the time you will have to find a weakness or wait till it turns around and shoot it's back.
The overall layout of the game is even worst. Boss, new item, backtrack. You will probably fight 20 bosses in the game. You can get a few energy cell boosters, and missle pack boosters. The only thing is, most of them require you to go out of your way for them. Backtracking isn't that big during the first hour or so of the game, but let me tell you something, it gets worse. You go to this iceworld to get a speed ball reward, then you go ALL THE WAY BACK to your ship. If you play the game and get to the speed ball part, you will know what I am talking about.
Besides backtracking and such, the problem is death. Die, reload from last save point saved at. The one problem that could of been avoided easily. Say you get killed? Ok, you can't just continue from the beggining of that boss fight, you are going to have to reload. Say you fight some of the tough enemies, reload. Say you play for 2 hours to get a powerup then die, reload. I think you understand.
In closing, the backtracking makes the game bad. The dieing makes the game bad. I wouldn't of minded a shorter game with no backtracking. I wouldn't have minded a retry system for bosses. But these problems overshadow all the good things in the game, and make it not worth playing. Sorry metroid, better luck next time.

2.0,False,"04 25, 2013",ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00175GC4K,Micheal Hunt,"I'd just like to say, before you read this review, that my review of this game is more about the differences between this version and the previous 2008 version. I hope this review will help out those who love SvR2008 and are wondering if 2009 is a worthy upgrade to purchase or not?

Not a great deal has been changed in 2009 compared to the predecessor. Expected changes of coarse are changes to rosters and what superstars you can select. However more or less much is identical to the last game, however this version does not include any WWE Legends as extra characters; so do not expect to find The Rock or Stone Cold Steve Austin. Apart from that, the only updates I can see to the move sets seem to be you can now whip and an opponent into the corner, and when you run at them, you can toss them down and climb the turnbuckle as a combination move.

With that said, you might possibly think; well, if I want legends I should go with 2008, or if I don't want them, go with 2009. However that is not so much the case, as I did find many things in 2009 that I am really not happy about.

The first being glitches or programmers bungling their codes. It seems they didn't have very good testers as I discovered in the Elimination Chamber match, you cannot climb the turnbuckles. In 2008 you can, and then you can go from there and climb up onto the cages behind you for an aerial assault, but in 2009 they messed this up and you cannot get on the top ropes anymore in that match. If that did not sound bad enough, then here is a major reason to minus overall points from 2009; In 2008 it was always fun to go outside the ring, rip off the announce tables top, preform a strong left or right grapple (eg: choke slam), get your opponent up, walk them into the table, and send them crashing through it. In 2009, if you are close enough, your opponent might slap into the table, but it will not break. WTH THQ? One of the best features people loved in 2008 is ruined for 2009. BUT WAIT, there is still more! IF you give your opponent an Irish-whip to try and get them onto the table (you would whip them and they would roll onto the table) guess what? Your opponent rolls on the edge of the table, glitches as they move through the air, and land back on the mat next to the table. SERIOUSLY, THQ, DID YOU NOT TEST YOUR OWN PROGRAMMING? How could you mess that up? I have a feeling the code that is conflicting with is, in 2008 when both opponents where on top of the announce tables, playing in an Extreme Rules match, if one player had a finisher, you could execute it, and your player would enter the ring and jump off the top turnbuckle to the player on the table, causing it to break. Now that option seems to be available in every match. Hence not allowing you to preform your actual finisher on the table anymore.

Next thing I noticed was ""Hardcore"" has been deleted from the match options. It's no real biggie, as any match you can turn DQ off can become a hardcore match, and playing on the ECW show is a hardcore match just about every time anyway. Also deleted is the ""Buried Alive"" match. Personally, I never liked that match anyway, it was too simple and no fun. In there place they have added a 6 man Battle Royal. Really? 6 men in an over the top rope elimination match? BORING. They should have just given the option to say tossing your opponent over the top rope to the mat is an elimination, they did not actually need to make a match for it. Battle Royals consist of 10 to 50 men in the ring, but here you can play as 6, which let's be honest, would not attract ratings on a real wrestling show, so why would anyone wanna play it?

When it comes to creating your wrestlers; pretty much the only updates have been to logos. I can now choose the original DX shirt logos for front and back, but there should have been so much more other than just new hats and beards added. There is not a great deal of new things to create with, and what is new you probably would not use unless you enjoy making the whackiest characters possible.

Now a major bummer is when choosing your moves for your CAW, so many moves are missing from the game. There is no Sharpshooter/Scorpion Death Lock... I mean, I can understand that because Hulk Hogan is not in the game, I might not be able to find ""The atomic Leg Drop"" finisher, but just because Bret Hart is not in this game, why would you remove the ""Sharpshooter""? It makes absolutely no sense. It is possible the move is in the game somewhere, as I did notice there was 3 sets of extra CAW moves that can be unlocked if you do such and such in Road To Wrestlemania, but come on, why do they hide moves at all? No one in the real world beginning wrestling training is told they cannot preform certain moves until they have had 20 matches under their belt, it doesn't work that way, so why does THQ keep making you unlock these moves? But on a final note to the Sharpshooter, there doesn't seem to be a spot indicated with ""??????"" under where Sharpshooter or Scorpion Death Lock would be inserted. So I have my doubts the move is in the game at all. Even the Rock is not in this game, so his version wouldn't be included either. So who knows how many moves have been deleted in this version that where all included in the previous version.

Now, 2008 introduced the ""24/7 mode"" as your main career mode, where you play as a wrestler for as long as you like during each day of the year... that has been removed from this game, and they have instead introduced ""Road to Wrestlemania"" You can only pick 1 of about 8 wrestlers to compete in 82 matches or so to complete their quest. They have made better cut scenes and videos for these guys compared to 2008, but personally, some of these wrestlers I am not fans of, and do not want to play 82 matches with them just to unlock things. I really am not a fan of CM Punk, but I had to bore myself till his 10th match to unlock a backstage area for exhibition mode. Quite frankly, it was not worth it, as the two backstage areas of this game are a joke. In 2009 you had a part to the top right of the screen in some matches where you could exit the ring and go there to have some fun throwing your opponent into electrical equipment, and watching them blow up, or climb a scaffold and crash through them on a table, or receive weapons from people in the crowed... there was also a backstage parking lot brawl that was cool, if only you could turn KO off, but you could whip your opponent into things and find hot spots to preform certain area moves, or even just grapple them into one, but in 2009 you get a backstage storage area, where there is very little you can do in the area at all. You can whip them into a barrel that just moves around, a few bins that just roll over, a box that you can find maybe 2 weapons in, and a TV that does not explode. There is also a table and a ladder. However the area is not fun and boring as can be, there are no hot spots to preform cool area moves, there nothing to even dive off of. The second waste of time was unlocked the locker room, where again, no hot spots, you can just whip someone into the lockers and a weapon will fall down, or you can whip them into a TV or pot plant. God THQ, how is it ""Smackdown: Here comes the Pain"" ""Just Bring It"" and the other one can have such awesome backstage areas allowing you to go to the boiler room, parking lot, outside the arena, in the foyer, offices and what not, but a game made nearly 10 years later is given this rubbish as backstage areas? Please someone explain how they can be so idiotic to think the backstage areas in this game here would be fun to anyone?

There was a couple of things in 2008 that annoyed me, like whipping opponents into certain areas where they would not even collide into anything, such as the announce area once tables are gone, or anywhere up the ramp to the stage. You would think that would have been updated wouldn't you? Nope. It's the same, your opponent just jogs on the spot till the stop and turn around like nothing happened.

One cool thing about this game is the new ""Create a Finisher"". It's not bad, it's easy to figure out, however it is pretty limited and I could not create the move I wanted, but others may have a lot of fun creating them more than I did.

The Tournament modes have been brought back, However the ""King of The Ring"" has been ruined. It was OK in 2008 as you could simulate straight to your match and then you where shown a video of you accepting your crown... that's gone from 2009 and you also have to go to each match to simulate results for it. Just annoying. At least load times for this game are quicker than 2008, so that's one advantage, of very few.

Commentary doesn't seem to be updated much, I think they used a lot of what was already in 2008 and just added a few new ones here and there. Still becomes pretty annoying after a while hearing the same thing all the time, but god I wish they would remove the ""You won't see this kind of action on Smackdown"" or ""Do you think Raw will have anything this exciting next week?"" those must be some of the most irritating things to hear all the time in any commentary of any game, and they kept it for 2009! Sheesh.

There is also a mode for playing a small career as any wrestler you want. However it only consists of about 6 matches for each belt. Mostly what this mode is for is building your stats for a created superstar. The more of certain things you do in certain matches builds your attributes. Very easy to do, but I'd have preferred the ""WWE SHOP"" to return to just buy the points needed.

Well, that's about all I got to say about this game. In my personal opinion, I think the previous years 'Smackdown vs Raw' game was a much better game. Matches worked flawlessly, had better wrestlers (legends) and more moves to choose from. Had only 2008 introduced the create a finisher mode, and the aerial moves that can be preformed off the top of the ""Hell In a Cell"" then 2009 would have received a 1 star rating from me.",Bows Down to 2008,1366848000,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'}",

1.) The controls are obnoxious: I want to draw the string on my bow,but instead I kick. I want to unsheath my dagger,but instead I take out my club. Many times the game will tell you what buttons to push (push down on the crosspad to draw your weapon) but even when you do,nothing happens. Also the spell casting is even more horrid than the melee and ranged attacking.

2.)Glitches... so many glitches: The ""hero"" of this adventure will walk around in short circles and pace back and forth when the game switches to a cutscene with another character. It's hard to take the game dialouge seriously when the main character looks like he is doing a wee wee dance. C'mon! At least have the camera and the character centered correctly.

Also another glitch happened to me early in the game that I have to report. When I was on my way to see the prophet,there is a bridge that must be brought up with magic. But because the hero walks off on his own when talking to another character,I ended up falling off about twenty feet! Funny thing is that the game still tried to carry on the conversation with the character at the end of the bridge wayyyy up above me. So to try to fix the situation,I just pressed a button;next thing I know I am in a crypt trying to burn up skeletons with a crappy magic system that doesn't work.

3.)Motion blur: I don't know who the ad wizard was that came up with this one,but it is terrible. I'm sorry but it doesn't look realistic,it just makes you want to barf and gives you a headache,and there aren't any options to shut it off.

4.)Teleporting when you ""aren't going the right way"": This seems like a feature that would have been added on in a game that was made ten years ago. At first I didn't understand what was going on,but then after walking a short distance in the same area for about fifteen times....oh I see,going to this spot is a no no. So much for open exploration!

All this game really has going for it is some nice graphics,but that's like wanting to watch someone throw up a rainbow. The orc chick was kind of hot too,but I don't know about the others;to me they just seemed like Shrek with anger managment issues.

Also the whole satanic pentagram on the throne room's carpet in the opening scene was a bit much for my taste,but that's just me.

My advice is to save your money and try your luck with something like Trinity, Hyperdemension Neptunia or better yet,wait for Dragon Age 2.

The game is fun overall.  Multiplayer is a fun experience, even despite the repetitive nature of it.  I had previously complained that the game was so unbalanced, they had to remove dozens of units from the multiplayer experience.  Even with them out, multiplayer is still GROSSLY unbalanced.  Units like the Thor and the Void Ray are ridiculously overpowered compared to virtually every other unit, and they have no real counter; the Zerg have no counter for them---Hydralisks are inexplicably weak against Void Rays, Mutalisks are killed far too easily, and Thors have a hidden splash attack with their Anti-Air missiles, which does double damage to light units (ie, mutalisks).  This attack is to Void Rays and Mutalisks what fire is to rice paper.

There is no unit balance as Starcraft had; it's become an arms race; first person to spam Thors or Void Rays wins.

*****

And to think the biggest worry I had upon seeing screenshots early on was that the buildings and units looked so bloated, fat, and cartoony.  In fact they do seem rather bloated and cartoony compared to their Starcraft counterparts, but it's not nearly as horrendous as I'd initially thought it out to be.

To get the easy stuff out of the way: If you care not for the story and only for the gameplay, then 3 stars out of 5 is a fair rating.

I don't know why Starcraft was so innovative a game as it was.  It simply looked different, smooth and was extremely well-balanced.  It was a slick game with easily identifiable units on the field with easily identifiable sounds, weapons, and controls and interface.  It was an innovation and improvement over the engine used in Warcraft II.

Here, there is none.  They claimed to have completely re-made the engine from scratch, but you could copy and paste the UI onto Command & Conquer 3 or Command & Conquer 4 and it would look pretty much the same.  It's not at all a bad thing, but it's not really a good thing either if you're looking to play this as a new game.  It essentially feels like C&C3 with cartoonier units.

The game mechanics that went into making Starcraft so incredibly balanced will have to be re-discovered here, as new units are frequent in coming, old units have stats changed, and units like the Medic become essential for infantry squads, as they auto-heal when you move or attack-move them with a group, rather than wandering out up into an enemy because you'd need to micro-manage them directly.

Initially I'd have considered the Protoss terribly, horribly, atrociously overpowered due to weapons like the Colossus and the Void Ray, but later missions showed that there was more to come for Zerg and Terran to even the odds.  This, however, says very very little for traditional defensive units like the Photon Cannon, Bunkers, and units like the Zealot.  You may as well not even make them anymore, unless you plan on massing them in gargantuan numbers, as they contribute next to nothing within huge armies, whereas in Starcraft, the melee abilities of a Zealot made it essential under a Defiler's swarm ability, or for fast attacks.

But the absolute bane of this entry of the franchise is undoubtedly the writing.

Virtually everything Jim Raynor or Tychus Findlay or Matt Horner says can be found in one line or another from any other movie, TV show, or video game.  There's almost nothing anyone says that isn't cliche', stupid, poorly delivered, or so bland and generic you can skip it and miss out on nothing.

Remember Arcturus Mengsk.  Remember Mengsk of Korhal, and how the Confederacy nuked Korhal into an uninhabitable wasteland.  Remember how Mengsk fought and bled and suffered to fight them, with his rebel group the Sons of Korhal.  He was a character so morally ambiguous that he would suffer in order to help civilians, and then out of utter rage and vengeance, use psi emitters to obliterate entire Confederate planets, drawing billions of Zerg onto Antigua Prime and Tarsonis.

He wanted to (and successfully did) end the war and end the Confederacy, and not end up spending decades fighting hard guerrilla war with the Confederate remnants.  He mad a bad decision, it was the wrong one, but he made it, and he was going to live with it.  He was like Joseph Stalin in his ceaseless aggression to power and to the safety and security of all Terrans.

The Arcturus Mengsk in Starcraft 2 is better compared with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  He and his administration create laws so blatantly false and outrageous, even CHILDREN would not fall for it.  And this is presented CONSTANTLY in the form of UNN broadcasts featuring an obvious parody of news pundits.  One mission sees you, Raynor's rebels, liberate a civilian area from the Zerg and Dominion forces.  This is then reported on the news where a field reporter reports to the UNN pundit.  He then asks about civilian casualties, and the reporter says ""Actually, the only civilian casualties thus far have been crossfire from overzealous Dominion forces"" and as soon as she finishes, they panickedly go back to the pundit who panickedly remarks ""Uh, well, there you have it ladies and gentlemen; Jim Raynor, killing innocent women and children!""

The actions of Arcturus Mengsk, having civilians rounded up and slaughtered, or encouraging neighbors to spy on one another, or abandoning half his Dominion  at the first sign of Zerg threat so as to protect his core worlds, is so completely out of character for the Starcraft Mengsk that it's a farce.  It's buffoonery, and it's made less funny if you've played the Terran campaign in Starcraft 1.

But the absolute worst has to be Zeratul and the Protoss.

In Starcraft, the Protoss were the big tough fanatical race.  They were loyal, courageous, religious, and xenophobic.  They had highly advanced technology, but otherwise were very much like the Terrans in terms of being well-rounded, with good people and bad people making good decisions and bad decisions.

In Starcraft 2, you could replace them with night elves in World of Warcraft or any random race of wizards or magicians from any medieval fantasy work involving people speaking with stunted syllables about ancient prophecies and fallen ones and doom.

TVTropes has something called ""Flanderization"", named for Ned Flanders in ""The Simpsons"", who believe it or not, was once a NORMAL character who was religious, but also did ""naughty"" things and drank beer and such.  ""Flanderization"" refers to taking ONE character trait of an otherwise normal character, and making that trait THE defining characteristic of it, to the exclusion of all else.

This has happened BIG TIME with the Protoss, where religious fanaticism and mysticism has now become the defining trait of the Protoss.  Nothing Zeratul (or Nibbler, as I call him, because he's voiced by the same actor) says is not painful to listen to, straight out of every Lord of the Rings knockoff, good or bad, and done worse.

Mild Spoilers abound here:  For whatever reason, whereas Raynor and the Terrans are written at a third grade level of vocabulary and storytelling, Zeratul is written at a kindergarten level.  It becomes teeth-gnashingly irritating to have a cutscene show you where to go, and to have Zeratul SLOWLY exclaim ""I must go over there and link with that thing, but there are Zerg in the way!  They may be... problematic"", or a mission where Zerg attack your base every three minutes, and when there's thirty seconds left, Zeratul ALWAYS says ""The Zerg are massing for an attack!  To arms!""

Zeratul's fight with Kerrigan is not so much a fight as a World of Warcraft-looking cutscene featuring an exchange of magic pixie powers---I mean, ""psionic energy""

And then comes Zeratul's FIRST crowning moment of stupidity (because there's at least two) that comes as such a smack in the face to Starcraft fans, it becomes less the fault of the character, and more the fault of BAD WRITING.  Zeratul encounters a Protoss/Zerg Hybrid, and then states in that stilted, bland and monotonous delivery ""Who could have created such a thing?""

DID NO ONE ON THE WRITING STAFF EVEN READ THE SCRIPTS OF THE FIRST GAME, NOT EVEN NEEDING TO PLAY IT?

So while you're saying ""Duran"" again and again and again, the next mission comes and here's Zeratul's stupidity that is again the fault of bad writing, not because of total ignorance of the first game, but out of just bad writing:

Zeratul encounters the ""ghost"" of an old friend.  The FIRST THING this old friend says is ""I have come to you from beyond this world"", and the FIRST THING Zeratul says is ""But you died!""

The idiocy then continues as this old friend tells the story of the Overmind and its true purpose, and Zeratul chimes in POINTLESS commentary that only shows how utterly STUPID he is, not able to use age as an excuse to not understand the concept of ""lies"" and ""ulterior motives"" and ""not everything is as it seems"".  The old friend remarks something about the Overmind, and Zeratul says ""DUH DUH BUT, THE, OVERMIND, WAS, A, MONSTROSITY!"" and this old friend has to chide Zeratul like a child that it only SEEMED this way to him.

I remark on World of Warcraft and magical fantasy a lot in this review.  Know that I am not trashing on the genre, or on World of Warcraft.  It is likely a fine game, but my point is that it is an entirely different genre game from this.  The same way you wouldn't want to see rubber-forehead aliens in ""Battlestar Galactica"" or slapstick comedy in ""Schindler's List"", I don't want to see magical fantasy-type superstition and talks of ""Prophecy"", ""Chosen One"", ""Fallen One"", ""the Damned"", ""Doom"", and such in a hard science fiction game.

In fact Starcraft 2 does seem at times like that one disastrous step that Warcraft 3 did with the series; turning it from low-fantasy into high-fantasy, which actually went on to greater things in acquiring a whole new fanbase with World of Warcraft.

It doesn't fit on Starcraft 2.  And seeing the Starcraft series go from something dark, ambiguous, and hard, to something literally at grade-school level in its simplicity, is like watching a childhood hero succumb to drugs or alcohol.",Like watching a childhood hero succumb to vice,1281398400,95,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Bad: Boring story, broken stealth mechanics, technical flaws

I have really given this game some time and I tried to forgive it. I rented this on Xbox 360 when it first came out and gave up after the second level. I bought this as a cheap Steam sale about a year ago and have just had it sitting on my HDD since then. I have gone back here and there to try to beat or continue this game. I just can't do it and have finally given up. After two years of giving this game a chance I doubt it will become better over time. The paper-thin story, poor stealth mechanics, and technical flaws just bring this promising game down.

You play as a British spy infiltrating Germany during World War II and other occupied territories for...I don't know really. The story is presented in flashbacks that don't really explain much other than why Violet is at that current location. You have various goals you have to complete, but there are enemies in between that you have to kill off or avoid. A stealth game has to have great stealth mechanics like sneaking, killing, and gadgets which Velvet fails in every category. First off, she moves way to slow when crouching. You can never catch up to enemies who are walking because they just leave her in the dust. This is extremely difficult when you are trying to quickly kill someone before you are spotted. The kill moves are pretty cool, but you have to be in the exact position the game needs you to be before you can trigger it. You also have to be extremely close which is ridiculous. This isn't Splinter Cell where you can trigger the kill at a reasonable distance.

You get a few items to help you kill these Nazis. You can use Morphine shots to become invisible, freeze time, and do an automatic kill. This is useful for a guard that has spotted so you can take him down really quick. You get a silenced pistol, but ammo is hard to come by so use it wisely. Some times you can also use a Nazi uniform as a disguise, but if you get too close to enemies they will recognize you. The game has shadow stealth which means if you hide in the shadows you will have a blue aura around you and enemies won't see you. This game has some of the dumbest enemy AI I have ever seen. You can whistle to lure a guard to some shadows but he won't see you even though you are two feet in front of him. If you are seen and try to hide the enemies know exactly where you are and you can't hide from them. What kind of lame crap is that?

The game looks good and has a nice visual art style, but there are some technical flaws here. Animations are pretty bad with some terrible sound effects. The footsteps all sounds the same and the animations just seems floaty and canned. I also found some of the guards patrols to be very long and the overall patterns are hard to work around. It's difficult to figure out how to take out enemies because there are no natural hints or obvious paths most of the time.

Overall, Velvet Assassin was a promising stealth action game set in World War II but has a pointless story, broken stealth mechanics, and some technical flaws. The game looks good, but other than that there is no reason for you to pick this up. Rent this if you want to play a stealth game with a sexy protagonist, otherwise look elsewhere.","Great ideas, but a poor stealth action game",1341446400,,,

Everything looks incredible in HD on the PS3.  You can tell a lot of attention to detail has gone into the way it looks and feels/plays.  The movement of the skiers down the slalom is very realistic, there's a good learning curve with the Parallel Snowboard Slalom which will keep you busy, and the sense of speed on the bobsleigh events is really well done.  Unlike Beijing Olympics 2008, the mindless fast-tapping on controller buttons is kept to a minimum on Vancouver 2010.  Online play is a lot of fun as this game seems to be very popular in Europe, so you'll get to play against some good (European) players.

That's the good.  Now let's check out the bad...

The biggest disappointment with this game is the number of events that are included.  The range of events is really quite poor.  There is NO halfpipe snowboarding event for example meaning no opportunity to perform tricks or show off your snowboarding skills.  Snowboarding is probably going to be one of the MOST WATCHED events, yet SEGA only decided to include the Snowboard Cross event and no HalfPipe.  There's no figure skating event, no ice hockey content, no curling, no biathlon, and no cross-country skiing.  Yes, I appreciate something like Ice Hockey is so complex that it would need a whole game/disc by itself, but not even some small presence such as a penalty shootout?  While the game lists ""14 events"", most of these are very similar.  The Bobsleigh, Luge and Skeleton are practically the same event (just a different vehicle/sled) and most of the skiing and snowboarding events are the same.

Vancouver 2010 is fun to play, especially online, but it quickly becomes monotonous playing the same events over and over. Pricing this game at $49.99 is ridiculous.  They would sell more copies AND it would be more value for money if they sold it for half that price, $25. But when will we learn?  We all know that any licensed Olympic game is fun short term, but quickly loses it's appeal.  If you are curious about this game, I would say give it a miss.  If you are a die-hard Olympics fan and want to immerse yourself in the Winter Olympics, then I would say ONLY get this game if you can rent it or buy a used copy.  It's simply not worth it for $[...].  All-in-all, it's a very disappointing game and totally overpriced.

In the game for some characters the player can't do some of the moves as good as the CPU, and the moves do not respond to the D-pad on time.
And there are several glitches in the game as well for instance; As I was in practice mode in some arenas the player or opponent can fall threw walls or in some areas where there are big holes in the floor where you can actually walk on them and not fall, or get trapped in a wall. And as if that was not bad enough they did a pore job on the blocking move, it too dose not respond on time. They have where you can reconfigure your controls on the game (Yeah, a lot of good that dose.) But you still don't have the blocking move to where you don't have to strain the hell out of your fingers just to do one stupid move.
And as for the affects, its a joke and I'll give you an example; In the game Blood Roar Extreme, the lighting in the game looks far more real as to X-men Storm's lighting balls, they look more like balls of yarn. And there fighting stances are just flat out bad. Some players can float just over there heads witch doesn't make sense because not only that, you can't really hit them anymore and it gives your enemy an open shot at you.

I had also played a demo of one of the Monkey Island games and found it hilarious.  I greedily slapped down my ten bucks and looked forward to some fun.

The game is fun to listen to and watch.  Filled with yucks aplenty, Grim Fandango is like participating directly in a wacky animated film.  For this alone, Fandango earns high praise.  As with the Monkey Island games, the voice acting and humor is top notch.

Sadly, gameplay suffers.  If you read through enough reviews here at Amazon, you'll find that people like Fandango simply for its humor and style; most customers admit that they needed walkthroughts to get past the game's frustrating puzzles.  I'm a puzzle fan, and I like a challenge, but there were simply too many moments in Fandango where the puzzles felt arbitrary. Logic rarely led to a solution; only trial and error did!  For me, this weighed heavily--and I mean heavily--against the game.  Humor and style, huge plusses no doubt, should still be secondary to gameplay (or at least equal).  With Fandango, gameplay seems to be a less important means towards creative and hilarious ends.  You'll need to decide if this is okay with you. For me, it wasn't.

2.0,True,"04 3, 2011",A29B7FU5QYXY5E,B004K1EA5Q,Milleria,"Please note: I have never played a samurai warriors title before. And I have only played this one for about four hours so far. That said, I tend to enjoy JRPGs more than most Americans, so I was surprised by how much this game bothered me.

Samurai warriors: Chronicles was the first 3DS game I bought. I am usually more of a ""hardcore"" gamer, so games like Steel Diver and Pilotwings resort from the 3DS launch lineup did not appeal to me. This one looked fun. And it is somewhat fun - if you can stomach the hours of horrible story before you actually kill anything. Seriously, expect to spend at least 30 minutes listening to bad story at the start of the game before you get to do anything at all... and this trend repeats for every. single. mission. UPDATE: I was recently informed by a commenter who timed it that there is exactly seven minutes of story before you can play. It just feels like a half hour. I stand by my statement that the introduction is painfully long for a handheld.

The story might not be so bothersome if they bothered to localize it into English. They have voice actors, but they are all speaking Japanese. The cutscenes contain zero action or anything exciting, so I found myself spamming the A button while doing something else for 30 (excuse me, 7) minutes waiting to be able to play the game. Seven minutes of non-playable story might be okay for a console, but it is too much for a handheld.

Once you actually begin a mission, you will find some fun(ish), hack-and-slash style combat where you get to attack hordes of enemies with big swords. There is a loot and leveling system that keeps the game somewhat interesting. Except none of the items seem to make a significant difference in your gameplay. And the controls are unresponsive at best - I really never got the hang of what I was supposed to be doing with the R or A buttons. Each character has different abilities, but I have no idea what they do. Perhaps this was explained in the cutscenes that I skipped, but I doubt it.

The game is very fast paced, with frequent side-missions coming up. Which brings me to my next gripe about the localization. This game is played on a system with two screens, so you are already looking at two places. The top screen is 3D, which means that there is a lot to see on that screen. But every time a character says anything (often useful tips about where you need to go next), you have to read the subtitles because the developers were too lazy (cheap) to hire a localization team. So you're looking at the top 3D screen, the bottom screen, and trying to figure out what you are supposed to do, all at the same time because you have NO IDEA what anyone is saying. I know some people do not like voice actors because they tend to sound really cheesy, but they are really required for gameplay here. I would strongly prefer some very bad voice acting to this alternative.

Seriously, Koei, I cannot stress this enough: you NEED to hire English voice actors for these games! For the cutscenes it is just a bothersome nuisance, but for the gameplay I actually felt hindered because I do not speak Japanese. I know Samurai Warriors games are much more popular in Japan, and the reason seems incredibly obvious to me.

Graphics: 9/10 (very nice looking 3D for a launch title, although it provides little tactical advantage like most 3D games)
Gameplay: 5/10 (fun, fast-paced hack-and slash hindered by awkward controls)
Story: 0/10 (it's painful. really, really painful, and WAY too long. This is why Americans do not like JRPGs)

I bought it going in with thoughts of The Umbrella Chronicles and how great of an experience I had with that game. I thought Sweet, I can play through Resident Evil 2 and some of the games that the first one didn't cover. What I quickly learned was that while I did get to experience those Resident Evil games not covered in the first, this was not The Umbrella Chronicles.

The greatest problem I had with this game was the constantly shifting camera. It made it hard to line up shots when the camera was constantly bobbing back and forth slightly as if you were looking through the eyes of someone breathing heavy after a run. Now, I get this is suppose to add realism, but I also bought this because it was a rail shooter not Call of Duty. This urked me and my buddy, who played with me through The Umbrella Chronicles, to the point where he quit wanting to play it and I begrudgingly beat the stupid thing.

Now, let me say this: if you're not a true, diehard fan of the national pastime, if you don't get goosebumps at the conclusion of the of the Star Spangled Banner, if the thought of a dog and a beer and the pastoral pleasures of a 2-1 pitchers' duel don't appeal to you, then this game may be for you.
In short, if you're looking for a baseball game with all the trimmings of an arcade game on steroids, then you will enjoy this game.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a true baseball sim, then you'll want to stay away from this game.
There are no injuries.  There are very few extra base hits.  The pitcher/batter interface is simply remedial.  (You know *exactly* where the ball is going to be pitched before it's thrown; all you have to do is make sure your cursor is lined up right and gauge the speed.)  You don't have to warm up the relief pitchers.  It's impossible to strike out the CPU.  (To the other extreme, on All Star Baseball, I had 14 K's with Greg Maddux, who is NOT a strikeout pitcher.)  There are no walks.
In addition, there is no franchise mode.  Will we EVER see a game that combines great graphics, actual baseball simulation, great gameplay AND a franchise mode?
On the positive side, the graphics are terrific, and the controls are better than those on All Star Baseball.
Simply put, all that's missing is the keg.  Afterall playing this game is no better than playing in an industrial league softball tournament.

The tier one mode is pretty cool but is also far to simple in many ways.  The controls and graphics are top notch but the content is just to little.

The multi-player is a real disappointment.  No, not because I do not like it or because it is not fun.

There's some good software out there for it, but for the most part it's just not practical as a portable gaming machine. Sure the screen is gorgeous, although the pixels die quickly, but aside from messing with the firmware and playing a game here and there it just doesn't last as a game machine.

Pros:

- Great graphics (in most cases) on a very pretty screen...

- Lots of watered down UMD movies to select from if DVDs aren't your thing or you have money ot burn.

- A few really good games, particularly golf and puzzle games, and don't forget GTA.

- Hackable and crackable, run emulators of old games (Against the warranty!! Warning!)

Cons:

- Lots of bad software, and with third-party support slowly dropping due to poor hardware sales and high production costs the future is not looking so bright. There's no killer app yet, and most games are just stripped down or modified ports of PS2 games.

- The second ""P"" in PSP is a bit of an overstatement: The PSP is way too large and fragile for most situations, many games suffer from a lack of portability as a result of their design, very poor battery life, and WiFi support is obviously not very portable.

- Slow load speeds and disc access, noisy disc drive, and a very expensive storage medium.

- In seven months three pixels had died and turned permanently black.

- Cost of hardware and games, not just for consumers but for game developers.

Prophet

Chaos has erupted in Manhattan, New York, an infectious virus is eating the flesh of countless civilians -- this is all the information you, Alcatraz, and a team of fellow marines are given as you make your way up the Hudson River in a submarine vessel. When the ship is attacked by an unidentified enemy, you must escape the flooding death trap only to be mowed down by plasma-like gunfire at the surface. Aliens are in New York.

Alcatraz is a marine, a common grunt, and as he lays dying in the water he see's a man battling in futuristic armor -- ""Prophet"" as players of the previous of games may recognize. Prophet drags the dying marine out of the water and gives him a gift, the Nanosuit, before revealing that he has become infected and his time is up. The suit keeps Alcatraz alive, also making him a super weapon that may also hold the key to defeating the alien invasion, and so begins Crysis 2.

It's a wonderful premise, but it must be said now that Crysis 2's narrative lives up to none such potential.

Told entirely from the human perspective, the situation in Manhattan is complicated. The U.S. military is desperately attempting to evacuate civilians, while a private military company called CELL, seems to have it's own goals in what to do with you, the man at large in a nanosuit. Multiple problems occur with how this narrative carries along, largely because much of the game is simply traveling -- running through fortified zones of enemies to reach a scientist to speak with, or going to aid groups of soldiers. Everything about how the game progresses is simply direction after direction -- blow this up, hold this position, go through this tunnel. By the time you actually get to some plot development, it's when things really deteriorate.

The dialogue is horrendous. Whether it be the ramblings of your scientist friend, Gould, or the over-the-top outbursts of profanity laced anger from other characters, nothing sounds rational in Crysis 2. Each conversation ranges from humorous to annoying, from cliche to simply nonsensical. Even your nanosuit feels the need to repeat every minuscule direction you receive in a heavily computerized, droning voice.

And none of this would be so bad if the game wasn't trying so hard to be taken seriously. The plot is shallow, the twists and ending are both anti-climatic -- and the humanistic approach of how it feels to defend a city populated with  innocent lives comes across as awkward and out of place.

Tactical Options Available

The nanosuit can engage in a variety of functions that deplete suit energy:
cloaking makes you invisible to enemies, allowing you to avoid dangerous encounters, pick off enemies with silenced weapons, or sneak up for stealth kills. Activating armor gradual depletes suit energy as it gives you increased protection. And kicks, punches, and jumps can be charged to powerful effect for any reason you see fit.

The game helps you out in identifying options, seen through your visor, for each occupied zone you enter. Sniping from an elevated point, restocking or grabbing a new weapon from a nearby munitions dump, opportunities to stealth, and turrets or vehicles to utilize -- it's all up to you. Like it's predecessors, Crysis 2 touts these abilities heavily in how it effects typical FPS gameplay. Each encounter appears to be a playground of possibilities, but it quickly becomes clear how limited the nature of Crysis 2 is.

The primary issue is that for players who wish to be creative, there's not too many interesting approaches to take. You can stealth kill an entire encampment, or quite factually, cloak past most encounters in the game entirely. Your other choice is to engage in frantic firefights. There might be a vehicle in one zone or a turret there, but at the end of the day each encounter is very similar to the last. Enemies are challenging and can tear you down rather quickly if you don't balance the use of your suit energy, but they come in very little variety -- ranging from basic human soldiers, to more agile, melee heavy aliens, both being suspect to your usual tricks. Throw in some more armored foes that takes a few grenades to take down, and you have a very typical, if not generic, shooter.

Crysis 2 takes place in a city environment, notably less free than the jungle of it's immediate predecessor, Warhead. On top of this limitation, the suit itself if notably less impressive. Maximum speed is no longer an option, instead a light sprint key depletes energy instead -- which seems like a light jog compared to zipping around in the previous games. On top of that, your super strength now comes in chargeable bursts that leave you defenseless after draining all your energy, rendering it's usage impractical, especially on harder difficulties.

The feeling of power is stifled by cramped zones and a tired use of the same set ups. It all ends up being a very basic shooter, one that's routine and repetitive.

Pick and Choose

Once again the feature to customize weapon attachments at any time returns, allowing you to switch on silencers for your sniper rifles, different scopes for your assault rifles, laser aiming and more.  Along with this is a new feature that after collecting enough material off fallen aliens, allows you to spend it on suit upgrades. It offers some nifty utility, such as bullet tracing to help you locate incoming fire, but beyond an air stomp ability, all the upgrades are passive (such as improved cloaking or armor) and are hardly noticeable -- a missed opportunity to make the suit a bit more interesting.

What If...

Ever wonder how a battle between nanosuit soldiers would play out? Well that's exactly what the multiplayer in Crysis 2 is all about, and it's about as ridiculous as it sounds -- in a good way.

Crysis 2 adopts the very popular implementation of a rank system, offering gun upgrades and new abilities to players as they earn experience points. It admittedly feels a bit generic, but the nanosuit adds a little personality to the standard multiplayer layout.

The first thing on your mind is the first thing on everyone's mind -- cloaking. It's both effective and risky, giving you the jump on people but also making your shields extremely fragile. Other players can spot your blurred silhouette if they look carefully, or use the suit's nanovision to aid in the hunt. Activating armor when exchanging fire with others is a must, but also reduces mobility. Charging jumps leaves you access to elevated ledges, of which you can come crashing down from with a well placed air stomp.

It's definitely a more dynamic battlefield than most shooters, a bit frantic and with obvious balance issues, but there's good casual fun to be had with the game's standard set of multiplayer modes (king of the hill, deathmatch, capture the flag, etc...). It doesn't blow the roof off anything in multiplayer FPS, but it can have its moments.

The Obvious

Crysis 2 looks unbelievable. It's presentation makes for the most cinematic shooter ever made.

Cutscenes and interface are nearly all from the perspective of the suit bearer, and this makes for a very real sense of your surroundings. You will be tackled out of windows, shocking yourself with a defibrillator, and staring enemies in the face -- the first person flare is in full force.

The way lighting is handled is beautiful, andthe environments look stunning as a result. Foilage, water, city sky lines, and a great sense of scale makes Crysis 2 a game to show off.

What's more is the weapon design looks slick, and this helps the gunplay considerably in feel, also helped by satisfying sound effects and brilliant explosions.  The soundtrack is dramatic and well implemented, it's only a shame the game couldn't carry across the emotions it was trying to.

Conclusion

Crysis 2 falls flat, it abandons elements that have made it's formula more successful in the past -- namely a sense of power and freedom. Instead it's simplified down to routine encounters, and while with elements of choice, they are hardly entertaining. It's immersive approach and wonderful presentation can't carry a narrative with no substance, and though the multiplayer brings some fun tools to the table, it doesn't quite set itself apart from the norm.

Single-Player:

Narrative
A mature-rated tale, yet with childish dialogue and tedious approach to pacing. Plot developments lack excitement, characters are generic and non-sensible.

The Variety
The encounters are all too similar to remain interesting, especially with a limited feeling suit and lack of enemy variety.

Presentation
A testament to what can be achieved through a first person perspective, it looks and sounds great from start to finish.

Love it or Hate it: Well hey...
If you haven't played a Crysis game before, the implementation of the nanosuit may seem more novel this first time around, and in that sense there's certainly some fun to be had with the singleplayer. The issues still stand, but it could be easily worth playing through for some players.

The Experience -- 6.4

Multiplayer

Customization
Ranks, weapons, perks -- they are all there to be earned by every player. Nothing out of the ordinary that leads to impress, but typical customization is here.

Multiplayer Combat
A standard contemporary multiplayer with the twist of the nanosuit. Cloaking and other suit function add a noticeable dynamic to the battlefield, and maps, although few, offer a variety of approaches.

Love it or Hate it: Caution
Cloaked enemies can be about as frustrating to face against as it is fun to use yourself, and as a result the balance of this game may turn a good many away from taking it seriously.

2.0,False,"11 17, 2012",A1UQUDT2Q0YENM,B0056XXKIK,Michael,"I think of the hunting games as being casual gamer friendly. I consider an advanced gamer, so I was surprised by how tough this seems. It took me a couple tries to get through all the stages in the first level and I could not beat the second level without putting the game on easy! (couldn't get past it on normal after many tries!)

Hunting games don't really hold my interest, but I thought it would be a good game for the nieces and nephews. They enjoy many of the wii hunting games. But I know they would have less patience with this game than I do.

It's not that I can't shoot the deer, but the missions often require you to shoot say 5 bucks. Then sometimes you only see the 5 bucks you're supposed to shoot. You have 3 minutes to shoot 5 bucks. You miss the second buck because you were fending off a moose at first, you scrolled to the other side really fast, and your one shot at it missed. Then for the next two minutes, you're perfect but because you only saw 5 bucks in the 3 minutes you lose! And if this was the second stage of the level, you have to restart the whole level. I'm not sure if the aiming is poor or whether it's just too hard and exact. Either way, I should be able to get past the first world on easy! But even on easy, I fail once in a while and I still haven't beaten the first boss after many tries. And I'm giving up.

The graphics are ok, but seem in-between a ds game and 3ds game. The sound isn't bad, but there's nothing memorable. There is a lot of customization, and you can play with the stylus or analog stick. There are left handed options which is great! This is one of the few games that the 3d effect strains my eyes at full.

In the missions I played they all were the same type, you stay in one spot while looking around for things to shoot. Many of the wii games have you walk around between shooting animals and I miss that. There are different mission types that are very similar (shoot so many buck, shoot so many buck that are at a certain distance, tag so many doe). The mission type seems to be random because if you try a level multiple times, you'll get different mission types each time. Then the final insult to injury is that sometimes you get a mission where the goal is to not shoot more than three doe. It sounds nice to have an easy mission once in a while, but do you really want a mission where the goal is to not do anything for three minutes?

I love video games. I consider myself a hardcore video gamer who doesn't look down on the casual selections that I play with my family. But this isn't the casual game that a hardcore gamer hates. This is a dud. You may not find another 3ds hunting game, but there are tons of these games for the wii.

2.0,False,"11 16, 2011",A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B00432O50W,A. Griffiths,"I picked this game up because it looked like a creepy gory action style adventure a bit like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Sadly I was a bit disappointed. Although it looks good, it doesn't play very well and it tries way too hard to be cool.

The story tells of a guy called Garcia whose beautiful girlfriend has been abducted by demons from Hell, so he goes to Hell to get her back. That's it, that's the whole plot. I guess that's enough as this is really just a game where you kill lots of monsters and progress through levels, but a bit more depth would have been nice.

Anyway the game plays just like Devil May Cry - you start with a weapon and can enhance it or earn new weapons and upgrades by collecting energy dropped by monsters. You can also upgrade your own stats and buy items. The levels take the form of twisted visions of hell, and most f them are pretty grim, strung up corpses and body parts litter the screen as you progress through gothic city slums, foggy graveyards, farmsteads, mazes and cathedrals, and there's blood literally everywhere. Not a game for the squeamish. Anyway it's pretty much a case of kill everything and move on, but there are a few unique features, one of which is the aspect of Darkness. This is when waves of darkness cover the playing field (usually spewing from some boss or from a portal somewhere), and while it's covering the area, enemies can't be killed and your health gradually drains away. There are many points in the game where you have t keep de-activating the darkness, attacking monsters and then de-activate it again as monsters keep turning it back on. This is not as much fun as it might sound. Playing in the darkness is disorientating and difficult - but I guess that is the idea. Didn't make me enjoy it, though. Nearly every boss you meet will have some kind of darkness phase which you will have to interrupt to make progress in killing them, and this became quite predictable after a while.

The monsters that come after you range from the annoying but easy enemies that simply come in waves, to the annoyingly difficult. Some are hugely frustrating to kill, as they have specific attack patterns that you have to learn and dodge, and a few only have very few hidden weak spots - case in point, some are like spiky hedgehogs and they only reveal their weak spot (concealed on their belly) when they are stunned and fall flat on their backs for a second or two. You need to be an extremely good aim to kill these. Sadly I found the aiming really tricky! This is a 3rd person shooter mostly (Not sword swinging), so think Chris in Resident Evil 5, but a lot faster. Fun for those who like a challenge to the reflexes.

Anyway, now for my most severe criticism: this game tries so hard to be cool it just made me want to turn off. It is extremely vulgar, there is way too much talk about sex, bodily functions and general bad language. Things reach a low point when your gun (which has a character and a voice) gets an upgrade that makes it behave like ...an erection. The level involves a peep show and the gun only works when you let it become aroused via a dirty phone call. I found this puerile in the extreme, and it really left me not wanting to bother finishing the game. But if you love things crude and dirty, then roll up, but it didn't engage me in any way whatsoever.

There was some more ingenuity - a couple of levels were 2D side-scrolling cartoons! Very odd (and not all that simple). In general the whole game is pretty surreal, it's all based in Hell so anything can happen at anytime - actually that kind of worked against it, as after a while you're just saying: ""yeah yeah, what are you gonna do to me next?"".

So to wrap up, I didn't find the game much fun. Aiming at monsters was very tricky - and that's almost 90% of the fighting style. Levels became predictable - oh look more heads on spikes - and the sexual and toilet-based humour should have been left out. So for me, this was a bit of a miss rather than a hit.",Left me wanting more depth,1321401600,3,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Frustrating game for alt-aholics like me. Housing is instanced but a limited number of total lots (unless they changed it since I played last), so if you aren't filthy rich, you will probably never own a house. Also, by default you are forced to play dungeons with strangers and queue as your class's role unless you have 3 friends to go with you (then you can all play whatever class you fancy so long as you go to the dungeon together). The mount requires doing dungeons, so if you're shy like me or nervous about not playing your class right / getting yelled at for not knowing a dungeon or boss mechanics / being blacklisted by the majority-awful fanbase, no free mount for you. And you'll miss a lot of plot too if I remember right, if you skip dungeons... dunno, haven't wanted to play in ages.

the graphics are ok.  they're not at the level of Halo, Splinter Cell, or Orta (or Ghost Recon, or Tides of War, or... ok, most x-box games).  i would say that this game looked pretty good if it was on the PS2 (which isn't really saying much).  the environments are kinda bland and the particle effects (gun fire, explosions, items shattering, etc.) are barely there.  the only time i thought the game looked good was using the rifle zoom and during the intro to each level.  the character movement is smooth, but they look like knuckleheads and the enemies are just goofy. you've seen better, much better.
the gameplay is about as straightforward as it gets.  it's a third-person shooter so the rules are simple = if it moves, shoot it.  the path before you is totally linear, which means you'll be running along from point A to point B to point C without being able to deviate and explore the environment (which looks weak, so i guess that's not so bad).  you have objectives to complete, but those are to either to reach a checkpoint or blow something up.  sound familiar?

all four characters have special abilities, but they only use them when you're in control of the character.  so, if you're playing as the guy who gets extra adrenaline to kick some tail (which is the lizard-looking creature), the character that can cloak herself to sneak around is getting shot up because you have to switch to her to use the invisibility cloak.... and when you switch, the lizard guy will stop using his boosted strength to kill because you switched characters.  in other words, the special abilities are ok when you're facing only a few enemies, but when attacked by many, they become useless.  this became one of my biggest issues with the game because the special abilities could have been much more useful.
another thing that drove me nuts was that the position of the character on the screen (the one you're controlling) is all wrong.  if you're shooting at someone above or below you, the camera angle is ok.... but if the enemy is straight ahead?  you character's body gets in the way and you can't see what's coming.  sometimes you have to run to the left or right just to see what's in front of you = poor game design.
the rest of the game is about as mediocre as what's already been mentioned.  the weapons fire and voice acting are ok.  the weapons offered are nothing new (the rifle zoom and targeting reticule are taken directly from Halo).  nothing about this game is really inspiring and i found myself wanting to sell it about half way through as nothing new was coming along.

as far as the space fighting, the graphics are great, but the gameplay was TERRIBLE.  i couldn't figure out how to find the enemies in the vastness of space, how to shoot them or anything.  i think this kind of thing should be somewhat intuitive.  i don't play flight sims or anything, but i can easily figure out how to fly a plane... if you make it intuitive.

on the plus side, the single player is good so far.  i'm curious as to whether battlefront 1 is a better multiplayer game than this, but i'm not sure i want to spend the money to find out.","great potential, but disappointed so far",1151280000,4,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

I used to love COD ""back in the day,"" but with each recent version I can't seem to enjoy it much. The Exo movements are very cool and I was glad to see the series try something new, I had hoped this would be enough to keep my interest. But the Exo suits were not enough to keep me playing, even though I did enjoy bouncing around the maps, the movements are nice but everyone is STILL camping in corners.

Oddly enough, I found the killstreaks to be one of the most boring areas of the gameplay; I ended up turning most of them off to use my points elsewhere. The gunplay was pretty standard fare for COD, some neat new weapons (lasers, grenades launchers, etc), but you die in a heartbeat as always and you'll find whatever works the fastest might be best for you. Most worrisome was the lack of dedicate servers; I guess since Sony didn't have any they opted out for Xbox Live as well. WHO STILL USES P2P HOSTING IN 2015! COD is one of the biggest franchises in the world, and I am still playing without servers. Not to praise Battlefield but at least they have servers, who at Activision thought peer to peer hosting was a good idea?

The game's visuals are not bad at all, most things look decently crisp but you can tell some things were held back a bit in transition from last gen to this gen. The art style is nice, a heavy future military style pervades the game, and yet I find myself thinking they could have done a bit more with the levels and art style to have created something really interesting.

2.0,False,"12 8, 2004",A1RFYCSNNOJ0VW,B0000E2OBD,A. Alkins,"If you've read all the reviews here at Amazon on this game, you're probably pretty confused. Some people claim it's the greatest MMORPG ever. Others say it's the most boring and time consuming they've played. If you're looking to buy this game, it's hard to make that decision based on the conflicting information. I doubt my review will help as it's based on my experience only. This is exactly the nature of this game, you either love it or hate it.

Unfortunately for me, this game did not live up to my expectations. However, I'd like to start on the positives. Firstly, the game's graphics are pretty good. There are three main base cities to start off in (there are other cities that you can explore to, but your ranks and missions are generally based on the three base cities). The environment changes dramatically in the different zones, it's refreshing to just take some time and explore the different scenery in the game.

This game is also huge. I've played it for a couple of months and I doubt I've seen more than 50% of the world. Add to that, the recent expansion makes the game even more mammoth. This also has a negative, I'll address it later. FFXI features all you'd expect in a MMORPG. You have your different skills, you can multi-skill when you reach a specific level. You also have ""crafts"" which are side skills that you can do, e.g. fishing, farming, etc. The depth in this game is mind boggling. The number of side skills (I believe there are eight or nine) all have their own levels.

Currency is also traded with something called gil. You need gil to get anywhere in this game. FFXI is heavily cooperation inclined. You cannot play this game solo and reach anywhere. Anyone who says this would either be lying or have absolutely nothing else to do in their life. This is both a positive and a negative. The positive being it encourages players to group together, share knowledge and play together. The negatives being there's always competition to find the best groups. People also tend to clique together and play separately from the whole community.

I should note that FFXI is played amongst several servers. When you create your character, you are randomly placed on a server. You cannot move from one server to the other, this is your server for life. If you want to play on the same server as your friends, you must buy (with gil, not real money) something called a ""Worlpass"" which your friend can enter when they're creating their account. I have no problem with this system, I understand it's necessary for the maintenance of the popularity of this game.

In the game, there's a wide range of armor and weapons that can be bought or retrieved. In your character's class, there are tons of spells and skills to be learned at periodic levels. The battle system is similar to most FF games however the speed of the battles greatly depends on your equipment. I like the battle system, personally I find it very flowing.

On to the negatives, and there are many. As I mentioned earlier, the game is huge. This brings me to my greatest grievance with FFXI. It takes far too long to reach anywhere without the help of higher level spells or items (Airship). I'm sure the drop out rate with this game is high for new players. You can spend fifteen to twenty five minutes walking from one area to the other. I personally found myself spending more time walking than fighting. That's what drove me to stop playing.

Another big negative is the variety of mobs. There's a very limited number of mob classes available. Most zones are limited to only three or four different mob classes of varying strength. This makes fighting extremely repetitive, you are fighting the same looking thing each time. Every city has ""[insert name] crab"", ""[insert name] worm"", ""[insert name] fly"" that ALL look the same. The developers really failed in providing variety to players, especially since this game requires hundreds of hours to achieve mighty levels. A related negative would be the fact you have to consider every mob as you have no idea of the mob's strength if they look alike, even in the same room.

Big negative number three relates to people selling gil for real money. Yes, it plagues all MMORPGs, however most companies try to do something to clamp down on it. Square has done absolutely nothing to try to control the sale of gil for money. What this has caused is the cost (in gil) of items to be sky high to due the easy availability of gil to those who are willing to spend money for it. This makes the game extremely difficult for the average player who simply gains gil from killing, quests and trading items. FFXI is centered around trading items with other players (there's a central auction house for this) that you can't get around playing without buying your equipment. I'm not sure if it's related to the gil selling, however all the rare item drops are ""camped"" by dozens of people. The average player will never be able to achieve a valuable item without buying it.

Finally, because you can't solo in this game, you need to find yourself some friends to play with. If you can't join a group (called linkshells), you will be spending minutes or hours waiting to join parties. The number of hours required to reach anywhere in this game is ridiculous. That's probably why so many people are either terribly addicted to this game or absolutely frustrated. Unfortunately for me, FFXI wasn't for me. It's too demanding on time and far too repetitive for me. There are some people this game appeals to, I'm certainly not one of them.

2.0,False,"09 29, 2006",A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0009R1SZA,Michael J. Tresca,"Gauntlet took the traditional dungeon crawl style made popular by the pen-and-paper role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons, and amped it up to an insane degree by tossing billions of monsters at four heroes from a top-down perspective.  Your heroes, in turn, were armed with medieval weaponry that they hurled at ridiculous speeds, machinegun-style.

I've been a fan of Gauntlet since the game was in the video arcades.  Ah, the good old days of the Barbarian, Valkyrie, Elf, and Wizard. Of course, no self-respecting guy wanted to be the Valkyrie, because...well because she was a girl.  The Elf was nearly just as bad, especially when he shrieked in his prissy elf voice, ""Oh no!"" as he neared death.

Gauntlet introduced a lot of fantasy troupes that are routinely mocked today.  It rationalized that when you eat food, you heal.  Given that I'd prefer just sucking down a shake once a day to actually having to eat, I have difficulty imagining that food actually gives you that kind of recuperative abilities. Sometimes food was just sitting in some chest, waiting to be discovered.  Other times monsters dropped it.  It always looked delicious; a whole chicken on a plate with potatoes, a leg of pork, or some smelly cheese.  It never made any sense and didn't have to.

Gauntlet was also known for the Dungeon Master (again, swiped from D&D) providing some obvious and not so-obvious commentary.  My all time favorite is when the other characters accidentally destroyed food.  ""ELF SHOT THE FOOD!"" booms the DM, encouraging every other player to smack them upside the head. About to die?  The DM had some advice there too. ""WIZARD NEEDS FOOD.  BADLY!""  When I get really hungry before lunch, sometimes I hear that voice too.

Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows, attempts to update the hack-and-slash style of the original Gauntlet while at the same time providing the rationale for the characters' ridiculous ""kill `em all, let the DM sort `em out"" style of mass murder.

Our heroes are immortals, crucified (!) by some kind of Aztec-looking sun emperor.  His seven advisors all turned out to be wretchedly evil.  Since the heroes are immortal, they didn't die (and now we know why they keep coming back to life each game...it all makes sense now!).  Filled with regret, the emperor (taking the role of the booming DM voice guy) guides our heroes along the path to redemption by encouraging them to kicking the living snot out of his former employees.

A lot of thought went into Seven Sorrows.  The generators that spawn dozens of monsters are still there, but they create enemies with a magical flourish. The environment is beautifully rendered in three dimensions, allowing enemies to be knocked right off precipices (my favorite tactic). In addition to all the running and the killing, there are occasional quests where our heroes go and kill more monsters, find a key, then run back to the door and open it.  Gauntlet was never a deep game.

Each hero has been updated with a wide variety of moves, including magical powers that replace the potion-bombs from the original Gauntlet.  The Elf can stun enemies, the Valkyrie shrieks and tosses bad guys into the air, etc.  Each hero has a logical ranged weapon too; the Valkyrie shoots energy lances from her blade, the Elf pulls out his bow and fires, the Barbarian hurls hand axes and the Wizard shoots bolts of energy.  All four heroes are highly individualized; the Valkyrie's ""jump back"" maneuver is actually a series of backflips while the Wizard teleports all over.  Overall, the graphics are impressive.

Unfortunately, Seven Sorrows is far, far too short.  My wife and I have come to the conclusion that we are now advanced players, so starting a game on normal difficulty no longer suffices.  We should have set it on hard but didn't; in retrospect, I'm not sure if that would have helped.  We ended up beating the game in the span of just a few hours.

It's ironic that Seven Sorrows is probably most like the original Gauntlet game.  That's not a compliment though; in a crowded market of Gauntlet-clones, Seven Sorrows doesn't sufficiently distinguish itself from all the other sword-swinging, axe-hurling, bow-shooting, magic-blasting games out there.","GAUNTLET NEEDS FOOD, BADLY!",1159488000,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

When people initially play this game, they will likely be awestruck by its beautiful hand-drawn artwork, its traditional RPG mechanics, incredible humor, and fascinating story; but then it seems the further you get in the game, the more the game frustrates you.

Contrary to others have said in the more ""negative"" of the reviews here, I do not think the armor system is that broken. I think the leveling system is broken. Leveling seems to have no affect on your character whatsoever, while armor and weapons make a much bigger influence. Unfortunately, most of the gear and accessories- especially in chapters 3 and 4- require an unreasonable amount of money to purchase, forcing players to grind to no-end. And without the armor upgrades, a normal equal-level mob can take 50% of your health away with one hit (assuming they don't crit, because then they can attack again up to 3x, basically killing you).

Another big problem with this game is its dungeon design. The first few chapters had a great set-up, they were simple but not too simple. In the later parts of the game, the dungeons all become these giant mazes where every single new room and floor looks exactly like the previous. To make matters worse, while trying to traverse through these labyrinths, you still have to solve puzzles on top of it and look for treasures. The worst feeling is when you finally find the exit, but then questions yourself whether or not you found all of the great items in the dungeon (especially considering how expensive gear is, as previously mentioned), making you save and turn back around into the maze, praying that you can find your way back to the exit again.

The skill system is also broken. In order to upgrade your skill from level 1 to 5, you need a series of medallions (bronze, silver, gold, platinum). If you have 100 silvers, 100 gold, and 100 platinum but no bronze, then your skill will never get higher than level 1. Unfortunately, bronze medallions are extremely difficult to acquire and once you get to the mid-point of the game, you can't go back to try to grind up some.  In total, you have over 100 different skills and I only acquired 10 medallions throughout the entire game, most I used prematurely since I just assumed you'll be given the opportunity to get more later. I assumed wrong.

The last big issue I have with this game is the final dungeon, boss, and ending. I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say it sucked. It's short and lacks the needed substance to give you that closure and reward for all the hard work you put into game. [Minor spoilers]: The final set of boss fights are just as awful. For one, characters that you've been leveling this entire game will be suddenly omitted from those fights. One character in particular, receives his final weapon just a few floors from the bosses and then he's ejected from the final two fights completely. What's the point, then? Also, you're only allowed to use 3 instead of the usual 4 characters for these fights, and all three characters are characters you don't get to choose. One of the forced characters in particular is just awful too.  Lastly, the final boss doesn't matter...literally. If you beat him, you get the ending. If you wipeout, you get the same ending. There was no point in even fighting him.

All-in-all, this game had so much potential and I really did love it initially, but then as it progressed, it just got worse and worse to the point where it actually kind of makes you angry. I recommend this game only if you can get it for a good deal <$20, anything higher and you'll feel like you've just been ripped off.",The opposite of fine wine,1311379200,12,,

The graphics are worse than the origanal halo game. The people only move their mouthed up and down to talk. They only have one way of walking to.

The voicing is terrible. The worst ive ever heard. This Brasilian girl sounds like a Chinese girl. I cant even understand her half the time. She was always saying watch out for ""green eggs"" and I was like ""what?"". It took me about a half our to realise she meant grenades. She is terrible animated and she sits in a room that has a single large box in it and that's it. Then they try to add some sex appeal to her by giving her a exposing shirt. No thanks, I would rather do Ms pacman.

Its bad enough that the voices are bad. The dialogue is worse. Here are some examples:

Paladin: we cant stay and help these people.
Shadow: I think we should stay and help them.
Paladin: you're right

Paladins Journal: we are moving on to a small coffee plantation. I don't have any water. I hope we find the pilot

There are countless other instances that just make me to angry to write. Also, all of the Brazilians somehow know English.

The story is boring. The only real main story line is Palidin trying to get to Vegas for Christmas.

The guns are terrible. The are completely inaccurate.

Another big problems are that there are missions that recommend you sneak around which is impossible because the guards always manage to see you. Its like the developers didn't put any effort into adding human qualities. The guards can be facing the other way but turn around immediately once you get within like 300 yds of them.

Now for the good and ok features:

The RTS is an interesting feature but it could use some work.there is no way to control both squad at once and have them do the same thing.

It is cool how each person has unique skills.

The game starts out with you, John Conner, learning how to maneuver over an obstacle such as a wall. You're in Los Angeles, California, and things look about the same in 2016. You take your battle across the street to fight aero units. They fly, shoot at you, and make easy targets with the shotgun that you'll find soon after. I'd explain the story but I guess we could just sum it up into man versus machine.

The game sort of goes downhill from here. While the first level isn't that bad, the game just progresses in a spiral downward until you don't want to play anymore. The best bit of the game is actually all in the first level and where you get to control a giant mech. You hardly run into any cool terminator machines though. You will battle 60% of the time these stupid aero units. Again: they fly, shoot, and explode. Other than that, the T-600s (skeleton-looking machines that carry mini-guns) and T-7-Ts are the only things you fight. Sure, maybe two other enemies appear in the game, but that's still lackluster. Let's not even mention the boring vehicle missions.

The controls aren't horrible, but the game overall feels very generic. It plays much like a Gears of War-clone, but just not near as good. In fact, most of the time either your team mates are going to get all the kills, or you're going to see the load screen more times than you need. If anything, I'd say that the actual gameplay is decent enough to save this game from being a total disaster. It plays the way it should. It just feels they didn't touch up on the overall handling of the game, and then ruined it by not going anywhere in regards of enemy units or an epic boss battle.

I never tried the game in co-op. I never got the chance. No one wanted to play with me, and I don't blame them. The game is just not fun. If anything, it works, and doesn't crash, so I guess that's a good sign. Right?

The Good

The graphics. That's about it. And even then there are plenty of problems. For starters you hardly have any control over any options. Want to turn off shadows (notorious frame rate killers), not possible. I have a pretty high-end rig and I encounter lousy frame rates, and tons of stuttering with the audio dialog. Only by turning down the visual features can I get acceptable performance, but then the stunning graphics are no more.

The Bad

Unfortunately for Pandemic, this would encompass the rest of the entire game. Enemy AI is lousy at a distance, and entirely scripted. Restart a level, and they'll be in the same places every time, so forget about replay value.

If FSW is an accurate representation of the Army's capabilities, then we are in real trouble. While the soldiers move and take up basic firing position correctly, their reactions are terrible. When directed to take cover, they'll frequently use some of the worst cover around. Their shooting accuracy is terrible, often spending more time shooting everything around a target rather than the target itself.

FSW is clearly built for a console and not a PC. Load times are terrible, save points (Doesn't every developer by now know that this is a terrible way to treat PC users), limited configuration options, and a gamepad-esq interface.

Don't think for a second the manual will prove useful. The instructions are vague, with poor text descriptions to define actions, with no supporting graphics.

While Pandemic attempted to reflect reality in the game through degrading cover, tactical movements, and liberal use of swearing (Great way to represent out soldiers, they swear more than a trucker in a shouting match with a longshoreman), FSW just falls flat on itself as a tactical shooter.

2.0,False,"10 21, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000TA52GI,Lisa Shea,"Based on the anime and manga series by Tite Kubo, ""Bleach: Shattered Blade"" has all the parts in place for a good fighting game. However, the game defies all expectations in how poorly it is executed.

The only thing relevant to the game that you need to know about Bleach is that there are ghost samurai called ""Soul Reapers"" who have unique swords with different powers. Sounds like a great basis for a fighting game, right? Well, ""Shattered Blade"" seems to somehow mess up the simple fighting game formula with a poor concept and poorer handling. The game is a ""3d"" fighting game - the two fighters can circle around each other to dodge attacks. Attacks are divided into three varieties - slash (horizontal slash), chop (vertical slash), and stab (forward attack). These are done by moving the Wii remote in the appropriate manner to imitate such an attack. The attack types work on a rock-paper-scissors hierarchy: chop beats slash, slash beats stab, and stab beats chop. So, basically, if you interrupt a chop attack with a stab attack, the stab attack will go through. There's also a little minigame that can occur if two swords clash where both fighters go through five rounds of ""rock paper scissors"" with each other. The more rounds you win, the more damage you'll do once it's over.

There are three kinds of attacks. Regular attacks are done by simply waving the Wii remote with no buttons pressed - these are very fast but do little damage, and their purpose is to weather down an enemy for a critical attack. Critical attacks are stronger, slower melee attacks that are done by combining a Wii remote movement with holding down the A button. Critical attacks change depending on the character, but are not particularly personalized. Special Attacks are the final type of attack, and are done by holding B while moving the Wii remote. These tend to be more personalized based on the character - projectile attacks and special abilities fall within this category.

Each character also has a powered-up mode, achieved by charging (shaking the Wii nunchuck) or by taking damage, both of which fill a gauge. Once the gauge is full, the character enters their higher-level state. This involves a cutscene that lasts about 5 to 7 seconds and cannot be skipped; in a 60-second battle, this is kind of an annoyance. Some characters simply get stronger with their powered-up state, while others change more drastically in their attack patterns. For example, Kenpachi Zaraki simply strengthens his attacks, while Toshiro Hitsugaya summons a giant ice creature to augment his techniques, and Renji Abarai turns his sword into a giant segmented snake that attacks his enemies.

The variety of characters in the game is probably its strongest point, though this is due more to the series it was based on rather than the game itself. Each character has unique abilities; there are plenty of regular sword-swinging characters, but some also have unique twists like extending weapons, a bow (can only use ranged attacks), and one character whose blade heals his enemies, so he's forced to use his special attacks only (which don't use the sword) until he reaches his powered-up form, at which point he does massive amounts of damage (until it expires). The special attacks and powered-up forms are the primary things that separate the characters, though the fact that each character only has one or two special abilities at most in the series somewhat limits how unique they can be. There are 28 characters in the game (over half need to be unlocked by playing through story modes), each with their own fairly unique playing style.

There are some extras included in the game, as well, though the selection is rather poor. You can buy character models and set them as the main menu guide (who just stands in the background and lists off the main menu choices as you select them), or you can buy new costumes for your characters. However, there aren't any real NEW costumes created for the game - rather, they're just costumes that were in the series for short periods of time, like the school uniforms that some of the characters wore when visiting the ""real world"".

The problem with the game, control-wise, is just how poorly the whole ""rock paper scissors"" thing works. Regular attacks do next to no damage, so basically you're just trying to set up for a critical or special attack, which vary wildly depending on the characters. Characters with longer reaches, and particularly characters with extending weapons (Renji Abarai and Ikkaku Madarame) have huge, unbalanced advantages - they can swing their weapons with huge ranges with next-to-no penalty for doing so. The game is basically a button-masher in its purest form, except instead of mashing buttons you're waving a Wii remote hoping that whatever you're doing is the right type of attack to counter the enemy's. Just because of how random everything feels, the game is incredibly unfun and frustrating to play.

The graphics in this game aren't great. It's obvious they tried to go for an anime style, with lots of japanese sound effects and speed lines, but overall the game looks like it belongs on a PS2 or Gamecube rather than a current generation console. Plus, with the speed of movement in-game, it's hard to even see the effects, anyways. One particular annoyance is that, in story mode, there are cutscenes at the beginning and end. However, these ""cutscenes"" are actually just a single still image with character voiceovers. The sound isn't great, either. The music is lackluster and forgettable, and the voice acting doesn't sync up particularly well. I have no problem with the English dub, but the way it's been put together with the visuals is pretty poor. It feels really awkward and clunky.

It's difficult to convey how little fun Shattered Blade is to play. Even for a fan of the series, it's a complete exercise in frustration. The controls are so wonky (especially the movement controls, which allow you to go forwards and backwards or side to side, but not both at the same time, meaning you have to run in a zig-zag pattern and avoid the invisible walls around the arena) that the entire game is just completely unenjoyable.

After playing this game for a while now, I want to update my review..........This game is fun OK play, but they ruined the game play with way to much debris being thrown into the track, and then the game will crash you, no matter what you do with the controls.

Picked up the controller and within three weeks the right bumper no longer registers. Not a big deal, this stuff happens. I return it and get a replacement from amazon. New controller shows up and within two weeks both bumpers on the new controller no longer register presses. I then realize I can use the small triggers next to the normal triggers instead of the bumpers. I start using these triggers instead of the now broken bumpers (should have just returned it again. )

Fast forward to today, the controller now just does what it wants. Randomly registers bumper presses all on its own.

And the second thing?  It's gameplay is more ""arcade style"" making it easier for button-mashers who can't make the cut on ESPN NFL 2K5.

My proof?  Simple, I played ESPN 2K5 for a few weeks and then switched back to Madden and beat it like it owed me money. I faked every punt and threw touchdowns with my kicker as QB!  After four games of crappy plays that couldn't miss I traded it in.  Try it.  NFL Street is more real.

This means more arcade style goofiness in their sports games for FIVE YEARS.

But man, this is just boring.

There are no tactics or skills required to play this game whatsoever, you just mash buttons at hordes of enemies, level up and get better gear. As a single player game, it gets incredibly boring fast. Playing with others makes it a little more fun, but not much. There's so many better options these days, I really just don't get it.

Honestly the only reason people get hooked on this game, is the same reason people get hooked on web games like Farmville. There's just this compulsion to keep playing to acquire more and more virtual items. That's how Blizzard defines difficulty as well. In most RPGs, higher difficulty means enemies are harder to kill, you're easier to kill, and everything else remains the same. Meaning you have to adjust your tactics, prepare for big battles ahead of time, and plan your character progression more carefully with a focus on min/maxing. In this game, the multiple difficulty settings are just a way to compensate for the increased power you get with gear.

D2 practically created the RPG concept of ""endgame"". Where you hit max level, and then just grind for gear. WoW incorporated this idea as well with their raiding system. I just don't get the appeal of it, why would you want to rush through so much content to just do the same thing over and over to obtain a few virtual items? Well, there are millions who like this sort of thing, so maybe I'm the weird one.

Anyways, aside from it's rather uninspired gameplay, the graphics are dated, definitely not PS4 worthy, the story is absurd, and it's just plain boring to play.

Plot: The plot is extremely mediocre.  Skip this if you don't want spoilers  It seems like the characters were randomly generated.  Some of them are rather annoying, and some of them are good, but none of them are all that memorable like past FF characters.  The entire plot revolves around a bunch of people who were unfortunate victims of circumstance trying to stop an old guy from destroying the world.  So the group of people run around trying to solve a quest that they have no idea what it is so that they turn into a crystal instead of into a zombie.

And yet, Cabela's has put out so many of these games, it is obvious that someone is buying them. Honestly, I strain to find ANY pros for this game, so the best I could come up with is:

Pros:
- The trophies are really, really easy. Trophy [...], come one, come all!

Cons:
- the graphics are mediocre. For a game with as little going on as this one, you would think that the graphics would be better. But you are treated to bland character designs, lazy landscapes. I guess the animals are kind of nice. Sort of.
- the sixaxis controls, as usual, suck. Here's the thing, PS3 - you're not the Wii. Stop pretending you are. Your sixaxis motion control is a joke. And the silliness of making ridiculous motions on your controller in order to make a good duck call is downright laughable. Leave the motion controls with the company that got it right, and be content in the knowledge that you still have the best handheld controller in the business.
- The gameplay will literally have you laughing out loud. During one hunt, I had to find scent markers. Of course, smell-o-vision has not yet been invented. The solution? You can actually see clouds of scent appearing on the screen. Talk about simulating the hunting experience. Other laughable encounters have you catching multiple fish in minutes, or shooting 10 ducks in two minutes, etc. etc. It's a monumental joke.
- The controls are frustrating. I have to hit the L2 button to aim, followed by...the L1 button to stabilize? Give me a break. One of the worst offenders is walking, where a simple pebble can obscure your path.
- The guide. This game might have improved immensely if I could have riddled my guide's body with 100 bulletholes, while trying to evade the warden and his evil deputies through the wildernesses of Alaska. Instead, I am treated to a guide who has an annoying voice, and the patience of a one-year old (worst offender: in the first mission, after shooting 10 pheasants, the guide calls for me to come to him. However, due to the slow pace of my walk, he actually called me 5 more times as i was in transit!).

Along the way Guild 2 offers lots of distractions like going to a tavern, going to church, running for a town office, courting a mate, and having kids. It's a neat idea, but the gameplay was poorly designed.

What went wrong? I think the most unsatisfying thing about Guild 2 is it is dynasty simulation where you direct the lives of a family from generation to generation, but you can only control three family members at one time. The family members that you don't control basically don't advance until you take control of them. To top things off, once you control a family member as one of the three, if you remove them from your control to add someone else you can never control them again. Yes, your kids can go to school and go to an apprenticeship (further advancement allowed for scholars), but once they do this they make no further advancement until you take control of them. You can't even hire them into one of your businesses to gain experience. You even needed to have multiple businesses left at lower levels of advancement to allow a new dynasty member to gain experience so he could control the more advanced buildings. If you haven't played the game, this might not make a lot of sense, but basically this was very annoying due to this limitation.

As you play the game you will also notice a lot of unrealistic issues. The most apparent is that each day (turn) in the game represents 4 years of game time. There is daytime and nighttime in this turn (4 year period), yet each turn also is a change in season. I understand they want to have the daily life merged with career and family, but the result is just plain stupid. Again they tried to do too much and degraded the value of the experience.  I also noticed the abundance of women in politics which is abnormal for the medieval period. Maybe one member on council, but not all of them.

Another disappointment was the trading part of the economic simulation. The game forced you to move goods to the marketplace even in the same city as the business was in. You could also put things for sale in your storefront, but you would only be paid a preset ""base"" amount. There is auto features in the game for managing businesses, but they were very limited. While it does not have the depth of options for businesses as Guild 2 does,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patrician-3/dp/B0000DBK2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patrician 3</a>&nbsp;handled the economic system much more simply and enjoyable.

There is some combat in Guild 2, but it makes you wish there wasn't. You don't really control anything in combat except maybe causing it and once you're in there is no getting out. Basically, the game keeps going until one side is beaten. No withdrawing allowed. No surrendering. Henchmen die, hit the ground, and fade away. Named characters are knocked unconscious (you can finish them off if you so desire). Basically, it's more of a nuisance and an irritation rather than a feature.

A couple more gameplay issues that I didn't like, courting and favor with other characters. Courting is really not that fun. Basically, you just select several options to make them fall in love with you like compliment, kiss, embrace, dance, take a bath, etc. You can only select activities so frequently, so this requires telling the partner to follow you until the options are available again. Again it's more of a nuisance which distracts you from running your business and courting needs to be done quickly sense every day is 4 years. The attitude of other characters is controlled by favor. The system for improving favor is stupid and more of a nuisance. Read poems, give gifts, give compliments and other courting actions.

There are a lot of cool things about the game like the numerous upgrades available for individual businesses and the variety of types of businesses, but the good is definitely overwhelmed by the bad.

There are expansions to this game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guild-2-Pirates-Of-The-Seas/dp/B000QGIXDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guild 2 - Pirates Of The Seas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guild-2-Venice/dp/B001CSCX5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guild 2: Venice</a>.

Keep in mind, I'm generally really nice with my reviews.

I've never been an assassins creed fan before. I've heard of the games, but the idea of it didn't really fascinate me. when I heard that the new one was going to have pirate theme though..That's when I got interested! I'm a sucker for pirate stories and the whole concept of it.

It runs smooth on the wii U. The water is rendered nicely. I've never seen water look so realistic in any video game!  So I'll give a star for that. The world is very colorful and beautiful also.

Buuuut Some of the missions (since this is my first assassins creed game) took me a couple of tries to beat.. Wait, more like hundreds.... cause the instructions were slightly ...unclear?.. I don't know, maybe I'm just dumb but it felt too overwhelming  and confusing at times. I found myself saying ""WHAT THE__ AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?"" Waaay too many times in this game. I thought I might just need to get used to it... Wrong. It's just too clunky. And the whole animus thing was so ... Just... What? I thought it was really.. Dumb, and annoying. it felt like an interruption from an already bland experience.

The story bored me so much to the point where I just muted the game and played music. It became a chore to play. I didn't care about what was going on.

The ONLY FUN I had in this game was taking over forts and picking up the dead bodies and throwing them off the side of the cliff. That's it. It was funny watching them hit things on their way down. But I realized 50.00$ is too much money just to watch something that temporarily entertaining.

For those who like the Angry Birds franchise, it's very similar, but with 3D game play.  After playing it for a while, there are a few major design flaws that make the game less enjoyable.  The primary concern is the 'freezing' of the cursor on-screen.  After throwing an object at a target the game takes a moment to catch up to your movements, resulting in a frozen cursor.  By the time it catches up, you're already shaking your hand around and wondering what's wrong with the thing.  For the slower paced rounds, this is a non-issue.  For the games where you have to throw the objects on target and quickly, it becomes nearly impossible to complete a level with a satisfactory score.

Unlike many other people I have seen, I thought NCAA '06 was one of the best games for EA Sports in a long time (first time NCAA was better than Madden).  A few things need improvement but I thought the flow of the game and interface was great.  It was fun to play and realistic at the same time.  EA Sports totally revamped the game, but for the worse.  If you try to play Dynasty mode, it takes hours to get to the first game.  Although EA attempted to make the recruiting more realistic, it takes forever to select players. It is also very difficult to navigate through the screens.  Then when you try to set your depth chart you typically want to start your best players, but the order of the subs is not by rating as in the past.  It takes forever to make substitutions.  You no longer can quickly rotate through positions and players.  You now have to use your R2 which pops up a menu to select position and then select the position, but it takes a few seconds for the players to load in that position.  Although this may appear minor, it took me over 45 minutes just to scroll through my players and select the best players to play.  Overall game play is not as user friendly as previously and the interface is confusing.  Not sure why EA Sports felt they had to revamp a great game, but I hope Madden is not this bad.

Much like the PS3, this game is disappointing.  I do not recommend this one at all or at least rent it first.

I have been purchasing NCAA and Madden since the first titles.  I really hope that EA makes a turn around.  I cannot believe that any gamer who tests this game for EA would actually like it.

Right now zombies are spawning within solid objects.  They can not be interacted with so infestations can not be cleared.
Also mission persons are not where they are suppose to be to further the missions.  They talk but are not there and can not be interacted with.  This again makes the game UNPLAYABLE.

Game seems to be flaky in just about every way.  Can't rely on much of anything to work all the time and if it does it does so in a flaky way.

Also all characters seem to run into invisible walls all over the place.  The currently driven car not on the radar issue is still in effect.  Real easy to loose your vehicle at night.  I would characterize the game as totally unpolished.  Many times your companion will just stand there while you are getting killed.

It wallowed shamelessly on its grinding, its overblown violence and explosive pryotechnics. But whats come down the tube wrapped in the same packaging with a #2 on it is so... ordinary.

Graphics are original Crackdown, with some additional cel shading on your player character, literally. 3 year old graphics, coming out of a develop that should still be sitting on a pile of gold from the initial games success. I've seen Oblivion mods that put more effort into improving backgrounds and other graphical elements.

Gameplay is the formula you love. Jump, hit, and shoot like a superhero. The only problem is they've apparently decided that the only thing missing was areas that could be turned into a crater with a single stray shot. You have to spend five minutes clearing explosive barrels so that you aren't sent pinwheeling into the sky after 45 barrels all explode simultaneously. And while you're flying through the air, twenty enemies with semi-auto rocket launchers and pinpoint accurate grenade launchers will aid you in your sub-orbital flight. Again, otherwise, crackdown 1 gameplay. There are some new mini-games, but its basically go here and kill everything that moves. And some gratuitous finding missions. While those are as annoying as they ever are, they've at least made the concession that they're are fairly easy-to-spot markers to let you know something is nearby.

Probably the most annoying thing is the announcer. I like me my achievements, but when you're getting one every 30 minutes, and having it all but rubbed on your face, its loses anything resembling a feeling of achievement. ""Your first agility orb? Achievement!"" ""You fired a new weapon? Achievement!"" ""You managed to operate a toilet unaided? Achievement!""

Story is where is game runs straight down the tubes. After an opening cut scene, they is nothing in the way of briefings. You have one target, not the normal gang dossiers, and otherwise, one mission: kill stuff in this location, and move to another location. Not surprising, but when you're performing the exact same actions and just changing backgrounds, with nothing backing it up, it starts to feel like quest grinding.

Overall, Crackdown 2 is a clone of the original with pieces removed. That alone makes it a massive disappointment. So little effort was put into this to make it almost insulting that it took 3 years to complete. Apparently the thought was that removing story and making virtually every action warrant an achievement would gloss over the fact that all they did was add a multiplayer function, but what comes out it just a time waster. It may be just as much raw fun as the first, running, racing and blowing up stuff to your hearts content, but it feels like a empty husk of something that used to be great.","Crackdown, minus story, plus multiplayer",1278547200,57,,

2.0,False,"03 18, 2013",A3CZ51PEAPD0KD,B005THAX60,Shrapnel,"The only thing the demo and the actual game have in common is the title. The demo I saw had a squad of marines; filled with atmosphere; dynamic lighting, bloom...it looked amazing, something that I would expect from Gearbox, a company I used to equate with quality. What you get in the game, point blank, is NOT what was displayed in the demos. I would gladly pay full price for a full version of what the demo was showing, what I got was a dated; stripped down, corridor shooter from 2006 it seems.

So they knew they had trash on their hands and instead of canning it, or delaying it further (oh noe we might lose money) they decided to push this demo as much as they could as the actual game, added some sugar and tried to call this piece of crap a milkshake. I don't know how someone isn't being sued over this, as pretty much the demo they've been flaunting, is NOWHERE to be seen in the game. I guess they can do this because we are simply individual consumers- but the time is past due that there be some kind of regulation on this- this industry is making over $9Bil a year, off highway robbery like this, and Diablo 3, and FFXIII.

These devs get a little rep for a brand name then exploit it to high hell cause they know their name recognition is so high that they think they can push anything out and we'll just buy it. Well fool me one, shame on you, Fool me twice, I must be a GD idiot. And I'm not, so to all of you: STOP THE PRE-ORDERS. Once they cant get the easy money off their unrealistic playthrough demos (Blizzard pulled this same crap with D3), they'll realize that they'll actually have to make a quality game to earn their money.
Or at the very least, that consumers won't get fooled with this pre-order BS, and it's exactly that: SEND THE MESSAGE- STOP THE PRE-ORDERS.

So, lets talk of pros:
* Pulse Rifle sound effect (1 star)
* Aliens in headlights and the exploding hiss of dismembering them.
* Weapon upgrade system

Now let me explain my personal reason why this game failed:
* Should have called this Aliens: Revenge on Weyalnd Yutani- half the game you are killing humans...WHAT THE &#^$??!?!??!?!
I can chose, I don't know, 90+ titles off the top of my head where I can kill humans...only 1 that is licensed to create Xenomorphs, so:
* Why are you wasting resources on human targets...in an ALIEN game on LV-426...Home of the Queen??
* You get to use the smart gun 1 time...ONCE the whole game.
* You get to fight with the PowerLoader...ONCE...and its not even against the Queen.
* Aliens are too far and few between, no sense of fear or tension: At All. Worse yet, they came out out the exact same intervals and positions every single time so
your motion detector is useless after your 1st playthrough as you've learned all the spawn spots from your reloads.
* An ending that requires you to utilize absolutely nothing you've learned/aquired throughout the game and (except for the hardest level) involves absolutely no
combat
* Sentries get used 2 times and its NOTHING like the demo, which leads me to the #1 reason why this game fails
* It's not the demo. Or anything remotely resembling it. Last I checked demo was short for demonstration, as in A SAMPLE OF THE SAME PRODUCT YOU WILL BE SELLING US IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
* 17 weeks after a nuclear explosion, LV-426 is completely hospitable and funny enough, teeming with life
* Wont even go into the 'Mystery Marine'. Its fun to fight with him, until something in the back of your head says 'what are you even DOING here?'
* Multiplayer is horrid, and I fear will only get worse as the pre-orderers are leaving in droves-
No way to customize your lfg settings in online mode, you just search and hope you connect to an already existing game- if you've picked a co-op type people aren't playing you'll be waiting a looooong time.
So in summary, I probably should have bought this game and kept my head in the sand, this probably would have gotten 3/4 stars.

I started with my 2DS without update : big mistake. This game without the update takes a long time when it is enemies' turn. Sometime, you could wait a huge 90 sec. Even when I got my New 3DS with the update, every enemies' turn take around 20 seconds. Way to long.

The second big down is the fact that you start a battle without knowing if you need someone with some ability. For example, after 10 min in a battle, you may find that you should have taken someone that can jump. Well, you will have to redo the map to be able to get the bonus. Every battle is around 45 minutes, so forget about redoing.

The third big down is that it's hard to differentiate enemies. They all look the same until they hit you and now you realize that this one hit with long distance. Hence, very hard to have strategy.

On the pro side, the story is nice. I also liked every characters and the voices between maps. That said, I am disappointed and couldn't finish the game which is a second in about 75 games played.","Slow, hard to plan strategies, enemies look alike",1485907200,8,,

It's very much obviously a rip-off of Mario Kart, yet lacks in the fun you can have in that game with both in-game fun and mini-game fun. There are 4 or maybe 5 events, each with about 4 tracks to race on. You get a selection of Cartoon Network characters to choose from, with a heap to unlock later. Each car has it's own attributes and abilities, and probably special power ups, but I found this game to be one of those highly annoying games where its the karts you unlock later that go faster then the ones you have to put up with at first.

The tracks are much like a Mario Kart race... from circuits, beaches, deserts and schools etc to race on. The handling is decent once you get used to it, it's a standard racing game, one button to accelerate, one to brake, and one to use your power up item when you run into a block on the track. There is also a button to slide, but it's not for sliding (drifting) around corners, it's more a mostly useless button that you only need to make a sharp turn into an object or a quick slide to prevent hitting a wall, however, if you are used to Mario Karts slide, then don't bother trying it, you will just turn into a wall if you do.

The power-ups are identical to Mario Kart. Boosters, projectiles and things to leave on the track like mines and oil spills and what not. The whole thing is a watered down rip off of Mario Kart, and it was decent enough to be slightly fun at first, but it becomes completely annoying after a while when you are cruising along in first place, and every few seconds an opponent behind you has projectiles something at you... you see a warning icon, which I couldn't figure out why it would bother, as you can't defend it unless you have a temporary shield power up to activate... but I got so sick and tired of seeing that warning icon, then a stupid whistle sound as it collides into you and you tumble around in the air and land back on the track to resume racing... even tho it does not slow you down all that much and you can continue on with ease in first place... it was just irritating for it to keep happening every few seconds.

It's also one of those games where you have to collect things on the track to earn tokens to unlock things... these things are upgrades, mini games, new character/vehicles and some cartoons to watch... but whats annoying is some cost a ridicules amount... you can earn probably 1000 or so tokens for each championship... but to unlock the ""Black Sheep"" cartoon to watch, it will cost you 250,000... can any one really be bothered playing the game for that long to earn that many points/tokens/coins?

I can tell you now, if you want to see what you would get by wasting all that time unlocking everything, then when you enter your name for the game, type in ""GIMMIE"" and everything will be unlocked, but you will not be able to save any progress this was. This opens everything for you to see, and you can see the rest of the characters to unlock might get faster and better to use, but the mini games are a snore fest and the cartoons are a nice addition, as they are short, but full length episodes... but as I said, I don't watch Cartoon Network, so they did not appeal to me, but for someone who LOVES the shows, then unlocking 3 of them to watch without just imputing that GIMMIE name code, then you may be wrapped to be awarded with that feature to be unlocked.

Overall; it just become too repetitive, and more annoying as it went along. I just did not care to complete the whole game... if you own Mario Kart, you will see this is a major attempt to try and clone it, but it gets it all wrong in the end. Even tho the graphics aren't all that bad, and the controls are decent, there was just so much more that was needed to improve this game.

I enjoy RPGs as well including the Final Fantasy series, Dungeon Siege II, and Diablo II, but Elder Scrolls 3: Morrwind was just not a good game. Why you may ask?

Well my main problem with it is the battle interface, which is a primary aspect of the game. Hiting enemies, esspecally short ones, is very inaccurate and cumbersome, causing a great deal of fusteration. This completely ruins the 'fun' aspect of the game. Also, it can be occassionally difficult to figure out where you're going or what is happening. While this is true of many RPGs, I found it to be a much more significan issue with this game. I have a feeling that some of those who enjoy everquest type games will enjoy this, however, many casual RPGers and people who appreciate a good battle interface will not.

Also, while graphics are not that important to an RPG, this game is kind of weird here. Some aspects such as water and landscape are beautiful when the graphics are turned up. However, characters, monsters, etc., are very poorly rendered and akward looking and acting.

For some reason, the makers of the HD version left it at 30fps (plus or minus here and there, with odd judder occurring where you wouldn't expect it), which is a bizarre decision as the PS3 obviously has more than enough power to handle it at 60fps, even with the higher res graphics. The ideal solution would have been to base it on the PS2 version, yes, but bump the frame rate up to 60fps so it at least looks as good as the GC version frame rate wise. Speaking of the HD update, there are a lot of very jaggy lines (especially hair) and blurry textures that most HD updates I've played have just plain done a better job updating. Also, to me Lloyd's movement doesn't feel as crisp/precise as it did on Gamecube, maybe because of the slower frame rate.

I understand frame rate isn't important to some people, and some people can't even tell the difference between 30 and 60fps, but to me, frame rate is the most important thing when it comes to graphics (for example, on PC I will turn all settings down in order to get 60fps). So to me, it's a big disappointment that ToS isn't running at 60fps.

So with this review, I am calling attention to this HD conversion and this technical issue specifically, and my dissatisfaction with it, hence the 2 stars. Content-wise, ToS is a 5 star game and one of my favorite RPGs of all time, and I definitely do recommend it if you haven't played it before, but the issues have to be called out.

The Bocce game is probably the highlight of the game, play-wise.  You can move your person side-to-side, and change angle (as you can in Wii Sports Resort's bowling), and vary your throw based on how hard you swing the Wiimote.  Of all the games, this one seems to be the most refined towards it's subject matter.

Frisbee Golf isn't terrible.  You have a bit of control over the Frisbee based on how hard you throw, and what direction you're facing in with regards to the wind.  Once you get near the 'hole', it's almost impossible to miss, as the target extends upwards (meaning you can't throw it over the hole accidentally).

Gameplay for Cricket is fairly simplistic, similar to Baseball on Wii Sports.  With only two types of generic swings, batting is a matter of timing and force.  Actually, pitching is the same, but with even less ability to customize.  Ball catching and throwing is largely automatic.

Soccer and Football are largely wastes of time, where the player is merely along for the ride.  Soccer offers the ability to pass to the near player, pass to the furthest player, sorta shoot, and slide tackle.  You can change which player you control, but there's not really any movement control.  Football is similar:  Your main input is the timing and strength of the pass, and making the receiver jump to catch it.

Volleyball was the game that I, personally, was hoping would be good, and is therefore the biggest disappointment to me.  The control of this game is, in a word, pathetic.  The first guy to touch the ball ALWAYS digs.  The second guy ALWAYS sets.  The third guy (actually, the first guy again) ALWAYS spikes or shoots.  There is very little control to any of these actions.  The game is mostly reduced to flicking the controller and waiting.

I realize this is a title full of mini-games.  However, with these games, the potentially intuitive interface of the Wii has been reduced to something with all the creativity of button-mashing.

If I see this game in a $5 bin, I might buy it again.  IMHO, for any price over that, it's just not worth it.","Major disappointment, even at a discount",1271894400,2,,

The characters and art styles of the game were interesting this game reminded me of Max Payne. The problem is Max Payne was better and it came out what 8 years ago. The aiming for this shooter is a bit dated what saves it is that when you jump slide or shoot time is slowed down and ruby always lock on one target with her duel weapons allowing you to mow down enemies.

As I was looking at the reviews, I was surprised at how none of them... especially the negative ones missed the biggest problem with the game... IT JUST SIMPLY ISN'T FUN. The charisma, ingenuity and arcade style of the previous games is no longer here.

I have been a huge fan of entire ""previous"" NEED FOR SPEED series, except for maybe NFS: Shift. I was never looking for realism from the games. I always found the ""over the top"" racing incredible fun... the idea of outrunning the cops exilerating and the idea of reversing your role and becommming a cop was ingenious.

I've also had a great time playing The BURNOUT series as well. It was addictive seeing how much damage you could cause causing the biggest pileup scenario possible. It was a nice touch to give you a choice by winning races by either straight up racing or simply eradicating the competition through take downs.
Very satisfying indeed.

The above mentioned things were my favorite parts of NFS and Burnout. I was incredibly excited with the merger and couldn't wait to see what this game had in store. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. The racing is still ""over the top"", but it is so incredibly difficult that I don't know how anyone can be having a good time. After 20 times doing the same race and not even placing 3rd, it becomes more frustrating than it does fun. Navigating the track is mindboggling at times, there are no arrows to help guide your way, you're expected to keep your eye on your gps to know the right way. One wrong turn, or crash once and forget about it, you might as well start over... you will never catch up. Even if you are able to navigate the track effectively, the AI cars are always miliseconds behind you. Taking out an AI car can place you ahead of them, but they miraculously recover and spawn right back on your tail. The ""cop chases"" are here too, however it becomes quickly apparent that it will be more challenging than it will be fun. Still not sure how to lose cops... extreme speed doesnt work... taking side roads doesnt deter them... crazy routes keeps them on your tail... taking them down just causes more to spawn and any combination of the above is no more effective.

Gone are the possibilities of winning a race multiple different ways including takedowns, short-cuts and/or speed, only to be replaced by undefeatable AI... No more sole TAKEDOWN EVENTS... Eradicated are the events where you get to play the cop and chase the street racer... Destroyed are the events where you simply try to create the most mayhem possible... and Demolished is my faith in the new franchise.

I see what the creators are doing here. There is an attempt to make the racing seem like a simulator by making it extremely difficult... but I personally found this game so challenging, that it seems more like a chore than a pleasure. Not sure why the franchise is trying to be like every other racer out there when this merger gives the oppertunity to be so much more. Why not enhance what made the prior games so great instead of being like everyone else?

Aside from my disappointment, I do need to say that the graphics are exceptional. and there are a few glimmers of fun here, but they are few and far between and were consistentaly interrupted by the vulgarities that exit my lips as I loose another race for the 20th time in a row.",Simply Not Fun,1355097600,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have some Turtle Beach headphones that are slightly more expensive than these, but they do tend to become slightly uncomfortable after long periods of time.

So I ordered these. I was on the boat about the cord, but I actually prefer cords over wireless in such devices so that I don't have to worry about scrambling for batteries or charging it when the battery's low. The length of the cord is good for my living room.

When I plugged it into my PS3, having not yet read the instructions, I was surprised that there was no sound coming through. So I perused through the quick setup and was aghast that I, indeed, had to use the included audio jacks. I really really really really really don't like audio jacks. I understand that they might ""improve"" or have a work-around for audio, but the fact that I have to get my jacks out of my PS3 box just to plug `em into the back of the TV for audio (and since my TV has only one set of RCA ports, into which my Atari is plugged), it's really inconvenient and messy when I have to use the ol' red and white audio jacks. Haven't they done a work-around for this? I have HDMI cables, and I love `em. Surely Thrustmaster can do better. My Turtle Beach headphones, while understandably more expensive, connect into the front USB port...and that's it.

So when I finally did what Thrustmaster bid, I tried the sound quality, and it didn't negate my already negative feelings toward the headphones. The sound sounds almost tinny, and the headphones and their longest stretch barely fit `round my head, and I don't even have a big head! I usually click two or three times on headphones to make `em fit, but on these Thrustmasters I had to pull `em all the way and even then they fit just so.

I tried these on my iPhone, but the jack is a little big to fit with the case on my iPhone, so I took it out and tried the sound. It was rather worse since it was meant to utilize the red and white audio jacks.
Disgusting.

What is great about what you will see is that you probably haven't seen anything quite like it.

Sure, you've played sidescrollers and seen Japanese-style cartoon characters but screenshots just don't tell the whole story here. The characters have a motion that somehow allows a 2D cartoon character to come alive. Beyond that, there is just an enormous amount of detail poured into the environments that you just don't see in other 2D realms.

That said, there are just a number of flaws that bring this would-be giant to its knees. I'll only focus on the most important: Gameplay. Be prepared to be frustrated. When you first start out, you will be puzzled by seemingly unresponsive button presses. As you play you will learn that presses just don't register while the character is carrying out the current action. What this amounts to is slowly and carefully timing your buttons with the animations, which is incredibly counter intuitive and clumsy- especially when you have five to ten bad guys bum-rushing you at high speed. Your natural tendency is to mash away, which will ultimately result in your demise.

In the end, this game may be worth the bargain price, but only as a whimsical (and short) diversion for those dry spells between major new releases.

Beautiful art meets clumsy controls

Pros:
-Absolutely wonderful art and animations
-Unique concept of combining action and RPG elements (albeit not masterfully executed)

Cons:
-Frustratingly clumsy controls

This pack opens doors a bit wider in the series and makes the game more fun to play. But, it's quite not enough to only have 3 professions to choose from. From what I see that this is the only down fall. However, the flipside is that if your sims are in one of these professions, the pathway to stardome is extremly challenging which makes it much fun and strategic. (At the time of this review,) I haven't really gotten into the guts of the professions, however again the big annoyance is constant posting to Facebook and the Sims 3 Forum. (In my opinion only) this feature should have never been added. But since it was, I'm glad you can turn it off if you don't plan moving your characters around.

I really don't care for this perk because every time you start a new sim, you end up cluttering your board with new shots that will be deleted. Now sending you sim to a friends game is a awsome idea! I haven't tried that part yet because my sims haven't gotten that far in the careers plus I don't know anyone on the forms well enough to post my sims.

So why buy the Expansion pack? Like all the previous games in the this series each builds on the others and add new features and enhancements. Some of them are awsome and some are annoying but either way you look at it the end series makes each expansion and stuff pack worth it for the complete series.

The items that it offers are, I guess, okay, but there just don't seem to be that many more items in my game since I installed this stuff pack.

Unfortunately Cryptic took a giant leap backwards in both Champions Online and Star Trek Online.  Their graphics and controls both have taken about a 10-year leap backwards.  Clumsy controls on the PC and very awkward fighting.  What happened to the clean City of Heroes graphics that still look good?  Cryptic said it was to give Champions Online a ""comic-book"" feel.  Well - it just looks like a 1990's FPS game to me.  And they also use the same engine in their new game Star Trek Online???  Someone at Cryptic needs to stand up and say ""our new graphics engine is @#$#"".  A sci-fi game like Star Trek deserves far better graphics and controls.

As for classes and powers in Champions online... you'll see that they are all almost exactly the same as City of Heroes.

I can only attribute the terrible controls as an awkward attempt at immitating some features from WOW.  Cryptic tried adding some equipment and it's one of the worst attempts I've seen.  They failed miserably in both Champions and Star Trek here.

As much as I loved City of Heroes, I have to say that both of their new games are simply garbage.  If you haven't tried City of Heroes yet, it's a must try.  It's a great game and a good alternative for people tired of WOW.  But these 2 new games from Cryptic really seems like the end of a franchise to me.

2.0,False,"10 17, 2016",A2VK3XIMS859OJ,B01GJMAOL2,The Saylors,"Ok here we go. First off this is my first delve into the xcom series but i have played through it to completion so its time to review. Let me also say that i bought this as a digital download on xbox one but i prefer to do my reviews here. I am no scrub when it comes to strategy games (long time rts player) and have been gunning people down on xbox since the beginning. At first xcom pissed me off, the difficulty level is very high even on lower settings at least in the first half of the game. If you make it past the halfway mark you will likely have an easier time towards the end but until then be ready to do a few restarts. The turn based game play, though not anything new, was a refreshing break from the normal day of fps and rts. The player models (when static) look pretty good and i liked that the characters appearances were randomly generated. Also the world map starting location and seemingly the non essential mission maps were also randomized making no play through the same. The story as a whole is kinda bland and there isn't any prologue to catch up players that didn't play the prior games leaving me feeling lost and without a purpose other than ""try not to die"". So if all was well at this point i would have given this game 4 stars, but then we get to the bugs. This game is beyond riddled with bugs both on the visuals side and on the game play side. The cut scenes featuring the random generated characters has a frame rate of half or less than the story cut scenes making everything feel very choppy and sometimes i would see incomplete loading of finishing textures making it look terrible. Some of the story cut scenes would have out of sinc sound to what was happening on screen, very annoying. I can get past a hand full of visual bugs but these were literally every few seconds making it kinda unforgivable. There are a few game play bugs like telling a character to move to cover and they get to within one block and just stop out in the open for the turn often getting himself shot. The enemies will sometime get stuck and fall through the map or just disappear, killing them. Objectives not being able to be shot even though you are standing on the objective just because the game thinks you haven't ""sighted"" it. There are a quite a few more to the point were i could write a book about it. The short of it is that this game had a TON of potential but needed another year or two of bug testing before release. I had the game crash while trying to load a mission 3 times during the campaign, luckily the auto save system works but its still a pain as the loading screens are VERY long. The final nail in the coffin was the final cut scene and up until this point i was at 3 stars for the game... i played the final mission, which is quite long, to arrive at the ending cut scene. The ending cut scene for games is very important, its the culmination of all your efforts being payed off with a completed story and some nice visuals...... Then the ending cut scene played with no sound, ZERO. Dead silence. i was so mad that i threw down my controller and went outside to smoke. I was furious. I still have no idea what the ending was about and i won't bother looking it up. This is the first time that i have seriously contemplated trying to get my money back on a game, games are art and therefore are not guaranteed to please you but they SHOULD AT LEAST BE COMPLETE!!!

These sorts of cables for multiple systems are typically crappy. And when the S-Video cable is also split into a yellow video cable, the signal is split. That split results in a checkerboard pattern.

And sadly thats the case with these rather attractive looking cables. What a waste. Oh well, live and learn. At least they were cheap I guess. I don't blame the seller, but the manufacturers are pretty much just dishonest about the product they are selling.

I posted in the COH forums before beta and even beta tested the game from the beginning till its release in stores. I continue to be a subscriber of this MMORPG. Here is the lowdown for COH: This game is probably by far one of the best MMORPG's out to date. Character creation is absolutely amazing - a gamer has so many choices to choose from and even if one was to sketch out their character design on paper first and to mimic that character design in the COH character creator screen that person will not be disappointed as it copies it to a ""T."" The hero one makes starts out with 2 powers at level 1 and he or she picks another power at level 2. It is quite easy to level your character to level 10 and above... things slow down however as the character hits the early level 20's as the xp needed to level is greatly increased. There currently is no xp decay but instead when a hero falls in battle a debt system is carried over where the hero gets half the xp he or she normally would gain from defeating thugs. Missions ingame are another thing that could either be seen as enjoyable or a complete nightmare. As of now missions are divided up into 2 categories: you have the search and arrest X amount of thugs on streets and you have the so common indoor missions (which vary from caves, warehouses, tech labs, etc). The game claims that the most important thing that distinguishes this MMORPG from another is the story arc that evolves around your hero. Here is a warning tho to all gamers that are planning on purchasing this game: The story arcs that normally would give you soveniors (which is the trophy one gains after completing a story arc that consists of a dozen or so missions intertwined together), may be bugged so u can never finish the story arc, the story arc may become outleveled or the contact that should give you a story arc becomes outleveled which normally means that a hero that is higher level then the story arc would not net that story arc to completion. An example is if a hero that is level 20 would not be able to do the level 14 Bonefire Skulls/Hellions story arc adventure because he or she has surpassed the lower level that the mission should have been given. I found this outleveling of story arcs out when I played the first month of COH. This is one of the most complained about issues on the forums by many players. Conclusion is that the developers don't plan to lift the outleveling of story arc content anytime soon.. so one must decide on two things:
1) You can play the game socially and group with people gaining experience points at a fast rate only to outlevel the main story arcs and never be allowed to do them in the future. Of course if you were to get 2 bugged story arcs you will never get to do future story arcs even ones of your level.
2) You can play the game anti-socially and never group with people thus just doing mission after mission assigned by your contacts until you finish all the story arcs in the game with your character. Simply if you care for the game content story arcs then play the game as if it was a single player game and not a MMORPG.
As for updates and patches... patches so far go through live period on the servers once every month. If one were to expect changes, don't expect it anytime soon. The devs do take some of our ideas into consideration but most of it is only cosmetic ideas such as ""wanting capes"" or ""4 different costumes for one hero in the game."" When it comes down to fixing bugs, potential things that may gimp your character, or story arc/game content fixes, the gamer will be out of luck because such matters are of no concern to the Cryptic studios creative team. Every MMORPG game has its pros and cons... it is up to the gamer to decide if any of these are worth his or her time.

Despite all the hype, this game takes some steps forward and some steps back, much like Sims 3. But unlike Sims 3, I'm not fully convinced yet that the improvements outweigh the omissions. But because I know different people enjoy different aspects of this game, I'm breaking my review into different components to help you evaluate whether it is for you.

Create A Sim and Build Mode

True to the marketing, these are the best parts of the game. I found them to be an improvement over Sims 3 both in terms of what you're able to customize and how user-friendly the interface makes it to do it. However, there were still some aspects taken away for unknown reasons, so it isn't a total improvement. That said, if you enjoy customizing your Sims and building houses, I think you'll enjoy these updates on the whole. For Create A Sim, gone are sliders. Instead, you sculpt your Sim like clay, pulling and pinching places on your Sim to adjust different parts of their appearance. I've made 11 Sims so far and it's clear that you have much more control over even the smallest details. It makes it easier to make a Sim to capture someone's likeness, or a range of completely distinct characters. At first the method of sculpting takes some getting used to, but the more I played around with it, the more I prefer it over the previous versions. A couple tips I figured out where to leave your sim bald and unclothed until you're happy with the Sim's face and body shape. Sure you can adjust with hair and clothes on, but removing them made it much, much easier to see the full impact of the changes I was making while I was still figuring out the new method of making Sims. It also helped to remember I can rotate the Sim and that sometimes, it's easier to sculpt from a side angle vs. the front or vice versa depending on what you are attempting to do. As with the previous games, you can name your Sims and give them a goal and traits. But there are also new ways to give them personality through more control over their voice and the ability to choose a walk stride for them (i.e. feminine, bouncy, swagger, etc.). It's definitely another fun way to make your Sim characters unique and more real. That said, there were a couple of things I noticed that seemed like a downgrade after the previous version. The outfits, while fun and fashion forward, seem pretty limited. There also seems to be no way to custom color different items (i.e. hair, skin tone) or to use a range of patterns and colors for outfits. This also holds true for Build Mode As Well. I love that in Build Mode it's easier for me to shape my house to make it the way I want and that I have more control over some items, like wall height, but I miss being able to personalize my houses with more colors and textures.

Overall Interface

In going from Sims 2 to Sims 3 I found the overall interface to be more similar than different. It had increased customization of game play, which meant more menus, but overall everything seemed to be laid out similarly. This isn't the case with Sims 4. It looks and feels dramatically different. From an aesthetics standpoint, the layout and menus look better, but are not very intuitive to an experienced player. I am sure some of the initial frustration of this will diminish over time as the layout becomes more familiar, but for right now, most of the changes don't intuitively feel like an improvement. The only change I do like is how the current and planned actions are displayed. In particular, it's easier to understand when a Sim is multitasking and becomes clearer who they are talking to in group situations.

Graphics

Given that my computer specs aren't great, I was impressed with how this game looks. The visuals definitely look more appealing and up to date than Sims 3.

Gameplay

With Sims 3, I gameplay was where I felt the game had made the biggest improvements. With Sims 4 it is the opposite. Quite honestly, once I'd created my Sims and customized my houses I found the rest of the game to be a disappointment. I was really looking forward to the addition of emotions because I wanted Sims that would be more nuanced and 'real,' but these haven't seemed to have as big an affect on my game experience as I expected. At least in my game experience, they were kind of neat at first, but then the appeal wore off. There are also some new actions and tasks, but again they are the kind of thing that I found fun to discover at first and then lost novelty quickly. The careers have also changed, and for me it wasn't a good change. If you like unusual, exciting, quirky careers you'll probably like this new batch better. Maybe I'm boring, but I like my Sims to have careers that mirror real life so mine were often on the business or medicine track. Not sure if they are saving this for a University Life expansion pack, but they were sorely missed. But probably the biggest disappointment is the way the world is laid out. The downtown portion of the city is no longer seamlessly integrated into the overall neighborhood, if you want to go there you experience a load screen instead of taking a taxi, driving, etc. to your destination. Thankfully the load time is very, very quick, even though I am running the minimum specs for this game. But it feels less real and like a definite downgrade. Maybe this was to deal with overall game performance issues, and I will admit my game does run much more smoothly than Sims 3, but I'd almost take a little bit of lag to have the old layout back. It makes it harder to toggle between family members who are at home and family members who are a friend's house or out on the town. The world in general also feels tiny and not as rich or interesting as those in Sims 3. The businesses you can visit are much more limited, which makes gameplay boring unless you have homebody Sims. There are also fewer residential lots which means fewer sims to meet.

Objects/Buy Mode

Like Sims 3, the objects included in the base game are pretty limited. It's definitely been clear that they want to push people to buy Expansion Packs and Stuff Packs once those are available. By the 4th installment of this game I'm pretty used to having to purchase these to expand play, but to me it seems like with Sims 4 it is almost required if you enjoy personalizing your home. And of course it doesn't help if you are an early adopter and these haven't been released yet.

So far, I'm very torn on how I feel about the Sims 4. Given how much the game experience was hyped, as a standalone experience, Sims 4 is pretty disappointing. It feels like the most fun part of the new game is creating your Sim and their house, not actually playing with them. I have no doubt that gameplay will be richer once expansion packs are released, but it means that an enjoyable play experience ends up being rather expensive and also requires you to wait until expansion packs are released. Even though I do think the graphics of Sims 4 look better and much prefer the Sims I've made in Sims 4 vs. Sims 3 I'm feeling bored with Sims 4 already and am feeling the desire to keep playing with Sims 3 until more content is released. Mostly I'm feeling like shame on me. EA/Maxis gave little incentive to buy this on day one and still I did it anyway. I could see where this game would be fun for those who are new to the Sims franchise since you don't have preconceived notions of the game and if you have never played before there is enough to explore and learn in the game. But for those who have been playing since the first Sims, it's a little lackluster.","Despite being a loyal Sims fan, Sims 4 is just okay",1409788800,18,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Instant Access'}",
3.0,False,"08 21, 2006",A26G35WR7QCFR2,B000BI4GP6,Kevin R. Haughn,"In late 2002, I took a second job at a major electronics retailer and decided to use my employee discount on what looked like a cool game: Civilization III.  That game changed my life... in the gaming sense.  It was everything I ever thought a computer game should be: turn-based strategy with multiple avenues to test my ego and self-promoted genius.  Above all features of Civ3, however, my most favorite was the customization of the game through the map editor and the wonderful online resources of the Civ community.  (I've downloaded more Civ3 files than MP3s.)  This allowed me to express my self-proclaimed genius with new rules, technologies, and units (and all the accompanying chronologies and requisites) at my discretion.  Nothing could get any better, I had thought.

When Civ4 was being talked about, however, I couldn't imagine on what grounds they could improve - except perhaps making the game even more customizable and thorough.  Well, you've already read about the differing features of the game: less micro-management, more diplomatic and trade features, new technology trees, enhancing popular mechanics found in previous Civ titles, and of course, going 3D with it all.

When playing Civilization IV, you sense an overwhelming POTENTIAL to be a really great game.  In my mind, that potential has not been fulfilled, and I hereby advise you to purchase Civ3 Complete instead and forego Civ4 if you haven't chosen so already.  If you have already purchased Civ4, let's send a message to Firaxis Games that they need to do better - let's stop purchasing Civ products until they are actually without so many bugs, that aren't rushed to be released for the holidays, and that don't insult our intelligence by requiring expensive ""expansion packs"" which merely add content that should already have been included in the original release.

Here is a list of comparative reasons to only own Civ3 and not Civ4 and boycott future Civ titles until something changes for the better:

1.  There is no map editor in Civ4.  Instead, they included a ""World Builder"" which is so awkward and strange.  It is not like Civ3's map editor where you can set starting positions, resources, civilizations, and terrain BEFORE you play the map.  The ""World Builder"" of Civ4 only allows you to alter scenarios from the installation or randomly generated maps.  You cannot create maps from scratch - you can only change what has already been created within predefined parameters.

2.  Who needs 3D graphics for a turn-based strategy game?  Civ4 is not fully 3D; it merely allows a tilting view from ground level to overhead.  That can be cool, but consider the offset: it is unnecessary for this genre, it diverts computer resources from other cool and more thorough features, and it makes the game extremely difficult to modify.  For Civ3, there are well over 1,000 things you can either download or make yourself and put right into the game.  You don't have to know XTML or Python programming languages as you would in Civ4.  Civ4 requires advanced education (like a graphics design or computer science degree) to simply alter things like governments, units, buildings, and game rules.  Waiting for others to design them (like the amateur online community or the professional expansion packs) isn't so fun anymore.

3.  Expanding content for more money?  This was a problem with Civ3, as well - its first expansion pack was a total waste of money because everything was later put on the second expansion pack.  People bought the first expansion pack because they loved Civ3 so much and didn't know it was a waste.  (Many video game makers are taking advantage of gamers in this way, not just the Civilization makers.)  My point here is to fight back.  We already know what they are going to pull: Civ4 has an expansion pack out there titled Warlords.  It basically includes elements intentionally left out so as to somehow formulate a ""new"" product.  In the base version of Civ4, you have the Great People: artists, scientists, merchants, and prophets.  Hmmm... now we get the warlords, eh?  Oh, and a few other civilizations and buildings left out from before.  Nice try...  Boycott this type of marketing out of sheer principle.  Play Civ3 Complete until Civ5 comes out if you have to.  Maybe Civ will be less of a cheap shot then.

4.  The last reason why you should be content with Civilization III and completely forget that Civilization IV was ever made is the most simple.  Purchasing Civ3 Complete right now (1) will cost you less than half of Civ4; (2) is fully expanded while Civ4 is still looking to make more money off of us; and (3) Civ3 has the very same level of addictive game play as any other Civilization title.  If you have already dropped the cash for Civ4, simply do not support Civ4 any longer.  In fact, uninstall it and put it in your drawer as a sad chapter of shameless marketing.  Yes, Civ4 is fun, but it is does not live up to its potential in most ways.  Playing Civ3 will take up your time quite nicely until they release a REAL title that doesn't take advantage of us so blatantly.

To conclude, my overall point to stick with Civ3 and forego Civ4 is this: without an easy, efficient, and overwhelmingly powerful customizing interface (like an awesome map editor that allows FULL customization), we are simply asking for ""re-tread"" products.  The fact that Firaxis did not include a kick-butt map editor proves in my mind that they expect us to wait for their ""expansions"" to come out and spend at least $150 each before they move onto Civ5.  Hold out with Civ3 Complete and wait until Civ4 goes away.",Hold Out with Civ3 Complete Instead,1156118400,35,,

You have to earn points and level up before you can use better weapons and use different maps. So if you go into one of those popular 32 player bodycount matches, you'll be constantly blown up by people who get to spawn with rocket launchers and shotguns just because they're at a higher rank. You might suggest doing a game search ""in your own rank"". Ha, good luck finding a game if you're just starting out. It's also very hard to gain points so that you can level up.

For instance, you can't earn points by killing bots, it has to be another person. If you have a friend with the game, then you can set up a custom game and earn points by killing each other or cheating at objective games, but it still takes a long time.

3.0,True,"11 13, 2013",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B00GGUT7E8,Raul G.,"Working down my backlog of games I finally had the chance to play and beat Bioshock Infinite. As a big fan of the first two games I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Infinite. While the game was in development I had the chance to read a few articles and see a few early pictures of the development of the game. Having finished the game I can definitively say that Bioshock Infinite is... just okay. In trying to create something different enough to be called new yet similar enough to be called Bioshock, Irrational Games, the development studio behind the series, has created a strange in-between game that comes off as considerably less charming and less engaging that previous Bioshock titles.

---------------------
STORY:
You are Booker Dewitt, a veteran of the US Army and the battle of Wounded Knee, and a former employee of the infamous Pinkerton Detective Agency. Your charge is to infiltrate the sky-city of Columbia and retrieve a girl named Elizabeth. All the information you're given is that you have a debt and by retrieving the girl the debt will be paid. What unfolds after Booker enters Columbia is an interesting story that follows many of the same lines as the original Bioshock title.

The leader of Columbia, a man named Comstock is a god-like figure that Columbians' refer to simply as, ""the prophet"". Comstock's persona is represented in almost every aspect of life in Columbia, from larger-than-life statues scattered about to entire floating-islands dedicated to his life. Clearly this is a cult of personality. Comstock is similar to Andrew Ryan in that both reject the meddling of the United States for similar reasons and set about creating their own utopian society that goes horribly wrong.

---------------------
GRAPHICS
The graphics are again very similar to Bioshock. Character models and the look and feel of everything from buildings to art style are almost identical to that of the original titles. The major change of course is the setting. Columbia floats high above the land and seas below. The graphics are a mixed bag, however. Outside areas (and there are many) in Columbia take on an almost blinding sheen. Everything outside is annoyingly bright and blurred giving the graphics a very soft almost dream-like state. Perhaps that is intentional but I found it extremely annoying. Interior areas are better and feature excellent use of lighting to lend the environments different characteristics. The first area you encounter after you enter Columbia, a temple-like setting where new citizens of Columbia are baptized are excellent examples of the lighting effects as daylight pours through different colored stained glass lending a somber, meditative state to the level.

The other obvious complaint with the graphics is that the original Bioshock was released in 2007 and little has changed.

---------------------
GAMEPLAY:

Gameplay in Infinite is, as you'd imagine, very similar to the previous Bioshock titles. This is a first person shooter with the added benefit of magic-like powers. Except know the powers are known as ""vigors"" instead of plasmids. Vigors are pretty much exactly like plasmids with few cursory changes. Instead of injecting vigors you drink them. Vigors use ""salt"" and salt can be replenished by drinking salts scattered around the game, buying them outright from vending machines or acquiring `gear' that imparts salts when certain criteria is met.
As Booker you're allocated four-slots to equip `gear' which is a not so clever way of granting passive abilities to the player. For example some gear might impart a bonus for melee attacks that lights enemies on fire or another piece of gear might increase your weapon accuracy while riding sky-lines.

The single biggest change is the addition of Elizabeth who after you rescue is a NPC that accompanies you on your journey through Columbia. Really when all of the other tweaks and setting change is boiled away, Infinite is about Elizabeth. Happily she is a contributing member of your part and she is essentially invulnerable. She takes care of herself, hides during battles and even scouts out the surrounding area to provide Booker ammunition, health, and money. Elizabeth plays a central role in the story and has the ability to open tears which are essentially windows into parallel universes. Her power comes especially handy in the heat of battle where Elizabeth can open a tear to provide you with health items or ammo or even a friendly sentry gun.

All told your adventure through Bioshock Infinite will probably take around a dozen hours. There are 51 trophies all told and all of them are offline.

---------------------
THE GOOD:
(+) The story is generally good though things can get confusing especially toward the end
(+) Graphics are a mixed bag - interior areas retain the same moody atmospherics that were so prevalent in the original Bioshock titles
(+) Elizabeth; she is a contributor more than a drain and constant source of frustration (a la Resident Evil 4) more NPCs should be modeled after her

---------------------
THE BAD:

(-) Graphics frequently appear white-washed and blurry particularly in outdoor areas
(-) Same basic graphics as the 2007-released Bioshock, in other words the engine is dated
(-) Very little has changed besides the setting; other changes (e.g. vigors) are simply renamed properties from previous Bioshock games
(-) The story has plenty of plot holes and contradictions

---------------------
CONCLUSION:

Bioshock Infinite is a good enough game that I recommend purchasing it especially at the reduced price it's selling for currently. However, that doesn't diminish the fact that this is essentially the same game that was released 6 years ago with a different setting.

3.0,True,"03 17, 2018",AJV2L53BJLNUA,B00KF7BEFS,BWhitcomb,"There are two games that come with this disc. The first, Metro 2033, shows its age, even with a remaster. This is not a problem, in general, but becomes a point of frustration when you realize that the controls are clunky and are not quite adequate for the type of enemies and combat that are required. Many of the mutant enemies are very fast and trying to fight them with what feels like a bad camera, slow reloads on a gun and virtually no ammo, makes for a frustrating experience.

The story is somewhat interesting and the atmosphere can be intriguing at times. However, I found myself becoming more frustrated as I moved forward in the game. This is not really a run and gun type of game. You have to have a mixture of stealth and gun play. The age of this game makes the levels very repetitive and all the the same. There is no hand holding at all, so you must have the patience to figure out where to go and what to do. Often, you are left scratching your head and wondering it you took a wrong turn.

I ended up quitting the first game and starting the second, Metro Last Light. There was a noticeable improvement in graphics and narration. This game felt more immersive, and the game play is initially fun, with lots of opportunities to be stealth and get in those headshots. Ammo is much more abundant and some people hate that. You spend about the first half of the game dealing with human enemies, which for good or bad, has a little of that COD feel. However, as you progress, they start dumping mutants on you in situations that once again, become frustrating. All of a sudden, you get stuck in areas where your mask filters run out every few seconds and often there are none to be found. You begin to deal with the same mutant in your face frustration and not being able to really reload your gun and deal with them as much. Once you get to the swamp level, the frustration ramps up. I had to start the chapter over due to not having any filters and then having to run through an entire area, rather than explore and enjoy what was an attractive outdoor map. There's some frustrating boss fights and you can find yourself dying from no air filters right when you kill the boss. The developers seem to be trolling the player.

I went from liking this game to just wanting to get done with it. Much of it felt that ""Cheap"" difficulty. Literally, kill 20 mutants, move to next room, wait on elevator, kill 20 more mutants, repeat. These kinds of situations can be fun if combat and supplies are adequate, but that doesn't exist here. I will say that much of the gun mechanics are nicely done, but again, having to reload every few seconds when mutants are smacking you in the face, is just not fun and leads to aggravation.

I would say that if you are a hard core gamer and like a challenge, then you'll probably love this. If you are more casual and don't like frustration, then avoid this.

People thought that movies needed singing along with whatever other plot elements might be in place.  Movies were a combination of movie and music video.  It was a mandatory formula.  In video games these days, the developers think that I want a combo video game/movie.  I am typing this right now while I wait for a cutscene, which I can't skip, to end.  When the joystick stops working and it's time to stop playing and switch to strictly watching, this is supposed to be okay with someone who was up to a moment ago playing a game.  One game I played recently had a mini cut-scene every checkpoint, where the joystick would deactivate and I would get to watch my sergeant tell me what to do next.  I don't mind these in Halo so much, since the graphics and concepts are so far out, but when I have to hear for five minutes an old man tell me about how his wife needs medicine and I have to go get it, and how much he loves her, that's when I say, it makes me want to throw the joystick.  Cut out the cut scenes!  Even worse is where you are supposed to hold the joystick forward while the developers visual delights pass you by, like the opening credits for Arkham Asylum, and you can't complete it until you move forward through the whole thing.  It's making a monkey out of the customer is what it is.

No need to ever be chained to the PlayStation that way even if your charge is low.

Interface: Things could be clearer to me or at least show me what button does what. I got lost here at first and couldn't figure out what the heck buttons move me in and out of the interface only to realize I was focusing on the buttons when I should of been trying to use the D-Pad.

It was sold as an mmo/rpg space opera shooter with an expansive story and galaxy spanning exploration.  From those categories, I can give it different scores.

System, Music, and Graphics
First, the graphical and gameplay aspect.  In this area, Destiny shines.  It is well polished, graphically impressive, and easy to handle.  The music is top notch.
-5/5 rating

mmo/rpg elements
This is where the game is the weakest.  MMO-wise, it is pretty terrible.  You cannot type to chat.  You are limited to 4 emotes mapped to a controller button.  It is difficult to form a party with people.  People in your party might not have headsets plugged in and won't hear you or be able to talk with you.  They can wander off and not really help you at all.  The process for joining or forming parties is cumbersome.  In the first 20 hours of playing, I have had 1 person join my fireteam (even though I had it open to all and invited people often).  So socially, it is an single player game where you see other people are playing.  The Tower area advertised as a social hub really just has people standing around dancing.  There is no way to communicate so there really isn't any other way to interact.  I found it immersion breaking to see people just dancing with npcs.  You are told the galaxy is threatened by darkness, but have people breaking that dark atmosphere by dancing childishly.

Rpg-wise, Destiny flops terribly.  Almost nothing is explained or resolved.  There are three playable races...but what are the Awoken?  Are they aliens?  Are they evolved humans?  You'll never know.  There are multiple alien attacking races.  But if you don't read the website explanation, you get zero insight as to who they are or why they are attacking Earth (and attacking each other).  You start off in what feels like the middle of a story.  I kept hoping it would come back and explain the back story of what happened to Earth, to the Traveler, etc  but it never does.  None of the mysteries are resolved.
Now, I know the main argument against this point is 'the game is supposed to span multiple years, installments, and expansions'.  That being said, as an rpg fan, it is a cardinal sin to release a game without a complete story.  If it had a whole and fulfilling story on release, and each expansion and sequel built off it, that would be one thing.  What you get is chapter 2 of a 10 chapter novel.
You only go to Earth, the Moon, Mars, and Venus.  So not a lot of 'galaxy exploration'.  And finally, the actual story chapters follow the following format: get to point, scan with ghost, face hoard of enemies.  The ghost narrates 90% of the story.  There are some story cutscenes.
-1/5 Rating

Shooter
In this area, I cannot complain.  The game controls very well.  It has very well balanced abilities and weapons.  The enemies are smart and tough without being unfairly tough.  The crucible deathmatch areas provide vs multiplayer that is a lot of fun.  The strikes provide team based multiplayer that is also a lot of fun and pretty well balanced.  As a non shooter regular player, I found the shooter aspect of this game to be the most polished and very entertaining part of the game.
-5/5 Rating

Expansions
This is just a personal point of contention for me.  2 ""expansions"" have already been announced.  They have 1 new story mission, a strike, and a crucible.  The first says it will re-use existing maps.  Cost $20 for one, or 2 for $35.  So I bought a $60 game with an unfinished story and will have to pay $20 every 2-3 months to continue the story?  Not to mention that $20 is pretty steep for such minimal content.  To me, it feels like a cash grab.
-Rating on the idea 0/5

Conclusion
As I said to begin, this game will be divisive. If you wanted a grand story, it will disappoint.  If you wanted a great shooter with polish and great balance, it absolutely delivers.  And if you aren't a fan of nickel and dime cash grabs for content that should be included with retail version of the game, then definitely wait for a bundle that contains all the expansions in a year or two.
Overall, I would give this game a 3/5 stars.",Mileage will vary depending on what you are looking for,1410825600,351,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,False,"01 29, 2012",AN81JUYW2SL24,B0057OW94E,Dr. Speed,"Mad Catz Wireless Force Feedbacking Racing Wheel, Xbox 360

The Mad Catz wheel set is designed for the Xbox 360 and is advertised to be directly compatible with modern racing games like Forza 4. I evaluated this wheel set with Forza 4, but I have also owned the Logitech G25, Logitech G27 (both designed for the PC and PS3), and Logitech Driving Force GT (designed for PC/PS3). My favorite is the Logitech G27, although the Driving Force GT is a far simpler (keep it simple) approach that does the job just fine - mainly because there isn't a single racing sim that accurately models a clutch either by design or programming issues.

There aren't many good steering wheel sets available for the Xbox 360. The PC and PS3 have several decent wheel sets to choose from. Several people have recommended the Fanatec, but I have not used it in person. Everyone raved about the G25/G27 when it first came out, so I am hesitant to shell out big bucks for another wheel set that is just going to sit in my closet.

First off is the installation and mounting. The wheel itself has several rubber base nubs that provide a friction grip to a table surface, or you can opt to use the screw-on lap pads (which I do not recommend for a good racing experience). If mounted incorrectly, the wheel will slip around. The locking mechanism is a cruder version of that used on the G25 and G27. There's one gigantic threaded knob that clamps the desk but this is a very big clamp and interferes with my gaming desk slide-out keyboard tray. The clamp also has to get well under the table, so many coffee tables won't suffice either. If you don't clamp it as deep, the wheel will slip because the biggest rubber pad is no longer gripping the table.

You can opt to use the sequential shifter knob on either side of the wheel, to simulate left-hand or right-hand driving. There's nothing special about this knob other than that the knob itself is wrapped in a metal shell. It is not tactile, so you don't feel/hear a click to indicate successful up or downshifting. The paddle shifters are not tactile either, you don't hear or feel a click like on the G27.

The steering wheel uses straight cut gears, so it sounds like the Logitech G25 and Driving Force GT, it whirrs and whirrs like a cheap toy, but it does the job. The Logitech G27 solved this by using helical cut gears for a silent approach. The steering wheel also has VERY limited steering lock. I count about 270 degrees lock to lock, and this is far too small to negotiate many hairpin turns in FOrza 4. As a matter of fact, I had difficulty in turn 1 at Laguna Seca driving a Ford GT. I had it at maximum lock and felt that I could have turned the in-game wheel even more had I used the controller. I am used to the Logitech G27's far more flexible steering lock adjustment (up to 900 degrees if I recall correctly). The steering wheel itself is a very small diameter wheel, and I'm not as used to it since the steering wheels in most cars are several inches larger in diameter, but the G27 and Driving Force GT are about the same size as the Mad Catz.

The pedals on the Mad Catz are abysmal to be truthful. The foot rest and assembly is feather light so it tends to flop around. It relies on your heels to hold it in place, unlike the G25/G27/DFGT pedals that have a heavy base with spines that stick into your carpet or rubber pads for smooth floor surfaces. The actual pedals on the Mad Catz are cheap plastic with rubber pads, and there is zero resistance for the brake and throttle pedals. They feel exactly the same and I kept locking up my brakes in Forza 4 because it was way too easy to bottom out the brake pedal. The G25/G27 pedals have different resistances to simulate the feel you get in a real car.

In addition, the Mad Catz pedals are spaced very very far apart like it was designed for an old person car like a Crown Victoria or Buick. This is a very far cry from the closely spaced pedals on the G25/G27 and real cars like the Mustang, Nissan 370, and Audi S5. Since they are spaced so far apart, I find myself using both feet to drive, Formula 1-style, but the lack of resistance/force on the brake pedal makes it hard to modulate the brakes properly.

Setting up the wheel assembly with Xbox wasn't too bad, finding the CONNECT button on my Xbox 360 Slim took longer than I'd expected mainly because I rarely had to use it in the past. With the G25/G27/Driving Force GT, installation on the PC was a bit more involved followed by countless hours of adjusting and tweaking the settings in Windows as well as the game itself.

The overall construction and quality of the Mad Catz wheel is very good. The buttons are well designed and simulate a hybrid Xbox controller with a wheel and paddles. The metal parts feel very refined, but do little to add to realism. Turning on the wheel always freaks me out because I hold the Xbox Guide button and the wheel spins a little.

Playing Forza 4, I found that the force feedback was a bit strong by default. I was fighting the wheel a lot of times, but it was MUCH easier to control my drifts and to recover from a spin. However, the lack of feel from the brake pedal really diminished the visceral driving experience. I was much better in Forza 4 using the controller versus this wheel set. I wish the wheel set had more steering lock, closely spaced pedals with a harder to push brake pedal, and tactile paddle shifters. I went back to the controller after giving the Mad Catz a good try in Forza 4.

Overall: 3/5, great for beginners and intermediate racing sim players. Lots of room for improvement in the steering lock, pedal spacing, and needs more brake pedal resistance. It was hard to establish an immersive gaming experience in Forza 4 as I was struggling to get acclimated to the wheel and pedals. I like the G27 and Driving Force GT much more.",Needs to be improved in several areas for better gaming experience,1327795200,2,,

Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, like most newer games based on a classic franchise has decided to move away from the side scroller format of yesteryear, to a 3D ""roaming"" setting. This gives the player more freedom, and gives them a sense of discovery while traversing and exploring their new surroundings. Plus, its kind of expected nowadays.

On top of the new roaming setting, the game series got injected with an extra dose of jaw dropping graphics, that rival most games currently out.

Let me be blunt, and address the elephant in the room. Yes, C:LoS is a clone of the God of War game series. In fact, someone not really paying attention to what you are playing, could be forgiven for thinking it was God of War III. So, if you hate the God of War games, I am pretty sure you will hate this game. Its kind of a given.

There are a few issues I have with this game. The first, and the biggest is the difficulty of the game. Instead of gradually increasing in difficulty, allowing you to get comfortable with the controls, C:LoS just decides to let it rip! Thankfully the first boss is easy, but since hes a tutorial boss, thats to be expected! After that, your next boss is fairly simple, and not too much of a complaint. The third boss however, is extremely difficult! Now, for people who have played God of War, it might be simple enough, but youve had three 6(counting the PSP games) games to adjust to those gameplay mechanics. Its like the developers just expected people to have already played GoW, and they feel they don't need to slowly train you.

Controls of the game, again, an almost exact copy of GoW, so if you are used to it, you will do fine. For me though, I had an issue with the camera controls, or lack there of. This particular issue displeased me even in the GoW games as well. If I want to turn my camera around and look behind my character, I should be allowed to!

Dont get me wrong, im not saying its horrible! It has Patrick Stewart doing a voice in there, how could anyone say anything bad about it?

What I am saying however, is that the game wasn't that enjoyable for me. Some people will love the game to no end. Others? Not so much. It's a flip of the coin really.

However, on the upside, the GoW games are insanely popular, and are playstation exclusives, which means Xbox only owners never had the honor to experience this ground breaking game series. So, since C:LoS is multi-platform, Xbox owners now get a chance to experience something similar to GoW.",Pretty much just a rip off of God of War...,1381968000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

EA does not employ dozens of in-house software engineers to search out all the possible bugs.  It's inefficient.  Rather they release the (inferior) product and then allows the millions of the very talented members of the worldwide  gaming community to find the flaws (which they quickly do) and EA then issues subsequent patches/updates.

Also it appears obvious that this is merely a bare bones base game and EA will aggressively sell DLC, more so than with the Sims 3.

Having said that obviously the price should not be 59.95.  I would put the value closer to $19.99 to 29.99.

Also a lot of lag in the game, a lot of bugs and solo campaign was not as fun as playing with a group.

3.0,False,"10 27, 2005",A9KDAGCZ197UO,B0007GBBHI,E.E.,"First of all, just let me say that the graphics in Black & White 2 are beautiful; everything is rendered with breathtaking detail.  (In fact, on my relatively new system, I had to update my graphics card drivers because there were these big black rectangles over various parts of the land.  The update fortunately fixed this and other problems.)  Second, let me say that graphics definitely do not make a game, and Black & White 2 is no exception.

I was a fan of the original Black & White, and bought BW2 the day it came out in stores.  I took it home and played for a few hours, and, after getting past all of those irritating tutorials (which I think should have definitely included a ""Skip"" button), began to grow frustrated with the very monotonous gameplay.  I'm playing Land 7 now, and haven't experienced any of the excitement of either a god game or a strategy game (BW2's promise was to be the best of both worlds).  Even Black & White's system of winning people by Belief has been removed.  Now you either have to make your town ""Impressive"" enough to make others want to live there, or send out armies to defeat those other towns.  In theory, it sounds like fun, but in reality, it's quite dull.  If you want to be a ""god of peace"", then every level, you have to build a whole bunch of impressive buildings so people will come to live in your town.  If you want to be a ""god of war"", then you have to raise a large army and go capture the enemie's towns.  The army part wouldn't be as bad if the worlds weren't so large and the gameplay was much (MUCH) faster.

Black & White 2 tries to be the master of two genres, but it fails miserably.  If you want to play a god game, find Populous 3.  If you want to play a strategy game, buy Age of Empires or something.  Leave Black & White 2 alone.","Fun, but not perfect",1130371200,11,,

That being said, the game was something I kept going back to play and I enjoyed, but at the same time something I don't think I'll ever choose to play through a second time.  The game is funny and enjoyable when things go well, but there were multiple occasions I was weighing the satisfaction of throwing my controller through the screen vs the replacement costs of the TV and controller.

The conversation games are probably one of the strongest points.  You have to guide your little ""arrow"" through a series of obstacles.  When you hit certain ones the conversation goes well, while the bad ones cause you to say something inappropriate and lose ""love"" from the girl.  Finish the conversation with the heart full and you win.  This is great, the first time you do the conversation.  The forth time, with the exact same dialog, gets really old really fast.  Some of the obstacles you hit make you drunk, so you get sloppier in your controls, making it frustrating as you crash into more bad ones because you're weaving all over the place and lose.  Unlike some of the other games, you have to go through the whole conversation even if there is no chance at all you can win.

A saving grace of the game is that you are given an option (can be disabled if you want the challenge) after three losses that the difficulty ramps down a bit.  There is also a wonderful ""wimp out"" option where you can buy your way out of completing an game.  I used this once for a painful photo shoot in a gay bar.  I found after still losing on the easier mode that I didn't have much fun repeatedly snapping shots of a cartoon willy flopping around on some guy with no clue how to get the ""right"" pictures.

That's another big problem with the game.  It throws you into a lot of games, many are enjoyable, but without much instruction into what you're supposed to do.  I found at one point I was making things harder on myself than needed, because I wasn't aware of a move Larry could do.

When you add in some arbitrary levels that cost you money and make you play other games over and over just to play that game, long load times, and some sharp ramp up of difficulty mid-way through (though again, after 3 losses you can make it easier), there are just a lot of problems.

Here's the catch though, the good stuff out weighs it, if only barely.  I enjoyed playing through the game.  It was long enough, though another girl or two would have been nice.  I'm kind if disappointed there wasn't a sequel; I might have bought it if it were very cheap.  I really did have fun playing this game even with its problems.

The cord from the headset that plugs into the small control box is also messed up like it was pulled threw a hole that was to small or something. I will try one more set be for giving up on these but the issue is still more than I wanted trying to get a new headset.
Right now with the issues I have with this headset I can't give them more than 3 stars. I hate to go threw the return thing but with amazon you know it will be easy and without issue. I order most everything from amazon because they are one of the very few stores anymore that stand behind what they sell and are always ready to help make the defective item return as painless as it can be.
In the end I'm not sure what to think and I hope the new set is better when I get time to do the return on these. If the bass is really this low on this set it will be a total letdown and I wasted my money. I will update after the return and we will see if I got a defective set or this is the way they are as far as the bass but the popping they are having on the left side is an issue with a short of that I'm sure because it also cuts out the audio on that side.",It's OK but bass issues.,1402099200,,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},

Long story short at first with the beautiful graphics and guns its a real joy running around blowing stuff up and playing the missions how you want to play them. But after a while the game makes you play the actual campaign missions to progress to the rest of the map and then it begins to suck. The plot and dialog is painful to sit through. The campaign missions are built in a way the enemy kills you with cheese and a lot of the time you die because of something out of your control. About half way through the game I lost interest.

3.0,False,"11 26, 2006",A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000FZXHNM,A. Gyurisin,"I remember when I was younger I used to love playing the classic arcade version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  In it, you could be any turtle that you wanted, typically you had the panoramic screen, and you and a group of friends would punch buttons till they bled waiting to finally challenge the ultimate Shredder.  It was a game that memories were made of, and it definitely drained your Sunday of all the quarters that you had been saving.  What made this TMNT game a memorable one for me was that you could really immerse yourself in the game and refine your strengths on a certain turtle.  Did you like the bow of Donatello, or did you prefer the dual swords of Leonardo?  The options were yours, and so when I saw ""Justice League Heroes"" released with the opportunity to play all the great characters from the series, I saw my youth days at the arcade spring back into action.  This game developed by Snowblind, did not disappoint (at least not in most areas).

The world is in chaos, and you, the chosen elite that compose the Justice League, have been summoned to stop the evil forces of those like The Key, Brainiac, Queen Bee, and Gorilla Grodd (and even a special appearance by an ultimate favorite near the end!) to name a few.  You fight as Wonder Woman, Batman, Superman, Flash, several Green Lanterns, and so forth to bring down hordes of mindless drones that want nothing but to fight you in a pre-destined way.  This game is a no brainer, by that I mean you can mash the keypad as much as you want and as long as you keep an eye on your health you will be victorious.  There is no deep thought involved with this game because if in the uneventful case of your death, you can still go back and do it all over again without any amazing AI to change it up.  With unlimited continues you can finish this game with several RedBulls and a night off.  I remember the Justice League always having huge challenges with the villains that they fought, but with this game, the challenge was not there.  It was monotonous, it was simple - yet somehow, I was enthralled by it.  This was a simpleton's game.  It was a game that one could come home, not devote so much time to, but thoroughly enjoy a classic ""wham-bam"" arcade style of youth to demolish the haphazardness of your corporate day.  This was a game where you could be a superhero and ""hover"" (not fly) over cities and see villains do what they do best - corrupt the world.

""Justice League Heroes"" completed the task at hand - allow for several hours of game play by a user without needing to step outside the box.  Give them a twist here or there, make the fanboys happy, but don't over extend.  They were not trying to recreate the wheel with this game, just provide for several hours of enjoyable gaming.  The graphics were decent, but nothing to write home about.  The voices could appeal to some, but I couldn't get past Ron Pearlman - Hellboy himself - doing the voice of Batman.  That was a fit that didn't seem to match.  The rest seemed to allow for decent moments.  The controls of the game were ... again - without sounding repetitive - decent.  There was not much discussion or lead-into the reasoning for the speed power-ups and honestly, for me, they were unneeded.  They may have added benefit to my characters, but as I continued to play I found that I just randomly attached them to a character, without any rhyme or reason.  The super features were fun, but grew old over time and I found myself attached to Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern more than the other characters because they had lengthy special abilities which came in handy for a boss or two.  The cut-scenes were enjoyable, which provided for the storyline clich enough to fall into a comic, but convincing enough for this game.  I thought the story kept me going - I wanted to see who was behind all of this, and what techniques would be used to stop him.  I must say that my biggest gripe is that you could go through the game and not unlock all the hidden characters, and you can't really go back and try.  I didn't get to half of the new characters or costumes because I was too busy trying to finish the game.  I didn't see the need for me to buy three extra Green Lantern costumes before I could unlock a character.  That befuddled me.  I also seem to agree with the others making comments about this game with the construct that I could not pick my own heroes for each sequence.  That was a fun element that only seemed to coincide with randomness.  Characters were thrown together with no reasoning and I was forced to helm the stronger of the two.  The AI is decent, but if you just a one player, beware - your other character will just stand on a puddle of flames and die unless you continue to move.  ARG.  Think about it Martian Mindhunter!

Overall, I enjoyed playing this game, but would not find myself behind the helm of it again.  I didn't go to deeply into the other games that could be explored in the game itself, mainly because I only have one controller and a very short time to play these games.  I thought it kept with a classic arcade style of playing, but didn't redefine itself.  I have not played the ""X-Men Legends"" game, but hear that it is modeled very closely.  I also am going to try ""Marvel Alliance"" to see the similarities.  I would suggest this game to friends because of the excitement of helming a mission as Batman or Zatanna, but after three hours of game play your thumbs will be tired and you will see the repetitive nature of the game.  Give it a try, but do not prepare yourself to be blown away.

And, as another reviewer pointed out, you don't go back to the start screen, or have to restart the level, or wait for it to load. But you still have to sit through it every time.

Elsewise, the game is fun enough, if underexplained. There's lots of customization, but no explaination of what any of it does. There's some story tying together the norse and sci-fi aspects, but I'm not sure what it is or how it relates to the game play. The combat is fairly fun; point in a direction and shoot or swing your weapon, no real aiming required. Some of the enemies are fodder, and some are just devastating. Some of the bosses are best killed by targeting various parts of their body in turn. Graphically, it reminds me of Ult Alliance, with a Mass Effect color-scheme. Lots of folks complain about the camera, which takes a little getting used to, but I didn't think it was that bad.

People say you either ""get"" this game or not. I guess I don't. I'll finish it, but I'm sure I won't miss it when it's over.

UPDATE
---------

I think I can honestly say I've given this game a fair shake: after 10+ hours, reaching level 20, and *almost* getting the achievement for ""Die 100 Times""(!). Do the math for how much time I've spent watching the death animation.

I feel like I need to take a class to be good at this game. There's so many unexplained bits and pieces. I've ready forums, FAQ's, game guides, etc, and have had a share of ""D'oh!"" moments, but way too little is explained in game. The phrase ""steep learning curve"" comes to mind.

COMBAT is a huge problem. When it works, it's beatiful. You gracefully pummel, shoot, slide, jump, etc and slaughter the colorful baddies. It's really fun, and it's probably what keeps me playing a game I'm so frustrated with. More often than not, however, it doesn't work. My character won't target the enemy, or at least not quickly enough. Yes, I've continued to target dead enemies while shooting. Sometimes a lone enemy will be running right at me and my guy shoots all around him. The camera also contributes to this, adversely. If you run away from an enemy, you have to turn around, reset the camera, and then attempt attacks. This often takes too long, and you take significant damage. If there are multiple enemies, forget it.

SAVING: When I continue my game the next day, I often seem to start in the middle of a throng of baddies, meaning I die 2 or 3 times just to start the game. I'm trying to be more judicial about when I quit, but it doesn't seem obvious.

Despite the major flaws and frustrations, this game is -somehow- really fun. I just can't figure out how to properly play it.

My thoughts exactly.  Now, this isn't my genre of game, but it IS his, which is why I grabbed it up as a freebie to review with him in mind.  He is really the only person I know who hunts in real life and LOVES these games, which he can play the rest of the year when hunting season is off.

Integration 1 of 5

Guitar Hero is one of the most innovative games/components in video game history.  Who would have thought to create a guitar controller and integrate that with a game to make the player feel like the star?

With that said, this version of guitar hero was somewhat disappointing.  I still like the gameplay which I would rate a 5 of 5.  But what up with the songs?  There are a handful of songs that are decent, but the majority are too hardcore.  Most people do not casually listen to this type of music.  I own a music store and I am telling you the selection on this game is weak.

I own the Wii version of this game as well, however you can not download extra songs and I wanted to get Rock Band on the PS3, so I needed a 2nd Guitar.  The guitars are similar and  feel the same while playing.  I am confused as to why they would have a usb ""dongle"" or adapter with the PS3.  The PS3 has bluetooth for pete's sake.  Charge an extra $10 and give me bluetooth.  That design is poor in my opinion when there are other options.

As far as integration, this is the poorest part of' the entire deal.  The PS2 guitar hero games are not compatible with the PS3.  Well the games are, but the guitars aren't.  Ok, we have a multi-million dollar company that created this game, a multi-billion dollar company who created the system.  Why can we not figure this out.  This is the biggest disappointment to guitar hero fans.

In addition to this integration issue, guitar hero World Tour, set to come out this fall, will feature its own ""Drum set"" as well.  Ok so if you buy Rock Band, you are going to buy a completely different drum set for Guitar hero because they are different as well!  There goes another $200.

I knew ahead of time that this wasn't an official drive from Microsoft, but with the Xbox One coming out soon and the number of games I've been playing on my 360 diminishing, I decided to save a bit of money and choose one of the 3rd party manufactured drives from Amazon.

My experience with the drive has been mixed; first, the drive's casing doesn't fit as smoothly into my 360.  It's slightly bigger, so I had to use a bit of pressure to slide it in to the slot.  Because of the tight fit, it was also extremely difficult to pull back out of the unit and took quite a bit of force, so much that I think the pull tab doesn't work very well anymore.  The original Microsoft drive is able to install and remove without any issues, so this was a bit bothersome.  The other issue i've noticed, that I attribute to the hard drive, is that it's performance seems to vary.  Some games that i've installed like NBA 2K13 feel like they load slower and stutter on occasion, which leads to some of the announcers voices getting out of sync with the game.  I also noticed quite a few stutters and pauses in the Madden 25 demo.  I'm unsure if this is a hard drive issue, but I did end up cracking open the case and sliding the bare drive into the 360 and it appears to be running better, so it might have been an issue with the hard drive fitting properly in my system that I mentioned before.

3.0,True,"02 2, 2010",A2OKJ3H4AT2WN8,B002VL6GAO,FileNotFound,"If you liked Mass Effect 1, buy this game. If you LOVED Mass Effect 1 - maybe this isn't quite for you.

Mass Effect 1 was a great game but had it's flaws. Mass Effect 2 has taken all these flaws away, I do mean all of them, if you can think of a Mass Effect 1 flaw, it's not in 2. Sounds great right? Well not quite. You see it replaced all the original flaws with different flaws.

So lets go over the flaws in Mass Effect 1 in order of annoyance, at least to me.

Mako driving sections:

Mass Effect 1 driving sections were at times really annoying due to the touchy Mako controls and the jagged hard to navigate terrain. It was often times a painful and frustrating experience - but it had it's moments. You have to admit driving into a Geth base firing your cannon at the snipers, mowing down the geth infantry with the machine gun and failing that simply running them over was fun. You cannot deny that you had some good times with the Mako. Had the terrain been easier to navigate, had the Mako been upgradable and had the planets been a little more interesting this would have been a great part of the game.

Instead of doing the above Mass Effect 2 has no Mako. This is not an improvement, because as bad as the Mako was it was not as bad as the new Mineral Scanner. You see what you do with the mineral scanner is you hover it over a 3D representation of the planet while watching a bar graph showing mineral content, when it spikes, you fire a probe. Each probe seems to be able to retrieve no more than 2,000 of any mineral. You need 25,000 of Platinum for many upgrades, it's not a common find. At less than half way through the game I have used at least 200,000 Platinum. It takes at least 15 minutes of flying around and mining planet after planet, refueling and restocking on drones to mine 25k of any mineral. If you though the Mako was boring, you better get something to bite down on because this is going to be painful. Expect to spend at least 4 hours of the '40 hours' of game play staring at the mineral scanner.

Replacing the Mako with the Mineral Scanner was not an improvement.

Inventory System & Itemization:

Mass Effect 1 had a lot of weapons, armor, weapon mods. In fact it had so many items that the inventory which was limited to 150 items became a major annoyance near the end of the game. The massive quantity or armor and weapons did need to be cut down, especially considering that many of then weapons and armor in the later part of the game were useless once you acquired the Specter equivalents. Yes the item system and inventory needed to be streamlined.

Mass Effect 2 did away with it. You now have no inventory. I am half way though the game I have a total of 3 assault rifles, 3 sniper rifles, 1 shotgun and 2 pistols I can use. I have a selection of 3 armors and only thanks to the collectors edition and pre-order code. Your team mates cannot wear new armor except when gaining loyalty. In short your team will look pretty much the same from start to finish. This may not bother you, it annoys me. Jack is walking around practically naked, even in combat missions where you're in hazardous environments. So if you liked customizing your team in expensive armors and weapons - forget it. Not happening. You can change the weapons your team uses but once again, the selection is very very limited and only available at Normandy or at the few Weapon Lockers scattered throughout the game. If you've played Dead Space, the itemization system will seem very similar.

Edit: Having now finished the game, the lack of itemization is a major downer.
There is a total of 5 assault rifles, one of which being a collectors only item.
Total of 6 heavy weapons, one of which is a preorder item.
Total of 2 pistols.
Total of 3 shotguns.
Total of 4 sniper rifles, one of which is a preorder item.
Total of  2 SMGs.

Worse yet you will be forced to be selective about which weapons you attain, at a certain point you will be given the option of getting one of 3 weapons.

The Armor selection is even worse, you do get upgrades to your armor but all in all it will look very much the same from start to finish.

Ammo & Heat:

Mass Effect 1 had infinite ammo. You never ran out. Instead your guns overheated and you had to wait for them to cool down or switch. This was great in that you never had to worry about ammo. But annoying in that it often slowed combat down as you were sitting behind cover waiting for your sniper rifle to cool down.

Now you have ammo in the form of ""universal heat clips"" which would be fine except the heat clips are hardly universal, you can carry a very limited number of them and worse yet they are somewhat rare. This means that during every combat encounter you will run out of ammo for at least one of your guns. Yes, at lest one of your guns, you see these universal clips can't be switched from gun to gun, so you can run out of clips for your sniper rifle but still have plenty for the assault rifle - even though they're universal. You will spend at several seconds after every encounter looking around the area to ensure that you picked up all possible heat clips. It's annoying, it disrupts the flow of the game and it's by no means and improvement over the previous heat system.

Level Design & Feel:

Mass Effect 1 had large levels that you spent a good portion of the time being lost in or backtracking. Sure it was annoying but it made the world feel big, you could run around the Citadel for an hour doing things. Mass Effect 2 citadel can be fully explored in around 5 minutes. There is no backtracking and missions will simply end when objectives are met and you'll be transported back to Normandy. The world feels tiny and is served to you in bite sized pieces. The resulting game feels fragmented and rushed as most missions can be competed in well under 30 minutes.

Most of the depth and detail of Mass Effect 1 has been eliminated. Remember doing side quests to gain access to specific manufacturer licenses to get item upgrades? Remember the multi stage side quests? Remember the main quest forcing you to make difficult decisions on whom to leave behind? Well you best forget all that because none of that is here. Your actions are black and white and you will never need to think hard about your choices. Maybe your choices in Mass Effect 2 will be important in 3, but considering the little effect that Mass Effect 1 had on 2 I very much doubt it. Most of the carry over of the Mass Effect 1 decisions to Mass Effect 2 involve running into old NPC and seeing where they ended up. The NPCs you spared or saved in Mass Effect one at times reward you with tiny 40xp mini quests but other than that serve no value.

Companions:

Your companions have a little more personality to them then in Mass Effect 1, their voice acting and dialogue are better. Yet they all behave very similarly. You will know that you have reached the midpoint of the game because suddenly all your companions will wish to speak to you and ask you to do their very own personal bite sized side quest. After this side quest they'll be your new best friend, even your former team mates like Garrius will suddenly become ""Loyal"" as if he was not loyal before. The sudden transition from not loyal to loyal feels extremely artificial and forced. Mass Effect 1 simply did it better.

Quests:

There are certainly fewer side quests and they are for the most part far shorter. There are no more multi stage side quests and the sidequests that you do seemingly have very little impact on the game and do not force you to make any choices like they did in Mass Effect 1. It's more of the land, kill everyone, go back to Normandy variety. Sure it's faster but in the end it gets very repetitive due to the fact that your team simply doesn't seem to change due to the lack of variety of weapons, armor and skills.

Plot & Ending:

The plot and ending of Mass Effect 2 are terrible. I do not know why nobody else seems to be addressing this, maybe nobody noticed because the companions are far more interesting than the main story. Yet as fascinating as your companions are, it's odd that none of them notice how dull their main quest is. There is no villain, there is no struggle, there is no confrontation, there is no grand finale, and there is no climax beyond ""the suicide mission"". Your victory will feel hollow no matter what you do, no matter who dies or who survives. You will not defeat anyone specific like you did in Mass Effect 1. Your actions throughout the game and your final choices seem far less vital never mind that the final mission is far shorter and less impressive than just about any major stage of Mass Effect 1. The confrontation with Saren in Mass Effect 1 was possibly one of the best with any RPG villain and your ability to actually avoid fighting him was a very unique option. No such things here, if it moves, shoot it.

Conclusion:

This is still a very good game, but it's not better than Mass Effect 1, at least not in my opinion. In fact I feel that it's a far more shallow less involving and far less replayable game than Mass Effect 1. The Mass Effect 2 companions may be better but the rest of the world is much more lifeless and the rest of the characters that do not join you are far less memorable than those in Mass Effect 1. So while I certainly would suggest anyone who played Mass Effect 1 to buy 2, don't expect it to be an upgrade or more of the same. You may like it more, you may like it less. It all depends on what you are looking for.

Having finished the game I would urge anyone to wait for the GOTY edition or whatever they will release in a year or so that will include DLCs, more weapons or missions - anything to add depth to this ankle deep kiddie pool of an RPG.","A few steps forward, a few steps back.",1265068800,42,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First things first: The graphics engine is awesome. This is easily the most beautiful game world ever created. This is true for indoor scenarios, but the engine is especially good with tropical outdoor scenarios.

Unfortunately, the save-game system is the worst I have encountered in a long time. Not only is your only option to auto-save at check points (which are few and far between and also inconsistant), but the game sometimes even ends up saving just before you get hit by a bullet. And you guessed it: Once you load the game, the bullet is right there again, hitting you in the face. Argh! (I read that there is a bug that fixes this problem, but I have not seen that available anywhere... V1.1 seems to have the same problem...)

Can it be so hard to create a FPS game that is fun to play, simply by allowing me to progress through the game smoothly? This is now the second game within a very short period of time that I bought an UbiSoft game that was truely fantastic, but was made completely frustrating and useless by its save-game feature (XIII being the other).

But perhaps I am asking too much if I expect some fun to come in the same box as great graphics...

PS: I have now modified the game myself, adding a quick-save key (which can be done using configuration files and some minor scripting). This makes the game a little better. However, once I did this, I realized that there are many other things wrong with this game. I can not count the number of times where I entered a room and was immediately killed without even knowing what hit me. I often had to enter the same room 4 or 5 times before I could even figure out what was going on!

At other times, I would have to approach the same enemy multiple times and even though I knew what was coming and already aimed at the right spot before things happened, I was still killed again and again. How one would get through these scenes without a save game feature is completely beyond me. Sure, I did not play on the easiest setting, but still! I have played through all of Doom 3 without having been killed once where I thought it wasn't my own fault. In Far Cry, this happend all the time!

And then there were times where the level design was just so sloppy that I could not move on. A few times I tried to swim through a pond, just to realize that I could not get out of it because the banks were to steep. At other times, I set off a huge explosion that threw crates around so they would block the next door, and I could not move them out of the way. Now just imagine you die because of that kind of nosense and there is no save feature!

At other times, I tried to shoot mosters with a clear line of sight, but the collision detection is so sloppy that I kept firing into an invisible wall. As soon as I moved a few pixels though, the monster would kill me before I was able to fire off another shot (and it takes several shots to kill those monsters). I am not sure why this is such a problem?!? It seems that the FarCry developers can do perfect per-pixel lighting, but on the other hand, they can not even do rough per-vertex collision detection and instead use a bounding box? Hard to believe, but for a good number of on-screen objects, this seems to be the case.

This game is a good example for a game that sells because of its graphics. The graphics are awesome, but the rest of the game is a disaster! Put a different/average graphics front end on this, and people would hate this game! Game design wise, this is completely unacceptable. Still, the graphics are worth seeing, especially outdoor scenarios. You can see that in the free demos though.",Awesome Graphics Demo...,1085875200,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Being able to replay or rewrite pivotal moments in Wrestlemania history is cool, and the video footage of classic Wrestlemania matches, as well as the superstars trash-talk videos before the events, is a feast of nostalgia. The roster and entrances are also a satisfying trip back to the good old days. However, once you get into the gameplay it has absolutely no depth, and leaves you longing for so much more. Excuses have been made for the lack of a career mode, like the fact that most of these wrestlers are now retired. But I have not heard a valid excuse. The career does not have to take place today. If you can rewrite history on the classic matches, why not with your favorite classic wrestler's career? The roster will bring back a lot of great memories for any long time fan, but there are still some glaring ommissions, such as Macho Man Randy Savage or Mick Foley (in any of his personas), or ANY, yes ANY of the divas either as wrestler or manager, like Sensational Sherry, Elizabeth, or Chyna (there are no female wrestlers at all). The good news is there are a lot of names on the roster, and instead of only getting the most popular stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair you also get names like Brutus The Barber Beefcake and Big Bossman (both of whom I was delighted to see).

Though in many ways it seems a mishmash of other RTS games, it has a couple twists to it that make it more of its own game.

The game takes place in an epic fantasy land. There is a vast campaign mode that covers the many different races present in the game. The sides in the war are defined both by what race a group is and what affiliation they hold. Races in the game include Humans, Drauga (a warlike tribal race similar in some ways to orcs), Gauri (a stone-based race similar in theory to Dwarves but influenced more by Sumerian culture), Haroun (nature-worshipping elves), Shadows (demons and their worshippers), and the Undead. Each race has a couple different affiliations available, as well. Royalists get bonuses in combat. Nationalists have bonuses in more supply-related areas. Council followers get a reduction to structure costs. Ceyah, or exiles, can entrench and run faster to support their guerilla warfare. The Fallen - the dark forces that seek to invade the world - can see farther and are more resilient than the other groups.

The races have similarities and differences. All groups use the same basic formula for units and buildings; both are reminiscent of Lord of the Rings: The Battle For Middle Earth's particular style. Buildings are constructed in settlements - towns or cities that can only be built on certain spots. These settlements have a limit to the number of structures they can hold, which necessitates upgrading. Upgrading also increases the strength of the city's walls. Building structures allows you to access new technologies and new unit types. Units are grouped into ""companies"" of 4 to 8 units. Unit types include melee soldiers like swordsmen and pikemen, ranged units like archers, and support units like catapults, engineers, healers, and mages. Aside from the homogenous regular companies, it is also possible to create custom companies that mix and match several unit groups.  Companies are led either by a generic captain or a hero. Heroes give bonuses to the units they command, and can also gain experience from combat. In non-Campaign missions, the number of heroes can be set and all are available from the start to be attached to a unit.

Resources come in two varities: Gold, which can be stockpiled, and miscellaneous materials like wood, iron, and stone that are done with a different mechanic. Both types are generated by certain buildings. Gold is used to pay directly for units. Materials, however, are necessary to keep them. For example, training a cavalry company costs gold and wood. For the gold, you can simply wait until you have the amount that you need. Wood, on the other hand, will be generated in a certain amount by buildings like sawmills. Non-upgraded sawmills generate 6 wood. A lancer unit costs 4 wood. So basically as long as that company is alive it will consume 4 of the 6 wood units generated by a sawmill. Resource collectors can be built either in towns or on resource deposits outside of towns. Inside of towns, resource collecting buildings can either be upgraded to make more of their resource, or upgraded to markets to get gold at a slight cost to the resource. Which to do - keeping in mind the limited space in each town - is an important tactical decision.

Combat consists of companies clashing against each other. The front line will engage first, with the leader providing support. When the front line is destroyed, the leader will come under attack. There are several options for combat. Formation can be changed, basically trading speed for power or vice versa. Morale can falter in dire circumstances, causing the unit to rout until it recovers. There are also strengths and weaknesses for each unit; for example, cavalry can easily ride down archers. The other main thing about combat is supply areas. This is an area around towns and outposts where friendly units can heal and replenish their lost members. It is better to fight close to your towns and outposts so that you can get this bonus, or you can go there to recover after a battle. Furthermore, the maps are littered with important sites; settlement points where new towns can be built (once the point's monster inhabitants are removed), creature lairs and bandit camps that can be attacked and destroyed for gold, for research bonuses, and to ensure safe passage through the wilderness, and resource points where engineers can construct mines.

As a whole, the gameplay works pretty well. While it is complex, the nuances and options available make the experience pretty interesting. I think the main problem is pacing - the game starts to slow down once you go through your starting gold, and apart from finding gold deposits out in the wilderness there's not a lot you can do to speed it up. The races do have their own little unique touches despite keeping the same basic formula.

The graphics in this game are reminiscent of Warcraft 3, though not as cartoony. The game uses the same style and the same ""animated head in portrait"" that WC3 uses. Overall, they're pretty good, and the colors are bright and identifiable to avoid confusion during play. There's not a lot that's really spectacular about them - I wouldn't say that they're great by any means - but they do the job and they look pretty nice too. The sound is about the same - it's good, but not great. It's serviceable, if anything. The music is an exception, as the composition is really nice. The voice acting is bland, and tends to be over-enunciated, but doesn't have a lot of active problems.

As a whole, this game is pretty good. It's not groundbreaking, and it's not fantastic in any particular field, but it's a pretty solid package. It's worth a look if you're a fan of either Warcraft III or Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth, but don't expect anything extraordinary.

Manhunt 2 is more like murder for some other reason that isn't as interesting. I would still recommend this game to anyone who loves to murder endless cartoon characters on the TV.  Now where the heck is Manhunt 3 already? They are pushing the boundaries of games every day. We need an awesome ultra-violent return to this series.

So I was prepared to really like its sequel, Dreamfall. However, after investing 15 hours into it, I reluctantly gave up. Not that there's a problem with the story. Though it's slow moving it is very interesting. The game is not terribly puzzle oriented, which is all right with me. The voice acting is very good, as are the music and sound effects. And the graphics are simply amazing. My problems were twofold. One, I could never get used to the character movement. For some reason the game's creators decided to abandon the pleasant, easy interface of The Longest Journey in favor of an awkward keyboard/mouse combination. My biggest gripe, though, is that arcade combat sequences are present throughout the game (at least the part I played). Some people might like them but I simply despise them.

However I plugged away at it and now that I have the gadgets, especially the sonic goggles allowing me to see through walls, it reminds me of Batman Arkham City. I love sneaking around and you take out the lights, just like in Thief, and with stealth you take everybody out. Very fun.

Cons - if your head shot is not precise, they return fire pretty easy and kill you. Let me be clear, I have for sure shot the guy from about 5 feet away, pretty close to in the head but one time he had a helmet on and was like ""huh?"" and he turned around and killed me. That felt pretty unrealistic. From that range taking a bullet to the head, even with protection should still knock him out. Anyway it is a small gripe and doesn't happen to often.

UPDATE: I originally gave this 5 stars but now only 3, because in this game you can sneak up, shoot somebody in the back 3x very quickly and they just turn around and return fire, alert their friends and your cover is blown. I'm not kidding I shot a guy 9 times from 2 feet away before he finally went down.

The art style is unique enough, but I just couldn't get past the bland, repetitive combat, and the holier than thou storyline. I'm not religious in the slightest and felt like this was over the top. Music was interesting, and back to the combat, you can't die in the game, even for boss battles. To revive yourself, you just press L1/R1 and X/ [] buttons. The thing is, even on my brand new PS3 controller, 30% of the buttons pressed wouldn't register during these moments in the game where you have to spam it to be revived. Maybe I'm doing it wrong or whatever, but they could have easily used a simpler 1-2 button combination and I shouldn't have to worry about whether it's going to work or not far past a checkpoint or at a boss encounter.

I did like watching the scenes throughout the game, it was very interesting. It was also cool when you got to help the characters from the movies and the other games.  But it was lacking a lot of things.

  First of all the battles got kind of repetitive after a while, you couldn't even come close to getting all the characters abilities w/out battling around for a long time. There also should have been something more with evil mode than just fighting battles, it got pretty boring.

However, once you reach Level 60 (the max level) with a character, the game's level of fun starts to readily decline. Frankly, there's just not enough to do. The only reason I'm ever even tempted to play with a Level 60 character any more is to try to kill enough enemies to find an item that I can sell in the game's real-money auction house. Even that is a joke, though, because nothing sells there - and the few things that do sell are sold for so cheap that no one makes money besides Blizzard.

The DRM is probably the most annoying part of this game. I hate the fact that I have to always be online. I hate it, because it means that if Blizzard has to do server maintenance, or Blizzard's servers crash, or a myriad of other things, then I can't play the game that I paid an inflated $60 for. To me, that is ridiculous.

I still think the game is worth buying, especially for casual gamers like me. There are at least 50-100 hours of fun in this game, which for me is quite good.

If you liked it, you'll tell others and they'll buy it...If you didn't like it, you'll also tell others and unsold copies die on the shelves. Being relatively new to the PS3, my FPS benchmark is Half-Life 2. The game was compelling, challenging and it had finely-tuned controls. It was such a satisfying game experience that I was disappointed when the game finally ended. For me, Killzone 2 is almost the opposite. It is such a MADDENING game, that I would shove it down the throats of those who released it on the market if I ever met them!

It's a shame that so many people put so many man-hours into the development of this much-hyped game for it to come up short, primarily because of faulty controls...It's the ONE thing you'd think they'd get RIGHT on an FPS after years of development. Not so. In fact, SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE FIRED at Guerilla Games! I've never screamed so many 4-letter words at an inanimate object before in my life...But now my HDTV has skid marks on it from all of the expletives I've yelled at it during this half-baked game!  First, the GOOD:

1) This game has a good intro movie to clue everyone in who missed KZ1 (including me).

2) The voice acting is crisp and clear, although it's hard to say who was screaming more profanities per hour: me or the characters. Seriously...I'm an adult and I know this is a ""war"", but the frequency of profanities is so overdone you'll probably just MUTE the sound during cut scenes. On the lighter side, there's a bizarre mix of ""Earthling"" accents spoken by various characters...Including a Helghast informing Radec near the end of the game that ""Security identified a breach at the main gate"" with the thickest British accent you're likely to hear outside of Liverpool. The fact that you're supposed to be in an extrasolar location (Alpha Centauri system) has to elicit a chuckle.

3) Visually, it's a stunning game...But I can say that about pretty much every game we've played on our PS3 in the 3 months we've had it. Outstanding graphics are more of the NORM now and don't make a 5-star game all by itself.

I really do try to get into a game, but now for some things that make you go, ""Huh?""

1) The setting is ""hundreds of years in the future"", OK? So the bad guy steals ""a nuclear weapon"" and needs the launch codes to explode it...LOL. Are you kidding me?? It's hard enough believing that pistols, machine guns and grenades are still being used as primary weapons on the battlefield this far ahead...But the most sinister future weapon Guerilla can come up with is 20th century nuclear weapons technology? Furthermore, you have a major boss battle in a building that should've been completely leveled after one of these weapons is detonated. Again, LOL...

2) The chief military villain has the ability to ""teleport"" himself at will. Apparently, he's the only one with this technology. Did he discover it all by himself or wouldn't the scientists who developed it also be teleporting around? Wouldn't a mutinous underling kill him in his sleep to steal the mysterious cloaking ability and rule the world? And why isn't this man ruling the world now...I mean, he still WORKS FOR SOMEONE ELSE! You'll just shake your head and wonder HOW something like this even found its way into the game.

3) You can ONLY carry ONE weapon at a time (sorry, pistol/knife don't count)...WHY? In Half-Life 2, one of the pure enjoyments is being able to instantly select from a plethora of enemy-busting weapons! Realistic? No...But KZ2's weaponry is far from realistic and being confined to just one of them at a time significantly reduces the fun factor. Add to that the extreme frustration you repeatedly feel when you're in the heat of battle and you need (or want) to change weapons. Once you find a new one, which normally isn't a problem, you have to approach the weapon and hold the ""square"" button. Pretty easy, except when you're taking heavy fire or have an enemy rushing you...Hold the button a little too long and you pick up the new weapon, then drop it and pick up the old weapon again. Don't hold the button for long enough and you don't even pick up the new weapon before running for cover. Who came up with THIS moronic design?

4) While we're on the subject of weapons, this game has the most AWFUL weaponry of any game I've ever played, even those not on the PS3. The grenade launcher is pretty much useless. How realistic is THAT? Most of the enemy's machine guns are near worthless, unless they're shooting them AT YOU! Shoot any machine gun for more than 1 sec and you're soon shooting over the enemy's head...So you have to constantly stop firing while they never stop firing!?! However, walk around in the EXO scene and you're pretty much in god mode, virtually indestructible. Then in the cruiser scene, you can barely draw a bead on an enemy because for 30 full minutes, the ship is violently shaking every few seconds like it just split in two. It's like different teams developed different scenes and then patched them together in the final hour of development...

5) The field of view and turning around speed are ridiculous! For example, fighting the ATAC alone. It's like Sev's field of view is 90 deg (45 deg right, 45 deg left). For much of the time you can't even see the boss shooting at you, and by the time you turn halfway around to target him, you're shot dead. If anyone truly took 3 sec to turn around on a battlefield, they'd be the first casualty.

6) Finally, the end boss battle is just a JOKE. Use grenades, SMGs, shotties, sniper rifles, even missle launchers with little immediate effect. Get touched by a knife and you're dead. GEE, what fun! Plus you have a ""helper"" who is basically there for the enemy's target practice, not to help you out. And after you ""win"", your character hardly feels like a hero. Perhaps that's some political commentary on war itself...But it's not the kind of feeling I want after plunking down $60 and putting several hours into gameplay. If I wanted to feel like a loser, I'd watch the nightly news every night instead of playing a video game as a temporary escape from reality! Get it, Guerilla?

I'll qualify my review saying it was the ""pre-patch"" version, since a patch was released just 7 DAYS after the game's freakin release date...Supposedly to address, in large part, controller issues. Remember what I said earlier about how someone needs to be fired at Guerilla Games? I realize this may seem weird and inconsistent, but with all of its many shortcomings, I still give KZ2 3 out of 5 stars. There's enough to really get wrapped up in so you can overlook the frustrations that appear in certain phases of the game.

But I tell you, there are times that will have you nearly throwing your controller at the screen or your PS3 out the window!

RELOAD OFTEN.  The enemies take a rediculous
amount of punishment before they croak.  I basically
used the one weapon which fires three short bursts,
one to knock off the helmet (if he's wearing one),
and two more for a facial.  Unless it's an explosive
weapon, the others are useless unless you want to
receive major damage in the process.  There's very
little time to take a breather, so be ready to do a

The good is simple, everything you liked about Arkham City as far as game play goes, is back in full force and no one should be disappointed. How it all gels together though is to be desired.
Now for the bad:

Story:

Now, my favourite aspect of a game's story is the level of urgency (hence why Bioshock 1 is my least favourite of the 3 and why I just never got into the Last of Us (and probably wouldn't care much for 2 souls)). I don't feel the initial rush I felt in either Asylum or City. Man, those games were great at the beginning, so immersive. This one left me a bit in the cold (HA! Cause it's winter...). The story seemed hap hazard, which makes sense for a more open world game. This game, more unlike the other two, wants to be an open world game where you are Batman doing whatever Batman has to do, confronting a bunch of villains a night. I prefer stories where the city is actually at stake, rather than my own life (or rather, Batman's life). This game is more personal and more akin to an open world game like Skyrim than a metroid vania type game with a singular story.

I absolutely LOVED it in City, when Hugo Strange executed his protocol and you had no choice but to follow the story line. And of course you (well, I) would, because there is no way Batman would go around beating some thugs up or trying to capture Hush when there are helicopters shooting bombs on everyone. That rush was insane. And yes, it was crafted that way. The game wanted me stop strange at that moment. In Arkham Origins, there is a scene where people are held hostage and batman tells Alfred he has to handle it first before doing anything else. There was great immediacy. But then I realized I didn't have to help right away. I could scan some tagged buildings or take out one of Enigma's networks. Even while on the actual mission, I can just do whatever I want when I want to.

A copy paste of Arkham City with focus on open world becomes tedious

My complaints are on this game having a different intention than the previous where it is trying to be more of a grand theft auto game. HOWEVER, if it is to have different intentions, then why is it a copy paste of the other games? Especially City. This angers me to no end. Yes, I agree, the riddler trophies in City may have been tedious, but I didn't see it that way then. I needed this game to see it, and you know why? Because it's the same thing. Everything has been copy pasted. Instead of Zsaz making you travel to a location, you have Anarky. Instead of riddler trophies, you have data packs (Which make no sense story wise), instead of riddler signs that only get revealed with detective vision (my personal favourite from Azylum), you have Anarcky tags (why would he use invisible ink to tag big buildings to show that he's an activist, isn't that counter intuitive?), instead of Venom containers, you have Black Mask drug containers (I think), DeadShot is still just a sidequest like before (after all that marketing, really?), instead of TIGER Cameras, you have Riddler network servers/modems/antennas and the list goes on. And it's not only that, but the city itself is a copy paste. Arkham City taught us that a section of gotham was closed off to make the prison, but this game tells us that it was all of the upper half. How does that make any sense? Wasn't it boarded up by a giant wall? Wouldnt the upper half of this game's city extend beyond the Arkham City map? I am realizing just how great the island of Arkham Azylum was. There were no invisible walls; you simply could not get beyond the island. It was its own little open world with urgency that could not be avoided and you never felt like you were missing out on a bigger city or other areas, and you never noticed the limitations of having it on that island because everything was made accessible.

Less attention to the city itself

My other big negative point is how this city feels less alive than Arkham City. It made sense to just have thugs around Arkham City, since the city was all prisoners. But Arkham Origins has the same thing and yet, this isn't a prison. The theme made the constancy of thugs and villains make sense, but here is feels shallow and more like a copy paste of what was found in City. Arkham City had amazing details. Remember that Museum? Now contrast that with Penguin's ship. What was ""penguin"" about it? What made the casino so unique that it could only exist in Batman's world? I remember complaining a bit that Arkham City didn't have much detail in the city (all buildings, stairways, windows looked the same), but the chaos splatterred all over it (like riddler marks on the Church's gargoyles and Two Face wrecking half of the court house and Joker adding clowns all over the steel mill) makes that game jump leaps and bounds over Arkham Origins. It just doesnt feel lived in, by its villains or its people.

I remember promising Freeze to find his wife and finding her, randomly as I was investigating around. She was held captive by the Joker's thugs. I went to see freeze and he got there by creating an ice bridge over the water which you could now use. And then, when you go back to the location, you can see him reunited with her AND scan them to answer a riddle. Sure, that last part makes no sense, but it was just an extra reward for seeing where the game would go with that extra mission (which at first didn't feel like a mission since it was truly optional). Things like this made the gaming experience feel so much more organic instead of by  the numbers, which is what this game feels like. It wants to include everything City had, making sure you have enough things to do, and makes it dull. I already played City, 2.5 times, I don't need to play it again. So there you go, this is my true criticism.

Gameplay changes

As a technical standpoint, I have no objections now that I fixed my settings (the game keeps going back to default physcs which makes my game so slow, and I didn't know). The framerate is good and the fighitng is better than ever. I like how hard it is now. I have to strange my strategy and be more defensive. I actually gain my first special by just blocking. And I HAVE to figure out how to dodge knives. They always mess me up. In City, I could just jump over the guy, but not anymore. The AI is very agressive and it feels great now that my framerate is good. As far as graphics, it just looks like City, but less lived in. Batman looks great though. I have loved all his costumes so far. And I like Deathstroke's costume too, I like all the costumes. I never minded any of the character interpretations in the batman games.

Now onto the good...

While I complain about the writing, I must admit that the last 2 hours are probably the best in any Batman game. It is very batman like and has that villain interaction we always love. I did not expect it and it makes a nice bow on the series. Hopefully that isn't too much of a spoiler. But man, that urgency finally comes full force, way better than any of the previous ones. I guess it took a while for this game to get to me, but it did.

So, after liking this game in the end, what about New Game Plus?

Well, remember I said this game makes me look like a manic depressive... I was so pumped that I wanted more and since I had not found all the riddler stuff and was slowly getting into it (I did not care to investigate his base till late in the game and then found it interesting), I did the same that I did in City and started new game plus. In Arkham City, I would just replay the game ad when I would see something that I couldn't access before, I would then have the gadgets to access these parts. It didn't matter much in Azylum since the map was smaller but back tracking in City just for riddler trophies would have been a bit much.

BUT GUESS WHAT: new game plus DOES NOT give you all your gadgets. You have all your gadget upgrades but not your gadgets. So you unlock the gadgets just as you did in the original capaign and then you have the upgrades already available as soon as you get the gadgets. But you still start the game the very same way. So now new game plus seems much less inticing, especially since there are some sidequests I don't care to redo (the way the Bane sidequest in City was handled was pretty genius, there is no ingenuit here). So yeah, the story and writing is a plus to this series (the great finale) and so are the better boss fights. But everything else is inferior to Arkham City, too bad. Dammit, now I regret preordering it, especially with all the bugs on PC. That will teach me (still preordering Bioshock games though, the Ken Levine places PC first, awesome).

It takes place in the submersed city of Rapture, driven by industry and art and a love of freedom, led by idealists and dreamers.  It is also severely messed up, and the effects of hedonistic life and elitism stack up until something terrible tears apart their hidden Eden.  Science that had once considered itself unshackled from petty morality has gone haywire, and the decadence of a society that existed for society's sake has fallen apart.  With such a fantastic story at the foundation, Bioshock should be one of the greatest games ever, right?

Well, no.  It certainly is fun to play through once, and that is an endeavor I would recommend once you've played through a number of better games.  When this game was in production a number of promises were made -- not the least of which was the ""-shock"" moniker in the title.  This is supposed to be a spiritual successor to the frightening System Shock series, which may be old and clunky, but were classics.  They were games that frightened me immensely, and I was looking forward to being scared silly in the halls of Rapture.  Instead, the ride was sort of dull.

The art is amazing, but the story degenerates as it goes.  The one truly brilliant twist comes too soon in the game, and the philosophy of the moment is lost when your character just ignores its implications and continues on with his life without question.  I would recommend that everybody experience that twist, but YouTube will get you there in a tenth the time and with nearly none of the disappointment.

The real problem is that there just isn't any complexity to this game.  There were supposed to be complex moral quandaries, but the reward for being good is better than that of being evil, and with only two endings that you determine without consciously knowing it, the game just doesn't have a conscience.  You are a character in a game, and Bioshock lets you know it over and over again.  Throw in the fact that by the end of the game pretty much everyone who has ever played will have roughly the same character (no actual role-playing here), and you have a disappointingly formulaic game that should have been the best in years.

Still, I would recommend the game if you can get it used or if you have nothing else to play; but pretty much anything else will yield more fun than this one.",Should Have Been a Classic...,1239667200,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I don't care so much about light sourcing or smoke effects in the games I play; I want games that are well-polished and fun to play.  Too many PS/2 games are relying on good graphics to carry the day.
Unfortunately, the Wipeout Fusion designers seem to have focused more on the dust and smoke and less on the game itself.
The graphics are OK.  The resolution is noticeably better than in the PSone (of course), but there are noticeable popup effects and framerate problems as well.  (In bad cases I've seen the framerate slow to what appears to be less than 5 frames a second.  Wip3out at its worst was better than this.)
The gameplay itself also has significant problems.  The first noticable issue is that it's tough to compare the different ships--unlike the first two games, each ship is on a separate screen and the various statistics aren't directly comparable.  Not a huge problem, but it struck me right away as something easily fixable but quite annoying... especially as some of the more advanced ship descriptions are less than helpful.
There are also some big clipping problems.  I've gotten my ship blown through walls, mountains, rocks, you name it. The game recovers cleanly, and sometimes it's even an advantage (depending on where you can be placed back onto the track) but again, it's annoying.  I can't recall this sort of problem ever happenign in Wipeout XL/3...  Maybe the designers considered this to be a feature, but I haven't found it so, especially as the ship often ends up in very strange places and can even get trapped.
Some of the new weapons exacerbate the clipping issues.  One of them (gravity bomb) gives your ship a high acceleration before stopping it dead, and the high acceleration causes a lot of the clipping issues.  (It also has a very large area of effect, which I can't say is a feature either.)
Another annoying feature is that the CPU ships have access to all the weapons, including the ones that they weren't allowed to use in Wipeout XL/Wip3out.  I've lost many races because five or six trailing enemy ships decided to release Quake at the same time, and there's no defence; you lose.  Ditto with Gravity Bomb or some of the other area-effect weapons.  The enemy ships also have eyes in the back of their heads, as they're amazingly skilled at blocking your ship.
None of this would matter so much except for the structure of the league races, where losing one race can make all the difference between earning an overall first place finish and not--and you have to come in first to advance.  I'm also not that thrilled with the whole credit system for upgrading ships, as it just requires playing the league series over and over and over and over...blah.
Finally...it just doesn't feel anything like the originals.  The physics are strikingly different; it's almost a totally different game than the first two.  I also miss the Designers Republic influence on the game, and I'm totally missing the point about the big heads (er, sorry,pilots), as there's no real personality behind them.  And why would anyone find looking at preliminary sketches of the artwork interesting?  That's a pretty crummy extra.
In short: it feels about 3/4 finished.  I hate to judge it against the first two, because of course it's allowed to be its own game, but I'd give it about 50% for the effort. They should've called it something other than Wipeout, and really finished the game before releasing it.","sigh, what a shame...",1025568000,17,,

Little big planet is a platforming game centered around a small puppet called sackboy. The object is just like any other platforming game out there, you get from one end of the level to the other without dying too many times all the while you collect different things throughout the level, in this case bubbles or stickers.

I'll be completely honest and tell you that I typically don't play many platform style game simply because I find them to be minimalistic and simple at best where I strive for a game that has a little more too it such as an RPG style game. This game was no different, in fact I found it to be less desirable than a normal platformer. The biggest issue I had with this game was there really was no story at all, I mean there was sackboy running around these beautiful yet oddly grotesque levels(more on that later) but really nothing else. This was an issue for me because generally because platforers typically struggle to keep my attention, I rely heavily on their storyline to keep me interested and playing the game.
Furthermore, the controls themselves were too simplistic. There really was only the ability to move, jump and grab things it other then that, there was nothing. I wished there had been the ability to fight enemies or even the ability to double jump would have been a welcome inclusion.

While, I admit, I was particularly fond of this game I also must say there were a couple things that I really DID like. For one, the levels were very well done. They had a style that was completely unique with the perfect blend of beauty and grotesque-ness that kept me in awe. Going along with that, everything looks surprisingly real (for lack of a better term). I was very impressed with amount of artistry that went into designing these levels.
Another thing that I will concede to being relatively interesting was the ability to change sackboy. Between all the costumes, stickers, colors, stamps, etc that you can get, you really have an unlimited amount of ways that you can customize sackboy and your pod which, while it was a rather minuscule part of the game for me, definitely have the game a unique aspect that I havnt seen anywhere else.

Overall, this game is not one that I would buy again for myself...so why did I give it a 3 star rating? Well the reason happened as I came home from work one night. I walk up my stairs to find my wife about a foot from the tv playing littlebigplanet. I was surprised because she is notoriously picky when it comes to playing games of any type and yet she was having an absolute blast. I was further impressed when my younger cousins, nieces, and nephews came over and they all really enjoyed it. It seemed the only people who didn't enjoy this game were those who tend to consider themselves to be more than a casual gamer. So there you have it, for a more experienced gamer who likes strategy, story, skill, immersion in the game, etc I really would recommend NOT buying this game.

SH 5 follows Alex Shepard, as he traverses Sheperds Hill, his hometown, and then Silent Hill, searching for his little brother, who seemed to be in trouble in a dream he had. His father has also vanished and his mother is a near catatonic wreck. The story actually bears quite a few similarities to the movie, in the way the main character keeps chasing his brother, only to lose him at the last moment. Sheperds Hill tries to appear normal, but is overrun with smoke breathing zombies and skinless hounds, not to mention the canonical roads that vanish.

The character attempts to be intelligent, planning to find his brother and get the hell out of town, rather than ""figure this out,"" but is bogged down by the limitations of a classical adventure game. He has to break through boarded doors with a fire ax, rather than a hammer that has to be found somewhere among the 436 tool boxes scattered throughout town. The few other players in town taht retain their wits can't bring themselves to flee the godforsaken place, and I hope sincerly that its explained at least to some degree.

Significant Improvements: The combat system is a lot more fluid and beliavable. You can dodge and duck out of the way, and you now have a targeting cursor. Enemies has identifiable weakness and strength to certain weapons, and you can use the terrain to somewhat of an advantage, though most veterans still use the time honored tradition of run the heck away.

Enemies no longer respawn, or spawn far less frequently, and there are fewer corridors of death where you can get boxed in and not be able to fight your way out.

God bless them, but pick up items now glow with a glossy sheen, not a flare in the darkness, but you can now see interactive items, rather than relying on your character turning his head.

Same Ol, Same Ol: Searching for that one piece of inventory, and being unable to kick open or shoulder through a door. One of the few things Condemned nailed perfectly.

Drawbacks: Not enough scary. There are quite a few jumps, and some creepy points, but not enough punch like there was in SH 1 and 2. The writers seem to think that darker=scarier. WRONG. However, they've applied lessons learned, so I can forgive them this.

Overall: Decent though not impressive graphics, a significantly improved h2h combat system, good voice acting, attempts at intelligent main character behavior, and a above average story thats been fleshed out more make this a rent-to-own, though I would rent initially unless you're an achivement or ending hound like myself.

My goal in games is to enter a different world, and enjoy it.  I'm not into developing level 100 warriors.  I want to walk around, solve some quests or adventures, experience some beauty, have a few laughs.  Grim Fandango, also an old game, was a 10 out of 10, for me.  (Psychonauts was my favorite game of all time.)

I only played this game for an hour.  The graphics were very nice, though even with my ATI Radio 9800 PRO, the characters had a lot of jaggies.  But the scenes were gorgeously painted.

1-if you are a RE fan, and looking forward for another RE that stands up for the series, you will be hugely disappointed of RE6 because this game is not what you used to play in RE 1,2,3 or even 4.

Saints Row 3 was getting pretty out there from a game-play and story angle.  A lot of people complained that it was too vulgar and whacky and had lost touch with it's roots.  I don't know that that's as correct as the developer was just trying to keep things from getting stale.

Saints Row IV continues down the whacky offshoot and heads straight toward insanity.  It's not that I mind that or get offended or something it's just that it takes away from the experience.  It might be trite to say that you can get attached to characters in a game but I liked what the first two Saints Rows offered in story line.  This story reminds me a lot of Duke Nukem'.  It seems to strive for shock factor or just plain audacity instead of being compelling.

The other major complaint is game-play.  The concept or jumping and having super powers to grab orbs (oops Data Clusters) seems ripped straight from Crackdown.  I also liked the Crackdown series but I wasn't expecting that with this game.  They reference that they are ripping off other games but I don't think that making light of it helps any.

1)  It is a console port, and there was very little care put into making the PC version a real PC version.  It has a pretty bad case of Consolitis.  Even the incremental saves don't make much sense.

2)  Gameplay is hampered with all sorts of strange issues, some possibly stemming from the console origins, but who knows.  Gunplay is simply annoying, but you need it to get past checkpoints.  Aiming is lousy, as it is in many ports.  Driving vehicles is almost nearly uncontrollable, where you crash, or drive off the road, etc.  Its mostly a steering problem, which is a problem MANY games suffer from, but its pretty bad here.

3)  Not sure if there's a story.  There's an implied one (pretty standard fare again), but its hard to care about anything.  Seems like just run from thing to thing and smash stuff.

4)  Progress is painfully slow.  Save points seem to be episodic, where even if you save before you're going to attack, when the save reloads, it puts you back to where the episode/checkpoint started.  Why bother....  dumb, just dumb

5)  You can't save without logging into Games for Windows Live.  Yes, you read that right.  Now the concept in and of itself isn't bad (its like the Steam cloud, where you can always load your saves from wherever you are, regardless of computer).  But the software that makes it work is a TOTAL trainwreck.  It can take days to get it to work.  Not kidding.  Total mess, and not thought through or tested.  Shabby

Whats good?

Well, you get to smash things.  I guess thats good.  I found it novel for the first 30 minutes.  Then it was no longer interesting.

You get to collect scrap and make things with it...  not entirely original, but I guess it has some merit (although its annoying the way this works).

Creed is very console orientated. It's selling points are it's visuals- I have a high end pc and can experience everything on full settings as smooth as silk, and it's atmosphere.

On that note, this game is perhaps best game in years to capture the atmosphere and 'feel' of a immersive gaming experience. It actually feels like you are walking around the Holy land, with great shadow effects and lighting. The people who move around you are the closest to actual human beings, without actually being walking digital people. Also, there are no edge effects with this. Everything is very smooth, no rock face is spoiled by a jutting graphic triangle or polygon.

The gameplay is far more simple than I expected, going on what others have spoken of. I can run up to a building, and infact climb and leap over buildings very easily. I think the only real issue is dropping from the hanging position, but that's just experimentation with keys (I'm PC version). Altir is an incredible acrobat and his motoions are some of the best I have yet seen. Having Altir climb and scale walls and buildings is perhaps the games most impressive feat. Dust and small stones fall away under his feet and as you move the camera around him, whether suspended or still moving you can view the people moving below him. That is the shiny end of the coin.

I enjoy the combat system, being able to engage multiple opponants in a realistic manner is fun. Three on one is far more exciting than one on one.

The cons. . well, there is not much in the way of interraction in the game. Sure, you speak to people, but it's not open ended, it's all mission and side mission based. Saving citizens from the guards to give scholar and vigilante aid is fine, but it gets a little bit silly after a while. YOu don't really want to jump down from up high to save somebody just to have some vigilantes appear that you really don't need just to have to climb back up again. Also, it defeats the purpose of stealth and unseen death when you slay guards, to evade them again and carry on like nothing happened. There is not much to 'chew on' in terms of story and side mission. I would love to be able to have a RP element. To perhaps drag your dead into dark corners, barrels, through open doorways. I would like to be able to purchase items from the market vendors, perhaps getting a better blade or having my blade sharpened .. simple details. Can you imagine something as applaudably immersive as Creed combined with something like Oblivion, the RP extravaganza? Creed innovates in a way that paves the way forward for future releases.

The last but not least of the 'issues' with Creed is that it is difficult to exit the game. You have to leave the memory, have your other character get off the table, then quite to the menu, select the name of your saved data and then exit .. that's far too overly complicated.

My advice, get this one in used condition or on sale. It's not that it's not great value for money, but Oblivion cost roughly the same amount and there was far more to experience with it.

It's certainly a worthwhile experience for a gamer, you will spend time marvelling at details and hunting for your next 'job' whilst enjoying the detailed vistas of the far East- get it if not for the experience of moving through the detailed towns and cities.

3.0,False,"10 13, 2010",A1NQ2AY8S778X8,B001HKPUKC,Nerrel,"high voltage announced the conduit to much fanfare, most of it coming from high voltage themselves; they built up the game to be the savior of the wii, a shooter blending the best parts of metroid corruption and perfect dark with cutting edge HD quality graphics that would push the wii in ways no other game had, all with the best FPS controls ever implemented on any system. turns out the game was more or less the wii equivalent of the phantom menace- nearly every element failed to live up to they hype, and the few features that did aren't exactly enough to make for a good game.

starting with what the game got right, the controls are among the best the wii has to offer. the overall scheme is pulled from metroid corruption, but with a slightly less comfortable turning and lock-on system in place. what really makes the controls notable is that they're fully customizable, with button mapping and sensitivity options that were unheard of at the time of release, allowing you to thoroughly tweak your own scheme.

this means the controls are good, right? well, it's hard to know if you can give the developer credit for work that the player has done, especially when their one preset scheme is mostly borrowed from another game. regardless, fully customizable remote options have become standard in every wii shooter since, making the conduit a watershed FPS in that regard. however, the customization still leaves a little to be desired; locking on does not stop turning on the Y axis, which defeats the purpose of locking on (stabilizing the camera) in the first place. vertical motion in general feels awkwardly sensitive and jittery, with your weapon constantly bobbing up and down with the smallest of movements while the horizontal plain remains steady.
adjust all the settings you want, there is no effective way to address this and make the vertical turning feel good. put in a copy of the metroid trilogy, set it to advanced and everything feels right again; the conduit may have the edge when it comes to the range of adjustments but the overall feel is simply not as natural, hammering home the lesson that customization can only do so much without a solid developer based scheme to build off of. that said, the controls can still be tweaked for a great, if not perfect, scheme.

-

the conduit was developed with a new engine built specifically for wii in order to utilize every bit of power at the system's disposal, a wasted effort in retrospect considering that the conduit is one of the most bland and generic games seen this generation. the weapon models are well done with impressive lighting and texture effects, but nearly everything else looks like it's pulled from an n64 game; the blocky, polygonal, drab environments unintentionally hearken back to goldeneye in ways that don't inspire nostalgia.

from sewers to subways to underground bunkers to above ground bunkers, nearly every setting is beyond cliche at this point and yet the conduit manages to make them feel more generic than ever before... walking through the streets of D.C., you'll see storefronts with beige panels where the windows should be, with only a humble neon sign reading ""restaurant"" or ""bar"" to separate one from another. some of the environments are so pathetically uninspired that it's hard to believe this game is running on the same system as metroid corruption, a game with more going on in the background of it's most mundane environments than the conduit has front and center in it's best levels. if it sounds unfair to compare the work of a small developer to a 1st party one, well, high voltage kind of asked to be held to that standard when they un-humbly boasted it would be the wii's best looking game.

it's not just the total lack of art direction that makes the levels boring- the layouts themselves are so linear and repetitive that you'll frequently feel like quitting before the halfway point. every level is a series of beige hallways with only the most basic scattering of crates for detail- this was the state of level design in the late 90's for a reason, being that it was all the limited horsepower of the time would allow. high voltage has no such excuse for the emptiness of their level designs; they simply didn't put much effort in (a fact they've tacitly admitted to with their promise to pay attention to art direction and design in the sequel). there are brief moments where the game lets you out of the hallways and tunnels and actually gives you something interesting to look at, but even then it feels like the game is just managing to look ""adequate"".

--

thankfully the weapons arsenal is fairly diverse and features some creative designs (albeit ones that borrow a little too heavily from perfect dark); you'll be able to find at least one or two guns that will become favorites. some effort has been made to utilize the abilities of the wii remote in firing, such as twisting the remote sideways to activate an alternate fire mode or even directing missiles with the cursor after they've been fired, innovative little twists that are fun to use and work well.

for the entire first half of the game you'll generally be facing two different kinds of enemies with those weapons, guys in suits and guys in armor. then, once alien enemies are introduced, it's once again mostly down to two flavors; big ones that shoot at you and annoying little ones that claw at your legs. while fighting is satisfying early on, it begins to feel a bit like a chore to take down the same enemies again and again in levels where enemies respawn endlessly (which there are a lot of). the game features almost no bosses or special enemies to break up the monotony, with most levels ending by simply giving you a few extra guards to fight before fizzling out. it could have been worse, but high voltage certainly didn't deliver much dynamism in the combat department.

--

if the single player isn't much of a draw, how about the online mulitplayer? shooting real human players with decent guns and precise controls... it's hard to screw up, isn't it? let me describe a typical online encounter in the conduit- you approach another player and empty round after round into their head with no effect. you get the point where you run out of bullets and get shot to death by your opponent while trying to reload; is he hacking? is the game really that slow that it hasn't processed your shots yet? you won't know for another 5-10 seconds, when you'll either see a skull icon appear on screen (indicating that you did in fact kill him at some point during the fight), or see nothing at all (confirming that he was in fact cheating).

the laggy nature of the game removes the ""winning"" part of the equation from winning a fight. you'll often deliver the fatal blow to your opponent only for them to continue shooting you during the several seconds (sometimes minutes) it takes before the game recognizes them as 'dead', often making it impossible for either player to come out alive. the lag is the least of the online problems, with invincible hackers firing rocket launchers like machine guns in nearly every match and a heinous spawn glitch that often makes it impossible to even play at all; after setting up the match and waiting 5 minutes to connect with other players, you'll frequently find yourself staring at a glitched screen, unable to move or even return to the wii menu to reboot the game. this once happened to me 5 times in a row, costing over half an hour of time without a single second of gameplay. the silver lining is that the online mode is very fun when it works, with great guns, challenging enemies and a couple of fair maps to shoot them in... the key part of that sentence is ""when it works"".

---

the single player campaign is bland to the point of unplayable. the online mode rarely connects successfully, keeps up to speed or is free of hackers. all in all, the conduit is a pretty poor excuse for a game. it may sound like i'm being harsh, but no game with this amount of bugs and glitches should have been allowed to reach shelves, and for that reason part of me feels like it could deserve an even lower score. however, the game does stand as having contributed something to this generation of shooters with it's in depth customization scheme, the online multiplayer can be great fun when all the planets align for you and your match actually functions, and the game does deserve credit for taking it's own approach and not using the ""call of duty/battlefield/medal of honor/halo"" mold for it's gameplay, leaving the game with enough redeeming qualities to keep it from being a total disaster.

are those redeeming qualities enough to still justify buying this game now that better FPS like red steel 2, goldeneye, numerous call of duty ports, and even high voltage's follow up, conduit 2, are becoming available? in my opinion the answer is no, absolutely not. pass on it, and pass on it hard.",mediocre to the core,1286928000,,,

But the number one question on everybodys mind is, how dose it match up to the other Tomb Raider's.

It keeps the flavor of prime Lara Croft from let's say Anniversary, but if fails as a sequel. Underworld is the much antisapated sequel to Tomb Raider: Legend, which had a more relistic plot-line and made you feel you're there in a good action movie, and kept you right along with the plot. However in Underworld everything changes durasticaly and the game gives off a sence of un-reality, leaving you saying ""Yeah Right!"" So it fails as being a sequel, how dose it measure up on other things?

GAMEPLAY:
The gameplay for Underworld is relitivly normal to the others, with a few new things here and there.  You do get to wield you're two pistols, however it isn't somthing really remarkable, and get's kinda boring. You get your grapple hook (new since Ledgend) Your dual guns. And some other weapons you collect along the way. you can, however, change Lara's outfits at the beggining of the mission, you can choose from three ( or two wetsuits during water missions).
Warning: However, the camera's are different (in PS3)and the tend to give me massive headaches. the camera angle is absolutly terrible always jumbling around. So I hope you don't have that proberlem with the game.

GRAPHIC'S:
The best part of the game is undoubtbly the graphic's. there are beautiful, and is some of the best graphic's I've seen a PS3 game so far. Except for the charictars, mercenaries, wildlife. they are pretty same-old stuff.

The game dose have the 'flavor' of a Lara Croft game. It is not a good sequel because it didn't keep the Legend feel that would have made the game a hell of alot better. to anyone out there, if a game sequelizes KEEP THE SAME FLAVOR AS THE THING YOU ARE SEQUELING! or it will end up like a flop. It failed everything on being a sequel, but not the out-of-this world Lara Croft that we saw in the originals.

The graphics are great, and the gameplay is flawless (little to no bugs, no lag time, good connection, speedy and flawless moving etc.) My main issue with the game is the campaign and amount of things to unlock. Weapons don't have a large choice, titans are also lacking with choices and weapons mainly.

The campaign was also too short to enjoy mainly because it wasn't a single player campaign with a great story line but rather multi-player that included players that had already beaten the campaign playing on the opposite team/faction. I found this to be a jab because I had though that the campaign would have been longer and more immersed than what we were given.

All in all only *** is what I give this game only because I believe that could have added more but then again it probably will but only through season pass which players will obviously have to shell out an additional 50.00 to gain access to more weapons, maps, characters, etc.

Hopefully EA see's this as I am not the only one and develop a more hands on approach to the game where we have more choices to what we're playing because I don't see this game as a long term game I would play everyday compared to a game such as Halo or FIFA just as an example.",Good game but not enough.,1394841600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I did not, in all honesty, finish the game because I felt it degenerated into a pure slugfest, no tactics or strategy involved (for the most part).  The short  summary is that Homeworld is a fairly typical harvest resources, build  forces, kill the enemy sort of game.  A couple frills with the attempted 3D  interface and the salvage capabilities, but nothing to write home about.  If you want real-time strategy, there are better choices out  there.
First, though the game is, in theory, 3D, very little is actually  done in 3D, and the interface for trying to do so is difficult to manage.  Almost the entire game takes place in effectively one plane (for the core  game, there are a couple of exceptions).  So, while the 3D idea is neat,  very little is done to develop and exploit it. Second, very little strategy  seems to be involved in the game.  The interface is a little too clunky and  micro-manage centric (to use any units with intelligence, YOU must be in  direct control of them) to allow for grand tactics and strategies, and  there is a sad emphasis on the captial ships.  To a large degree, you can  do entirely without fighter class ships (once you reach a certain tech  level). Obviously, game designers have yet to notice that there are often  very good reasons for having smaller stuff on the scene.  The formations  attempt to bring some semblance of order to the game, but those same  formations rapidly disappear in actual combat, making them fairly  pointless. Third, unit intelligence is miserable.  This is not a problem  liited to Homeworld, but seems to be endemic to the strategy genre.  Fight  to the death, you cannot establish a target priority intelligence. you  cannot setup a series of orders (shoot your designated target unless  something juicier or more deadly appears, run to a certain staging area if  you are damaged, guard this ship, but do not leave it's immediate vicinity,  etc.).
On the plus side, the game is pretty smooth.  The views are great,  and the perspective control is very useful (though a camera angle change  could be nice, ie, view out from a unit's perspective, rather than always  looking at a particular unit or view of any area, rather than a unit).  The  repair/refuel and docking capability is cool, as is the ability to jump  around the map (mp only though).

The game can be summed up as: collect relics, get big, smash stuff, get small, repeat. There were some hidden chests in the game that contain objects which can be assembled as power-ups, but it seems unlikely that all parts can be collected in a single play through to obtain any actual power ups (everything you may collect rolls over into additional play throughs).

The random events are repetitive (like in the first one) but this time, you are given a little video at the end of one. At first it's kinda cool, but after a few events, you will see yourself pressing the skip button. On top of that, if you don't do these random events, your Hero/Menace bar will dip towards Menace, which causes the entire city to be on the lookout for you. While it may sound like an authentic Spider-Man experience, it's actually annoying because EVERY BLOCK in the city begins to hunt you down. It's annoying when you just want to get to one place.

The story in the first game was a sort of sequel, which I thought was great. That's not the case here, where it eschews a new story for a retelling of the movie's story complete with conflicts, such as Electro and Spider-Man's meeting being in completely different places.

end of the day, this is basic x and o, A and B football. nothing new...nothing really exciting...and Gameplay Wise, a step Back from 09. i personally say stick to 09, which has a dramatically Better and More Exciting gaming engine...and is the best Madden since 99/2000. or get NFL2K5 :) <- iv got 3 copies of that game...because it is the BEST. watch me get 30 thumbs down for that comment alone :p ONLY BUY THIS GAME if you really think you will enjoy it ONLINE. this game is NOT going to hold u a WEEK on single player modes alone. atleast online, you can have a Blast laughing at your opponent when you shed 7 of his defenders and take it in for 6...

I couldn't believe how people were calling non-stop and asking me, ""Do you have any more.""  The answer was usually, ""No.  You'll have to wait for the NEXT shipment, it sells too fast.""  This of course is a sign for a good game, so I had to try it out for myself.
At first, I found this game entertaining.  You can beat up anybody on the street, pick up any vehicle, (car, van, truck, bus, ect) and follow along on the story mode.  Running into stuff, blowing the vehicle up, and running from cops can even be fun at times.  I was amused by all of these qualities.  However, after a while it seemed like a chore to play the game.
When I actually tried to get somewhere in the game, I found a few tedious features.  First of all, people on the street many times JUMPED or LEAPED in front of my car.  After a while this got annoying because then the cops would blame me and I would be chased around.  This got old fast, because I wasn't even trying to do anything wrong.  Many of the missions got extremely difficult, causing me to have to keep retrying.  After a while, it just was pointless.
Another thing, is that the graphics are not as impressive as they could of been.  The same graphics used in GTA:3 were also used in Vice City.  This could be backed up by saying, ""Well GTA: Vice City, is not GTA:4.""  But I still believe that graphics could've been more improved because of the year it came out.
Overall, the gameplay is pretty good.  You are actually free in this game to do as you wish.  I think that the controls when shooting or punching were pretty bad, but I still have fun for a while.  This game is definately not for everyone.  I found it wasn't for me.  That's why I think it was too overrated.  Sure it's good, has great qualities, and is a sequel to a well known series of games, but it just didn't live up to the hype.

This game is fun but it grows old way to fast. The thing that has caused me to get sick of the game is all of the cut scenes you have to sit through while playing the game. As much fun as it might be to play every time you take your turn you have to watch the little cut scenes as your character takes all the actions and then (if your playing the computer) you have to watch all of the computers scenes. This is definitely entertaining the first few times but then it just bores you and holds up the game.

You've undoubtedly heard that ""Dungeon Siege"" is a game brimming with awesome graphics, ""seamless"" gameplay, and heralded sound. And that's all true. But Dungeon Siege lacks the one thing that it claims itself to be: role-playing. Don't get me wrong; it's still a fun game to play. But if you're a gamer who likes strong plots and powerful character development (as I am), then Dungeon Siege may not be the game for you. However, if you were enthralled with Diablo II's hack-and-slash mayhem, then this might be just your thing. Still, Dungeon Siege lacks any type of user-chosen skill development. Rather, Microsoft has taken the opportunity to present us with a new kind of ""RPG"" that makes your character excel in different areas, whether it be magic, bow, or weapon, depending on how much you use them. Although I understand this thinking and feel it's a novel approach to a game, I would rather decide myself where my character's strengths are. In addition, much of Dungeon Siege is run by smart AI, meaning that your party of adventurers will do what they're told, letting you sit back and watch the melee until it's time to heal with a potion or change somebody's attack scheme. This is all fine until you realize that the whole game can seemingly play itself!
I liked Dungeon Siege for its simplicity, as it presents a nice break to real time-stealers like ""Baldur's Gate 2"". But I can't help to feel a little let down by its elementary nature. The eye candy and sound are awesome, but everything else simply feels rushed. Quests are limited, as are social interactions with non-player characters. Too much of the game is simply walking into a field and left-clicking until everything is dead, with a random award of treasure.
If you're a Diablo fan, I have no doubt that Dungeon Siege will suit your taste. It's actually less of an RPG than Diablo II, but it's hack-and-slash nature will delight. It's hard to put down once you stop. For those into the epic storylines of Bioware's RPGs, then I urge you to play a copy of Dungeon Siege before making the full purchase. It's simplistic, unassuming tone will offend true ""RPG'ers,"" so you've been warned.

Things to know:
- Requires Games For Windows Live (GFWL) account
- Steam installation and account required
- No base building (departs from traditional RTS)

=== SUMMARY ===
I just realized the review has gotten pretty long as I've added other information, so I wanted to write something for those people who want a quick overview:
If you don't mind few units, Steam, Games For Windows Live and lack of base building, you will enjoy the game a lot. The loot/items, unique characters, combat right from the start, persistent troops throughout the single player campaign, and an engaging and different 4 races make this game a great departure from traditional RTS. All wrapped up with great graphics, sound and animation to boot. The single player campaign does become very very repetitive after mission 30 or so. (there are probably 80 plus missions - I'm on 75 and counting)

=== THE BAD STUFF ===
- Steam (more details below)
- You need to be connected to the internet to play the single player campaign.
- You need to be logged in to Windows Live to play the game... ugh...
-&nbsp;
- Single player campaign ONLY for marines... This is just plainly a bad decision. There are 4 fun and distinct races, with multiple heroes each, and they just do 1 (albeit quite long) campaign with only 1 faction, involving just 1 hero. Very disappointed. I hope they add more campaigns for cheap, like 9.99 for a long campaign for the Eldar or Tyranids.
- Can't restart a mission. Got distracted and lost your units? Too bad, you can't restart it to get that reward you wanted. The game goes on even if you fail, which means you have to always be careful of what you're doing.
-&nbsp;

== Steam (why I don't like it) ==
1. No resale value. Period. The software is attached to your steam account upon installation, and you cannot transfer the software or your steam account per the agreement you need to accept. (Kills the second game market - also a word of warning: Do not buy this game used - if someone is selling you one, it either won't work, or it's somehow a cracked version.)
2. You have to log in to Steam to play the game. (offline mode is there but pointless for the game, since you need to log in to windows live anyhow, still needs to run steam though, even in offline mode).
3. SLOW. Opening a game takes forever, since it first has to load up steam, then it needs to connect to steam online, then it starts launching the game. (At least 5 times as long as non-steam games.)
4. You can't play your games if the server is busy (unless you do the walk around every boot up to set it to offline mode). This was a most unpleasant surprise, I did not know Steam would actually go that far, and honestly I cannot think of a worse thing, not even DRM is that annoying. I click on my game, then after about 30 seconds trying to connect to steam, it just tells you something like: ""Our servers are busy, try again later""... I could go on and on about how dumb this decision is, but I digress. How hard can it be for them to do implement the logic: ""If server is busy, launch the game in offline mode"". Note, this wasn't for a minute, I couldn't play it for about half an hour of trying to connect to their servers. Also, if there is a patch, you cannot run your game. My internet connection is not blazing fast so a 150MB patch also leaves you without playing until that's done.... This is unacceptable, period. It is a single player game installed in my local computer, I don't want your server to tell me when I can play it or not.

Note: Steam is not securom or a rootkit or malware like some reviewers are suggesting. It's just an extra software layer, some people love it (you can buy games online, it keeps track of your friends, so you can see who is online and play with them, etc. So there is stuff to like about Steam.

=== THE GOOD STUFF ===
- Co-op single player campaign. You can progress through the campaign online with a friend.
- Graphics are really good, animation is great.
- Loot. (there are white, green and purple 'drops' to powerup the crews from the campaign. So you can customize your characters with new weapons.
- Leveling. You level up both in the single player and the multiplayer games. In the campaign you even get to enhance your stats by spreading those points around. In multiplayer it just increases your attributes, making a veteran squad much more powerful than a new one.
- Tactics are all about combat. (Even though I like base building, it was nice to depart from it - more info below).
- Smaller number of units - (you cannot just outnumber your opponent to victory, you need to plan and use your units accordingly)
- 3 levels of cover (standing behind rocks makes you harder to hit/damage at a maximum level, while standing behind say, a fence gives you only a medium level of cover protection.
- Destructible environment
- The 4 races play very differently, making the game more unique.
- Even though I am disappointed the campaign is only for the Marines, I have to commend the developers, because it's actually a long campaign. I haven't finished it yet, and played through at least 35 missions, if not more. Granted you have the option of finishing it sooner, but I am doing all the optional missions too.

=== NO BASE BUILDING ===
Since these 3 items are new for RTS games, I wanted to expand on Relic's implementation as far as the single player campaign goes:
- I have come to really, really enjoy not having a base. It works superbly along with the small number of units. In typical RTS I found myself building a well defended base, while ""teching"" so I could unload lots of powerful units and overwhelm the enemy. So basically, it took a while to complete a mission, and most of the time was spent building defenses and teching up, while the actual battle took very little, since the enemy was outmatched. In this game, you start fighting right away.

=== SMALL NUMBER OF UNITS ===
Most of the time you control 4 squads (in single player, multiplayer is 100 units per race, which depending on the unit type can be 12-15 squads)
What I like about it:
- You learn to care more about your units. (you cannot afford to lose squads in an important battle) You get to experience each squad's personality through their leader, and they are always with you - they are with you through the entire campaign.
- War tactics become most important. Using cover wisely, using the special items wisely (like a grenade to quickly clear units inside a structure)
- And what I like the most: I know my squads 1 - 4 hot keyed, so I can call upon each squad when I need them. I am not managing 100 units where I just select all and click attack - in order to be successful, you need to plan out your attack, heal your quads when needed, and basically be able to quickly call upon any squad when the need arises. (My sniper squad is being attacked by stronger melee units, I need to quickly hit the hot key of my jump squad to jump there and save them)

=== LEVELING ===
Commenting only on the single player campaign.
Do I want my hero to be melee based, or do I want him to be a range damage type? (through the levels and experience points you can choose a path). Do I want my all purpose squad to be stronger in melee? Or do I want to make it into a range squad? Do I want my sniper team for this mission, or should I go with my melee team?

=== BOSS FIGHTS ===
They are fun, and a lot of them really hard. They can quickly wipe out your squad if you are not careful. They drop powerful items some times, which you can then use to bolster your squad. I think they did this very well, since bosses have special abilities, all the boss fights (so far) have been different from each other.

=== LOOT ===
I like having to make decisions as to how to equip the squad, which squad should get which powerups, which armor is better suited for x, y or z. However, it also suffers the same problems of most loot systems:
- An item will drop that I can't use for 2 more levels (which could take about 4 missions to do at the latter stages).
- Right now I have 6 extra pretty good armor drops level 6-9 green drops (sit unused, or switched in for some missions). While my commander has a level 0 gun, and a level 4 sword (there just haven't been good weapon drops for me). My supression squad meanwhile has like 4-5 great guns to choose from. Basically, it is what it is with random drops. I just wish my hero had better weapons at this point, my sniper team is also pretty weak in the weapons department, as is my all-purpose squad.
- The reward items for completing missions stink at first (white items, and the random drops from the mission are better). In the latter stages the reward items become very powerful. On a side note, a lot of blue drops seem worse than green drops...
- One annoyance is changing the armor of a unit. Sometimes when changing the armor, all your equipped accessories get taken out as well. So you need to re-equip them, which means sorting those 3 items among the 20 others you have in your inventory.

=== CONCLUSION ===
Overall the game is very fun, their departures from traditional RTS games work surprisingly well, but I do wish they had made a single player campaign for the 4 races, as well as polish the game, so the crashes (even after various patches) wouldn't be present. Obviously, no steam or GFWL would be much appreciated.

=== EDIT February 24th ===
Relic released a big patch in hopes of solving the game crashes yesterday. While I was encouraged at first, I actually experienced the worse crash I've had after the patch. Before the game would freeze, and Windows would be active, so you could submit the error to Relic. The crash after the patch was a full blown BSOD (blue screen of death) - and I had never seen one in Vista before. I will update after a week with this patch to see how the game crashes are going. (see March 2nd edit below)

=== EDIT February 25th ===
I have edited several sections and added others. Some things have already been fixed by Relic, so they were no longer applicable. I plan on updating this review as patches are released, so it reflects the current game.

=== EDIT March 2nd ===
The game has been rock solid stable as of late. No crashes or anything of that sort. So they did fix the issue with the large patch.

The in-game tutorial was a little fuzzy on things you were supposed to do. Also, while the game is linear -- it didn't do well leading you through the missions. I often started missions not knowing which way to go and getting bombarded an infinate spawing of troops which led to my demise on several accounts.

While overall it was a good game; it was a short game -- my Amazon account still hasn't updated that it was delivered yet. I completed it in under 12 hours of game play, and I believe I am being generous. If I had spent more money on the game than I had, I would have felt really cheated when I finished -- so it was a good buy for the price.

Past 2ks, especially 2k12 had a real arcade unrealistic feel to it, the game was very player friendly and almost anyone could have picked it up and started doing well. 2k13 is very different with many unforgiving dynamics, where having a good basketball iq is more important than gaming skills if you want to do well. Overall the game is very fluid, with very few if any glitches. Players do act kind of weird at times, like you'll see the AI tony parker cut to the basket where he's free to make a layup but then he'll kick it out to Ginobili in the corner. Also there are times when you got an offensive rebound and you want to go back up to lay it in or dunk, but your guy will for some reason pass it to someone else. Graphics wise there is very little difference between 2k12 and this, you have the usual crappy spectators, which i'll give a free pass to this time but expect much more defined and dynamic graphics for 2k14. One thing that did annoy me were the commentators. Whenever there is a posterizing dunk or anything close to it, you're going to hear the commentators explode in their pants as if it were the all-star dunk contest when it was just a simple slam. Also for you Lebron haters out there you're going to enjoy playing the Heat because the commentators are on their knees whenever he does anything There are some modes to choose from such as creating your own player and playing as him throughout an nba season working yourself up from bench warmer to start, racking up awards and doing post game press-conferences which is pretty neat. But all 2k fans will love this game and it'll keep us satisfied until the new one with Lebron as the cover boy releases, can't wait!

Edit: So after playing this game for a good amount of of time I've taken away my 5star rating and given it a 3. The more you play this game the more frustrating it gets. Forgetting about the gameplay itself I've had this brand new disk freeze up on me numerous times, never when playing but once during half-time, and many times during the cut-scene intro when players are walking onto the court before tip-off. Now with the gameplay, the developers have made it extremely difficult to drive in. The mediocre guards all become hall of fame caliber defenders when you try to drive in, just forget about it. Passing is atrocious, i'll try to pass it to one team teammate who's open but he'll end up forcing a surgical one to another who's doubled and end up turning the ball over. Idk if it has to do with a player's iq rating, but these are obvious passes that no nba player would make in real life. On transitional defense, instead of collapsing into the D my team always ends up trying to slow down the person with the ball which results in an easy layup/dunk. And one more thing, forget about trying to beat the Miami Heat. They are almost near impossible to beat, it's almost scary to how good they are. I am most likely going to stow this away and play 2k12 again.",Perfect 2k? EDIT: Far From It,1372118400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

I generally had a good time playing it, I was extremely impressed by the visuals and overall high standard of technical excellence on display here, and I found the game's world and lore to be fascinating. But at the same time, it's not a game I can wholeheartedly recommend either. Despite having such a great, intriguing premise, the game's actual story is frustrating and not very interesting at any point, despite some great perfomances by the actors in the game. The gameplay (which is only about 50% of the experience of playing this game, as there is a lot of walking around and cutscenes) is competent, yet extremely derivative. The stealth sections of the game, which feel forced, are terrible, and the two key boss fights that play out as nearly identical QTE sequences are startlingly lazy.

The beautiful art and visual design manages to keep each section of the game interesting looking, but it too often feels like a crutch for this game. The game is also very short, clocking in at around 7 hours for a playthrough.

I remember seeing about 3 years ago a piece of this game and thought wow how odd, so i didn't really know what to expect as a full game. Starting off real innovative gameplay mechanics really work sometimes other times not so much. The controls when you first start are a bit difficult and you really find yourself unsure of the purchase you just made, but work through it and it becomes, well maybe not easy but you get the hang of it. The graphics are top notch, and the story is very engrossing, i'm really not going to go into detail only that the premise is ""how far will you go for someone you love""? The actions of the so called oragomy killer are never really clear but all the different locations and storyline plots have many twist and turns to keep you guessing through out. The onscreen commands such as use the left analog stick to take out your enhaler, or to hit different buttons while confronting an enemy are a bit strange at first but really you have to be quick and respond if you want a certain out come. Now if you really don't care you can actually just let the game run alone and not even interfere, which is most cases you won't die, but then whats the point if you don't interact. Plus thats the whole point is making your decisions based on what you want the outcome to be. So while this sounds confusing it can be at some points, but never the less its very fun, just a different kind of game that is the Heavy Metal or games meaning its not for everyone, and won't be a huge off the shelfer, if you will. But i think its great for what it is, i finished the game in around 11 hours, so yes its like most reviewers had said, once you play it, going back to play again really doesn't seem so appealing. So thats really why i give it a 3 instead of a 5. Now mind you if this game had been a downloadable game such as Siren Blood Curse the graphics would not look nearly as good and the game files would be so enormous that you couldn't even fit it on your playstation. But i feel the game should have been 39.99 instead of 60(but hey its sony, thats not going to happen), although i didn't have to worry because i rented the game before it came out due to a friend at the video store giving me early access!! So yes rent the game i would not pay this much for the game even though for the most part it is amazing. They're are few things to left to be desired although they are few and far between. This is basically the score i give, not to add up the numbers for a final score just to tell a little bit about whats what. So if you enjoy interactive movie games than this is definitely the best out there, and there is really nothing else like it on the market.

Graphics-10/10---Buries metal gear solid and killzone 2 into the ground.
Gameplay-8/10---Thats a mixed bag sometimes its fun sometimes tedious, so its really a hard decision.
Controls-7/10---Mostly this goes along with gameplay, so its quirky but as you go along you put up with it.
Storyline-10/10---Engrossing, Sexy, Violent, Offensive, Fun, Intelligent, and the best in years.(says it all)
Voice Overs-8/10---For the most part its spot on, a few areas it out of synce, some more than others.
Atmosphere--9/10---Something i consider most important, and there is plenty of it here.
Replay Value---4/10-Once your done i think to gamestop it will go, so its really just a rental unless you have little time to really get into the game, then by all means buy it. If you have the money, otherwise wait another 2 months when the game is 40 bucks or so, then it will be worth it.

Overall-I would give the game an 7.5 even though my scores look higher. The whole reason is as a package game it really doesn't hit everything 100%, though it tries and does well its a great game for the people who will want it, what really  brings the game down a bit is little replay value if any for most.

But it was still a very good games minus those negatives I just said, GTA4 was a rock solid wall as far as gameplay, it was just awesome.

3.0,False,"10 10, 2014",A361QGAM2IDSBJ,B00BEQLKIU,Consumer,"I have now ordered 4 of these, if that tells you just how much I like them....

And tells you just how likely they are to break...

By break, I mean, I had the red translucent one and the Realtree camo one... and eventually one of the thumbsticks just went crazy.  On the red one, it acted like the right thumbstick was permanently pressed up, making me have to compensate during gameplay by slightly holding the thumbstick downwards (i.e. in driving so I'm looking forward instead of stuck looking at the top of my car).  The red one got the most mileage with about 6 months or so.

The Realtree one was only for PC gaming (no Xbox at all) so it was used even less frequently and broke even faster.  Again, the thumbstick went bad, but I actually think it was the left one.  In games like Skyrim, the character ""view"" would just constantly spin in circles with nothing being pressed, but as if someone were holding the thumbstick to the side.

After the Realtree one broke, it was replaced with a pink translucent one (the cheapest at the time) and I just, this past week, ordered a green translucent one to replace my now broken red one.  So, we'll see if those last longer than the first 2.  Already the pink one has outlived it's camo predecessor.

Word of advice:  Just get which ever is cheapest.  These controllers are excellent, but don't invest $30 or so bucks into one with the likelihood it will have to be replaced.

Even with this major flaw, I still keep ordering it because I just really like the feel of the controller.  It's lightweight because, of course, it doesn't have the battery pack.  I like the stick sensitivity out of the package.  And I love, the most, that the triggers don't have to be pressed down like a full inch to get full power.  The triggers only have about a 1/2"" pull to them AND the spring-loading is slightly looser for easier pressing and snap back just like a normal controller.  The appropriate stiffness, but just easier to press repeatedly and for long periods of time... or for holding down the ""gas pedal"" for long races, where after playing with the OEM wireless Xbox controller, it just freaking exhausts my hands, causes cramping... it's just unnecessarily large.

The controller is also very proportionate.  It really is a ""miniature"" version of the standard controller.  Every thing, buttons, d-pad, sticks, bumpers, triggers are all in their respective places in spatial relation to one another.  And that's why it's great, in addition to it just being simply small and lightweight.

I wasn't especially ""rough"" on these controllers at all, so I can't say that it came from ""wild kids"" throwing the controller around, however, I will say it just being corded as opposed to wireless, did make me more prone to, at times, just dropping the controller on the floor when I was done.  Just natural reaction, I guess, after previous years of gaming with wired controllers.  The Xbox 360 is the only system I've ever had with wireless controllers, so I've tended to be more careful with those, them seeming foreign to me and more like a remote control... and I don't typically just drop the remote in the floor when I'm done with it.  So, I've treated the OEM controllers slightly better, you could say, but also like I said, they weigh more, so you probably wouldn't go dropping them in the floor anyway, considering that and the battery pack potentially popping off the back.  Who knows really, but I did notice a bias in the way I handled the different controllers.  One feels like a gamepad and the other feels like a remote control (a huge, monstrous, heavy one).

I will keep buying these as long as they keep breaking and I can get them for a decent price (less than $20 with shipping).

I'm just warning you... don't spend a lot of money on a specific color or design.  It's not worth it.  Just get them for their functionality purposes alone.  And when not in use, put them up to try to prolong their life and just use your OEM controller for media purposes.

NEVER BUY THEM USED.  There is limited mileage on these things, as I have stated, so I would not trust a seller with a used one.  It could have the broken thumbstick and still look perfectly normal, like I said.  Just don't risk it.

Another MINOR flaw is the D-pad is only 4 directional in comparison to the OEM 8-directional D-pad.  This really isn't an issue in most games.  The only game, I think, I've ever played that allowed usage of the extra 4 (corners) directions is Fallout 3 (and possibly New Vegas) and it's used for setting ""shortcuts"" on to pull up certain items faster.  That's really it.

The first thing that needs to be discussed is the ridiculous control scheme. It is pathetic.  I mean I had trouble connecting my combos since the buttons with the movement of the joystick or even the control pads produce many variables from punches to kicks.  It takes a lot of learning curve to master the game controls.  This is a button smasher which makes it a ""first time"" user friendly.  Yea, button smashing produces combos but not in the classic way that people who played Marvel vs Capcom 2 did it.  It is more preset than intuitively made by the player.

The second thing, the game is painfully slow with a lot of downloading/updating.  No fluidity to the game.  You as player just want to play but you are forced to wait for updates in your profile.  Ridiculous, and sometimes it bogs your PS3 resulting in freezing your game midway through an update or a downloading screen.

I'm not impressed with this game at all.  It isn't Marvel vs Capcom 2 more like a hyped up SSF 6 with ridiculous updates and stupid level up for player profile.

Uses the Wii-Mote Plus to its full potential
Lots of exploration (a la The Wind Waker style)
Dungeons are perfect: not too long, not too short, and just the right difficulty

CONs
Frustrating controls (it took me 40+ hours of gameplay to finally learn how to do a forward jab consistently)
Beginning is agonizingly slow
Storyline is the worst one yet
If you thought Navi was annoying, wait until you meet Fi

BOTTOM LINE
This is a good game, but not great by any means. I almost put the game down because, after three hours, I still wasn't interested in the story at all. I'm glad I kept playing, because around the 5th hour, I got a little more into the game.

The biggest problem with this game is the controls. While they've managed to use the Wii-mote Plus better than any other game so far, it still is frustrating to maneuver throughout the game, and I had lost so many hearts and a couple lives because the Wiimote didn't read what I was doing adequately enough.

It's still a ""Zelda experience,"" but I wish they had done a few things better (particularly the storyline, more than anything else).",Decent Game with a few frustrating aspects,1335225600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Role Playing games are changing it seems.  I have played every one of the Final Fantasy titles.  I remember staying up all night just to try to pass one section of a game or to advance to the next level.  I remember coming home from school and running to the TV to pick up where I left off the night before.  I remember walking and flying across the whole game world and landing on a continent where the enemy was way to strong and proceeded to waste me.  I remember not having to buy a walk-through guide just to play the basics of the game.  Nothing is what I remember anymore.
Now, A red arrow tells you where to go during the game.  You use a sphere grid to advance you players ability.  The lead character is a whinny kid that dresses worse then my ""alternative"" little sister.  The lead character runs around like a lanky, blond haired monkey.  You're playing a movie.  5 Hours into the game you realize that this IS the game and not some long, drawn out beginning.  All you do is walk and talk and then fight once and a while.  And everything take SOOOOO long.  Talk, fighting, running, and scene transitions take forever.  It's almost enough to make we want to break out the ol' Nintendo and play the original Final Fantasy cartridge (for you young ones the First Final Fantasy was on a cartridge.  For a definition of a cartridge refer to Nintendo's top 10 reasons why N64 failed).
But the story is good.  The battles are good.  Talking characters are nice for a while, but can become annoying.  You will feel more a part of the game, although you won't feel like you can make any important decisions (but you're kids, you don't get to make decisions yet).
Over all I give it three stars.  It's beautiful and well worth the money.  However, I don't think that it's a Final Fantasy worthy title.  Developers spend so much time making the 3-D environment pretty, maybe instead they should make it more interactive.  I want to climb, move, break, flick, and smell things.  Also, give my charter free will!  I want to fly into a dragons mouth if I choose to.  Maybe they will have that in FF12 and 12.","Looks good, lacks a Final Fantasy name",1011657600,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

That was the case with Mortal Kombat Komplete. I just got done playing that for about 2 or 3 weeks, and loved it. It's graphics, controls, physics, detail and sound where 5 stars. Which brings me to this version of Mortal Kombat, versing the DC universe. This game was released 3 years before MK Komplete (MK9) and you can see the massive improvements right away in MK9 compared to the stiffer controls and weak hit detections of this game. This has been the biggest problem I have found with this game. MK9 is fast paced, combo's galore, and you can dominate, where as DC, for a real hardcore MK fan, it just does not run fast enough and your strategy is to time moves and what not more then just get in on the action. Some controls feel sluggish, and others have been programed to not allow you to spam the move over and over again by way of it either won't work, so you end up doing to different specials, one after the after, or it works so well it just becomes repetitive and boring. But then again, the AI catches on and counters most of it. Overall, it does not feel like it's a well balanced game. It comes off more like some characters are just plain better than others when you master their special moves.

The fatalities are pretty watered down in this. I suppose with a fatality like the Joker pulling out a gun and shooting someone in the head is far from complaining that it's made for kids, but then again, it feels more like the home console version of the original arcade game where so much was watered down from the blood filled arcade that it ruined the home console versions till cheats where discovered on how to put the blood and guts back into it.

Story mode was, to say the least, pretty boring. It doesn't take long to complete. You can choose either DC or MK and play in 2 different sides of the story. The story is that in one universe, Raiden electrifies Shao Khan as he is going through a portal, and in a parallel universe Superman does the same thing with his laser eyes to whats his face. This someone causes Khan and whats his face to merge, and the two worlds start to slowly merge together. DC and MK members find themselves battling each other, because the now merged Dark Khan is effecting their rage and causing them to fight each other instead of realize they are all fighting to save Earth. I'm sure you can guess how it ends.

The graphics are nice enough for what they are, and the sound it ok. But this game really lacks in a lot of things other than the controls that I already mentioned. Each character only has 2 fatalities or hero brutalities. There is no friendship or babality which would have been perfect for this game. There is only a few modes to play. Arcade on 1 player only, story mode (2 sides to choose), vs (2 player) a kombo challenge and practice. There is no tag team, no 2 player story mode or ladder matches, and no test your anythings to keep you occupied after you have completed the story modes. Pretty much, unless you love the controls of this game for some reason, or are just obsessed with having DC and MK characters fight it off, then this game is pretty disappointing in the end when it comes to replay value. It's just such a shame the DC characters did not become DLC for MK9, or even a DLC for a kreate a karacter and you could build these guys from DC etc ... it would have made fans of this game forget it even existed.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the game is horrible, I'm just saying it's far from perfect.

When playing there are some quarks to the game, The mouse cursor can only be clicked at certain places in the cinema. Sometimes the click of your mouse does not register with the game's functions and some puzzles take a few more minutes to figure out than others - this leaving the player to view the same cinema (when you make a mistake) over and over again. This game comes with 3 CD's and is almost 2 hours in length. This means you have to CD swap in between new levels. The upside to your hard work is that you can save the cinema and watch it all over again like a real episode of Star Trek The Next Generation when the game is finally completed.

It really feels like I'm playing the same exact game, over and over with a new character here and there, and spruced up graphics as the systems go on. There are just two reasons why I bought this one in the first place- it was cheap, and I wanted to see how nice Ivy looked on a current generation console. Isn't that terrible? Hey, at least I'm being honest here. I've always been more of a Guilty Gear and Street Fighter player. SC never got ahold of me, despite consistently being a gorgeous game series and using weapons instead of hand to hand combat.

If you haven't played a SC game before, it's just a 3D weapons-based fighting game. You can move around your opponent, win via Ring Outs and...man, that's really it. For the gameplay, the game is fun if you're playing casually or with a bunch of friends taking turns. SC has never been much of a competitive game, especially considering that most people use the term 'button masher' at some point when describing it. And that's completely true- anyone can beat the game or another person if they just randomly hit buttons. To this day, I don't know how to do Mitsurugi's better moves, but doing standard attacks and grabs seems to get me on to the next round just fine. The characters aren't that balanced either, and you'll rarely see anyone using a good 70% of the roster. And they went and did the tie-in for The Force Unleashed, throwing The Apprentice and Darth Vader in here. Vader is weird to play as, and can use some Force powers, but plays like an SC character. The Apprentice however, is very cheap and definitely overpowered. He could've been the final boss in the main game modes and aside from not fitting in with the SC world, it would've been a good battle.

So what's new with SC4? Not much. You can play online- always cool for fighting games, but depending on your connection there could be lag, and that always kills the fun unless you master the timing (yes, some people actually do that). There's a Tower of Souls mode, very similar to the modes in pervious SC games that gets you money to unlock more items and weapons, and offers some real challenge, like beating 3 enemies in a row via Ring Out, or switching to your partner instead of wasting everyone with just one character. The main thing I like is the Create a Character mode. There are tons of clothes, armor, accessories and everything to help make a truly unique character of your own. If you want your guy to wear pants on his head, go for it- you can do it here. There's also downloadable content like Christmas outfits and of course for the ps3 version here- Yoda. You have to pay more than you should for him, and he's such a cheap character that people will just get mad if you use him, but if you want all the characters, you'll need him. Also, you can now break armor and weapons, and get a kind of instant kill attack. Should you keep blocking attacks, your armor will break (not that some characters have much armor to begin with). It's a nice addition but it didn't happen enough when I was playing to affect gameplay. Lastly, I have to give them some credit for the new character that fights with both a spear and a short sword. I love playing as lancers in any game, and it was good to see a lovely lady representing the class finally. 'turns out that she's one of the better characters too.

Visually, the SC4 continues the tradition of looking incredible. Animations are smooth and never jerky, and they've gotten better on rendering things like hair and cloth. The music is generic, and I never paid much attention to it, but the voices match their characters well in both Japanese and English, for the most part.

Really, most of my negative comments aren't that negative. It's just that the series desperately needs something new. If you haven't played a game in the series, you might like it more than someone like me did. SC4 is great to look at, even with it being an older game now, but if you want a deeper or just plain more memorable fighting experience on the ps3, go for Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo or BlazBlue.","Well, it's another Soul Calibur game.

I have the following mice to give a fair assessment of what I think of this Corsair Scimitar:
- Corsair Scimitar Pro
- Razer Naga Epic Chroma
- Logitech G600
- Zowie ZA12
- Logitech M510

Pros
- Lightweight
- Customized lighting in 4 zones
- Multi level DPI configuration levels w/on the fly switching
- Button grid that can be slid forward and back for better hand position
- Textured buttons with the 5 button with nib
- Braided cable

Cons
- Very much a palm mouse. If you claw, it may take a while to get used to
- My 4 button gets stuck at times spewing 4's across the screen. I have to wiggle it to make it stop. Very bad.
- Can only store 3 hardware profiles. This thing should be able to store a 100.
- Clicking the middle scroll wheel as a button is way too rigid. Imagine setting this to spacebar for jumping in a FPS. It too rough and should have more ""give"" to it.
- No lighting per button. Would be nice to distinguish rows for software purposes (i.e. editing, movement, building, fighting, etc.)
- Cue software UI sucks for setting up this mouse. As a new user, you are better off deleting all the Actions and starting from scratch to learn the UI.
- Top button next to mouse wheel is hard wired for profile switching. What if I wanted to use this for something else?
- Surface calibration feature doesn't work well. I get terrible lag when trying to drag and draw in a circular pattern that it makes me wonder if this is even calibrating right. This, at 1600 DPI setting on a Corsair XXL mat and fast Ryzen 1700X.

Improvements needed:
- Get rid of the metal plate. Its unnecessary baggage that adds to the weight of the mouse and cost. The lighter the better for less hand fatigue.
- Storing only 3 profiles is lame. Many of us play way more games and use many applications. Let us store at least 100 profiles by designing the mouse to use microSD to store the profiles on. When you click the profile button, it brings up a dialog box that lets us select which profile to use. You owe me Corsair for this idea.
- Cue software needs to not show panels that don't correlate to the present view. For example, why should the left panel of buttons that have nothing to do with the grid buttons be shown? Also don't show the G1-G10 panel when it has nothing to do with the present view. Stupid things like this clutter up the UI configuration and cause confusion. The lower panel also needs to be in sync with the present focus of the button.
- Way too long of a cable. I attach this to the back of my Corsair Strafe keyboard port and you won't believe how ugly this looks on the desk. Supply a short braided 3' cable and a 10' cable. I've also have too many USB connect/disconnect problems in this configuration.
- Ability to slide the grid back another 1/4"". People with small hands (even kids) have to go into claw mode instead of palm mode to get at these buttons. For example, I rest my palm on the mouse and my thumb is comfortably on the 5 key. The button grid is all the way slid back. However, when I need to reach for the 123 keys, I have to physically lift my hand off the mouse and reach for the 123. If I don't, I risk clicking on two keys (i.e. 1/4, 2/5, 3/6). This forces me to push my hand forward wasting valuable time, especially in FPS games.

One thing to consider that I noticed on all my MMO mouses is that if you have a need to lift the mouse off the mat, these devices are not ideal.  First, they are heavier than your typical gaming mouse like the Zowie EC. Over long play sessions, you develop hand fatigue. Second, you can accidentally click one of the buttons on the grid at an inopportune time, espeically while you are playing a fast FPS game. Lastly, finding a means to even grip onto something and lift is a problem - there's nothing to grab onto and feels way unstable. The design on this mouse is awkward. Along the right hand side there is a textured rubber grip region. But, my ring finger and pinky can't grip this and lift without feeling like I'm losing grip.

These types of mice are best suited for palm players with larger hands. More for your Warcraft, Dota, type of games rather than FPS.  If you are going to use this for FPS and play with low DPI and need to lift, good luck! More times than not I have felt that I lost the sense of grip and moved from palming, to clawing.",Room for improvement,1512259200,4,{'Color:': ' Yellow'},

In mid jumps the camera angles change so you have to be prepared to reverse your controls in mid jump, or fall to your doom.  The voice actors are very terrible, none of which sound remotely similar to the characters from the shows.

First of all, I really wasn't fond of the battle system all that much...I didn't like the idea of the enemies leveling up with you.  I guess Square did this to make the game go quicker, but that just made things dull.
Second of all, the junction system wasn't a bad idea, but the idea of relying on the GFs and Squall's Renzokuken doesn't really appeal to me or any other gamers.
Third of all, it just seemed too rushed.  They didn't spend the proper amount of time on this game as Square did in number seven and number nine.  It just seemed like everything was assembled in only a series of two months.
Well, I don't wand this to seem negative, so I'll just jump to the positive points.  First off, the graphics.  Everything looks crisp, clean and very attractive to the human eye.
Second of all, the music.  Nobuo Uematsu is a VERY talented composer, he comes up with some amazing musical scores that is well on its way to blow you off of your chair.  However, it seems that he was rushed on some of the pieces, and it didn't look like he had enough time to finish some of them.
Third of all, the storyline IS a good storyline, but the game just seemed far too linear, and extended over a long period of time.  When you first play it, you can't get away from it.  But after you complete it, you may not want to start a new game right away.  And the second time, you may not play it as often as you did the first time.

3.0,False,"09 13, 2004",A1OZ0PGAE70JQI,B00029PMOS,Griswel,"This game is fun, but it's not for everyone the way Rollercoaster Tycoon was (heck, my sister, middle aged like me, played RCT, and she plays very few games of any kind).  Locomotion has a simple premise, but it's tougher to get a handle on the game's mechanics than was true in Rollercoaster Tycoon.

The interface is very similar to RCT/RCT2.  Laying tracks is very much like making queue lines in the RCT games.  Unfortunately, making queue lines was never the strong point of RCT, since the four view choices can leave you with no way to ""see"" the spot you need to see.  Also, having train tracks cross each other is a bit clunky, and getting cargo to industries that use it is tough to time just right.  If one needed cargo arrives in a different month than the other needed cargo (e.g. ore and coal arrive in different months), then nothing will ever be made.  The first cargo disappears before the second arrives.

It's also not clear how you can make money (hint: go for passengers, not cargo).  So you can easily spend all your money making, say, a cargo ship system, and find that you're never going to do well.

Still, the game is simple to jump into for older gamers.  Laying track is simple, and other vehicles are even easier.  It's getting these to mesh that gets harder.  There's a good deal of planning that has to be done in your head to get a good system up and running.  Where RCT would tolerate my ten year old's complex queue lines, Locomotion would leave her frustrated.

If you're looking for a simple, fun game, Locomotion is fine for teenagers and other gamers with a good deal of experience.  The graphics are functional and don't add or detract from the game.  The interface will be simple to pick up for anyone who played RCT, and not too tough for others.  The tutorial helps alot with the basics.  One big improvement over RCT: you can speed up time (3x or 9x)!  I wish I'd had that in RCT.

However, the fun factor is no where near as high as RCT, the graphics will disappoint most who have played Railroad Tycoon 3, and the city-building won't match SimCity4.

Starting with the positives, the game has great cartoony visuals with bright colors making it very appealing to look at and the sound is actually very good for the Genesis. In terms of story It's very simplistic as are many media tie in games of the early gaming era. You play as the Warner Brothers and Sister Yakko, Wakko, and Dot as you go from a number of stages on the Warner movie lot to snag props from each film. Along the way you must get past several characters from the series who block your way. The gameplay is easy to pick up on. Each Warner has a special ability that can be used to solve puzzles, so you switch through as needed. Unfortunately, the gameplay can get pretty grating. The game has large sections of platforming, and landing a jump causes your character to slide ever so slightly. This causes you to spend a lot of time attempting the same jumps over and over again. This isn't so bad when you can just walk back and try again, but in levels where falling means death you can end up having to repeat the whole level for one jump. The hit detection is also a little off. Since none of the attacks have a very good range boss fights can be annoying.

For this game, the flaws tend to even out the benefits. It's not bad, it's just not great. It's okay.

3.0,False,"01 12, 2004",A3VE7FK9QDWJVU,B0000A8VBZ,Vano Chu,"The violent killings are entertaining and some of the dialog spoken by your victims is funny. What killed it for me was the 'safe shadows' stealth mechanic: If you're hiding in the shadows, a hunter can be standing 2 feet from you, looking in your direction, and be unable to see you. Note that you are not hiding behind something, or camouflaged, or prone; you're just standing there just on the other side of the line where light/dark meet.

For a game that is supposed to be an immersive experience (e.g. hunters react to sounds you make in the headset, call for help, etc.), this very contrived and artificial implementation of stealth takes me out of the story and reminds me that I'm just playing a video game with certain programming rules that the computer AI must follow. (Which is fine except that it's not what I thought I was buying. I can play Tenchu or Metal Gear Solid if I want to play a stealth game with clearly defined ""rules"".)

 So, the game then becomes a series of
 1) try to stealth kill a hunter
 2) mess up and alert all the enemies in the area
 3) enemies chase you and yell stuff at you
 4) you run around a corner and duck into a dark area
 5) four hunters stand around your 'safe' zone peering into the darkness and complaining how they've ""lost"" you even though you're standing inches from them (hunters will NOT step into the dark zones unless they saw you run in there)
 6) hunters return to their pre-programmed routes and completely lose their alert status
 7) go back to step 1

 Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

After a while, it reminded me too much of the games of ""tag"" I used to play at school where a certain tree/pole/tire was 'safe' and you couldn't be tagged while you were touching it. Would've been much better if the AI would at least try walking into the shadows from time to time when they were looking for you to keep up the suspense level. As it is, you just sit there, perfectly safe (and bored), waiting for the enemies to cycle through their pre-programmed ""alert"" status and go back to their normal patrol routines.

Anyway, my$0.02. Depends on what you're looking to get out of this game. I suggest renting it for week first and see if you're still interested in playing it after that.

3.0,False,"05 12, 2010",A27G9LMQTMND03,B000JLIXI6,Patrick_91,"Genji Days of the Blade was a launch title for the PS3, I was reluctant to get it when it was $69 due to my previous negative encounter with Genji: Dawn of Samurai. Its safe to say at this point I'm glad I waited and picked this up for $5 at a pawnshop.

Genji Days of the Blade (Genji 2) takes place pretty much after the events of Genji 1, people who didn't play the first Genji need not worry, the events of the game are shown to you before you start playing Genji 2. Yoshitsune and Benkei both make a second appearance in this game, you also get to play as Shizuka who was previously unplayable in the first game. Also joining the cast is the god of war Buson who has decided to use the body of Genji 1's boss. Overall the characters all have some sort of negative trait to them except for Yoshitsune who can practically attack non-stop, Benkei is absolutely useless, hes much too slow to do anything except for when you have to use his special attack, he is really painfully slow, sure he has massive attack power, but what good is it when you can only get in 1-2 hits before taking a few hundred point of damage? Shizuka is a little faster at attacking the Yoshitsune, but can only string together 4 combos at a time and then slightly pauses, causing her to take lots of damage, and of course being a female character her defense is pitifully low, this wouldn't be bad if you didn't have to worry about her dying, but if even 1 character dies, its game over and you have to start from the beginning! Then there's Buson, sure he looks badass, but his move set stinks, you have to always strife to get his true move set, so he will sting together 4 attacks then you have to time his strife to do another 4 attacks, useless for some bosses as they move to fast for you to get any decent hits in. Basically what I'm getting at is even though you seem to have 4 characters, there is only 1 useful one, Yoshitsune. The other characters are just along for the ride.

Now there's the story, my god, its painfully dull, bland and useless. Space Invaders has a more moving story than this game. The voice acting tries to stay true to the Japanese theme and uses people with Japanese accents, Bleh hated it, the characters feel dull and lifeless,not enough character development going on. I couldn't care less if Yoshitsune's love interest died saving his life or if it was the other way around. To sum it up, boring story, never have I cared less about a story this much....

For the battle system, to some it up, You ever play Dynasty Warriors? Cause Genji 2 is a DW clone, you fight hordes of enemies and then have a boss battle, watch a few cut scenes in between the regular battles and the boss battles, rinse repeat. There is also a limited set of items adding a false difficulty to the game, then you have save points that can be within 10 minutes of each other or 1 hour within each other, that's just plain stupid, and really grinds my gears when I only want to play a 30min session, but have to go another 30-40min longer than planned because I have to find a save point. very frustrating! And now for the biggest complaint, Genji 2 employs the use of a fixed camera...a FIXED CAMERA this can make things much more harder than they need to be in this game (it seems Sony slapped on another layer of false difficulty) you might be running around like a headless chicken, only to discover your destination was just a few more feet forward, but you cant see the door because the fixed camera won't change the angle to let you see this door, also get used to being hit off screen almost all the time. Needless to say,the fixed camera should have had many more angles of the same area as it makes the bad camera angles in Devil May Cry look good. Then there's is that useless smudge on the screen known as the mini-map, it doesn't tell you where to go and doesn't display the location of an enemy very well, The game probably didn't even need the mini-map,its that useless.

The only redeeming factor of this game is the graphics....erm I mean character models, in all fairness they look really good (probably the best looking characters in the PS3's first year out),but what good is that if everything else in the game is bad? Overall I cannot recommend this game. Get Ninja Gaiden Sigma instead if you want to play as an asswhuping Ninja!

Pros:

+Great looking Characters (possibly some of the best looking for the PS3's first year)
+Good looking...box art? (probably conned a few people into thinking the game was good!)

Cons:

-Crappy Story
-Forgettable Characters
-Fixed Camera
-False difficulty with the fixed camera and set amount of items
-Tries to be a dynasty warriors clone
-And Fails
-Not worth the install on you PS3's HDD (I think its around 2GB)
-Yoshitsune is the only good character whats the point of the other 3 if they all border useless (esp. Benkei)
-Should have been boxed with the launch PS3's,for the outrageous $69.99 they were asking you should have got much more game, and a lot less crap.",I've Played Better...,1273622400,4,,
3.0,False,"05 30, 2014",A32O98PFC3OP7K,B00CXCCB64,A Gamer at Heart,"I have been playing this franchise since BF 1942 was first released for a PC. So, its been a while. Starting with BF 3, the franchise started a slow slide into mediocrity. Because of my very lukewarm love of BF 3, I decided to not buy this on release day like I had all prior entries in this franchise. Glad I waited given all the now legendary launch problems, gameplay glitches, and massive patches. I picked this up on sale for $30.

The good news is the bugs appear to be gone.  The multiplayer plays as it should. The not so good news is the gameplay is identical to BF 3. It looks the same, plays the same, and for all intents and purposes BF 4 appears identical to BF 3. The campaign is the exact same tired formula you have played in every other modern military shooter. Even on the hardest difficulty setting, I am a bullet sponge who can absorb absurd amounts of damage. For a game that prides itself on being a bit more grounded and realstic than COD, I find this to be immersion breaking. My AI teammates also appear immune to enemy grenades. Of course when I go into McDonalds I expect McDonalds food. But even McDonalds adds some new menu items from time to time to keep things fresh. No such variety in BF 4.

I was also disappointed with the graphics. I am not one to overlook gameplay in favor of graphics, but I was really expecting BF4 to pop on the Xbox One. Instead, the MP maps look muddy and muted. It is actually difficult to see at times. I am switching back and forth from this game and the new Wolfenstein - and the latter game's graphics really pop and are impressive on the Xbox One. So, I know it's not just me or my TV. I also googled the issue and saw similar complaints. I point this out only so you don't pop in the disk and expect ""next-gen"" graphics from BF 4. The campaign graphics are a little better than the MP, but they are nothing that will make you go ""wow.""

The other item I have an issue with are the game modes and multiple weapons that are shown as menu items and weapon options but are only available with expansion purchases/premium membership. It leaves the impression that EA has sold me 80% of a game and if I want the remaining 20% I must pay another $50. It's not a consumer-friendly business model, especially after how they have botched and degraded this franchise. Frankly, these ""pay-to-win"" additional weapons and extra game modes/maps should be free to restore some good will from players. EA is crazy if they think customers will flock to the already announced next addition to this franchise.

If you decide to try this game, I can't recommend spending a dollar more than the $30 I spent.

3.0,False,"10 10, 2010",A26G35WR7QCFR2,B004774IPU,Kevin R. Haughn,"Five years have elapsed since the last Civilization title was released.  Back in 2005, Civilization IV came on to add some musical and graphical enhancements that Civilization III (released in 2001) lacked.  Back then, I wrote a review about Civilization IV as being a true rip-off in every sense of the word: everything from the intentional incomplete original version that required expansion packs to fill it out, to the poor interface that was redundant or logically absent.  I also forewarned, in my review, that expansions were imminent.  With the original title running at $50 at the time, and the expansions running about $30 each (two total), it was a damn insult that they expected us to drop over $100 on a game that was both an insult to our intelligence and a rip-off.  However, per my review, after Civ 4 was finally expanded, it turned out to be a pretty sweet game, though I still recommended that nobody buy it, primarily because the modification process of the game was nearly impossible, in any meaningful sense, for the average gamer.  (Besides the insult to our intelligence.)  Lastly, I made a prediction that about five years would go by, and the ""complete"" version (a fully expanded game) would be less than $20, so if you had to have Civilization IV, just wait a while for it to be worth the expenditure.

Well, while I recommended that we wait for Civ 5 to come out and hope that it was better and less of a rip-off, I noticed that Civ 4: Complete Edition is being sold for $12.  Through all this, I have been diligently modifying my magnum opus scenario in Civ 3, which I consider to be the best Civ title to date.  What will Civ 5 be like?  Today's date is 9/14/10; Civ 5 comes out a week from today on Tuesday.  It is listed, as usual, for $50: the price offered for all the new releases of our day.  Seeing this, I had a review for Civ 5 before even playing it, and it is more of a philosophical plea than anything else.

To begin, assume the following:

1)  Civilization 5 is going to be addictive and fun as hell.  You will spend countless hours learning how to play this thing, plus playing it nonstop once you do master it.  That is just how it works with Sid Meier's games, and that is why we all want to buy and play them.

2)  Civilization 5 is just the first title in this fifth installment.  I am willing to bet my life and yours that there will be at least one expansion pack coming out later, maybe next year by Christmas 2011.  This means that Civilization 5, the original title here, is not fully expanded.  This means that there are some really cool features that you and I want but won't be getting until we spend another $30 on the title for the expansion.  Therefore, Civilization 5 is not a complete game.  Is that worth $50 to you?

3)  Civilization III: Complete is on sale for $10.  Civilization IV: Complete is on sale for $12.  That is, for $22 (plus tax), you can get one totally awesome, easily moddable game (Civ 3) and a pretty darn good game (Civ 4) for less than half of the cost of a brand new, incomplete, plausible waste of space.  (Well, at least until Civ 5 gets expanded and completed, that is.  Until then, you know what is coming: $30 expansion packs for Civ 5, while Civ 3 and Civ 4 are ready to go.)

Given these assumptions and facts, my recommendation is simple - it is the same recommendation that I made five years ago, and the same one I will make so long as my brain understands logic.  That is, wait five years, friends, for Civilization V to be fully expanded and cheaper.  I guaran-damn-tee you that you can buy Civilization V for $15 in 2015.  Let's call it a gentleman's wager.  Here, I wrote it down for everyone to see.  Come back and read this review in five years and tell me I was wrong.  Avoid the impulse and forego Civ 5 for just 60 more months.  Play Civ 3 and Civ 4 complete editions in the meantime.  Heck, there are many Sid Meier games out there - play them for the next five years.  They were awesome when they came out, and they still are.  Build your library of all the video games from 2000 to present.  Call it your Aught Decade Collection and rock it.  (I call mine the Nil Decade Collection.  Nil is one of my favorite words in the English language.)

Anyway, save yourself some money and enjoy the classics for a long while.  Heck, do what else I did, which was to download some NES, SNES, GBA, and N64 emulators (you can get SEGA and others, as well) and download hundreds of the classic video games from the 1990s and prior.  On this one laptop of mine, I have over a thousand video games.  (Back them up on DVD, by the way!)  And I am not talking weak sauce games, but I am talking all the greats.  In addition to all those great console games from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, I have about 30 games or so just for the PC.  While Windows 7 is a worthless operating system, and the computer market is hard to discern, I can still say that these investments (in both time and money) have provided me with ample entertainment for as long as I have owned them.  (Going on 25 years now.)

So why an impulse buy for games that you know beforehand are incomplete?  My philosophy is that we show these guys who is boss.  In capitalism, the markets are controlled by demand, especially as assisted by price.  In this case, buying incomplete video games for $50 (instead of, say, a complete game, brand new, for $75) and then buying expansion packs at $30 a piece is like buying illicit, controlled substances.  You can only have so much fun with incomplete video games and controlled substances.  After you spend too much money, then you realize the perfect scenario: a drug high that lasts your entire lifetime, and a video game that still rocks your ass 25 years later.  That is, it would be more logical and fair to get it all done at once for one fair price, and not this piecemeal sales technique that is designed to make you look stupid but feel good while you are doing it.

C'mon, people: boycott this type of marketing technique where they intentionally leave out the really good stuff, only to charge you more for it later, and then sell you the ""complete edition"" some four or five years later for about an eighth of the initial cost.  We saw this with The Sims games, too, only they usually drum up about six or eight expansion packs, hoping you will buy the completed title for a whopping $250 when it is all said and done.  (As of this date, The Sims 2 has not yet reached the Complete Edition status.  They have been idiotically bundling some of the expansions together, though not all into one complete package.  However, all told, a completed version of The Sims 2 will run you about $125, unless you also want the stuff packs, which cost more.)

To close, this is my recommendation: wait until Thanksgiving of 2014 or 2015, and then buy Civilization V: Complete for about $20.  If you wait until after Christmas and into the new year, you can probably get it for $15 or less.  By then, we will have been subjected to Civilization VI, which will not have been completed by that time, either.  Follow the patterns, folks, and let's teach these people how to market games to us.  We are not idiots.  Thwart their schemes with good old-fashioned American market control: don't buy crap.  (Communism, of course, forces everyone to buy crap.  Let's not act like communists!)","Again, It Is Time To Wait For The Complete Version",1286668800,8,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Now the game as a basis is not bad at all, the campaign is pretty much a yawn, but as most would more than likely say, I play this for the multiplayer.

I would reccommed this game to the younger audience, hardcores will quickly find themselves individuals topping charts over and over again. Its very easy to kill people, so much so I sometimes wonder the age or mental status of the opponent players.  That said you can be the best player in the world, and if someone spawns behind you, you will die no matter your skill level. And sometimes the spawns can be rather random and frustrating. This is the main reason I dislike this FPS compared to others where you don't insta die. Halo, even Battlefield and MAG at least give you a shot to overcome your disadvantage with skill.

I never tried Lumines 1, since I just recently got a PSP. So I picked up part 2 seeing that it's getting good reviews and part 1 is in most of the 'gotta have this for the psp' listmanias. I received my copy of part 2 a few days ago and played it for about 45 minutes.  I just wasn't getting into it. I tried the challenge mode, puzzle mode, and also mission mode. All are 'fun' I'm assuming if you are into this game.

I love Tetris and think I'm really good at (or at least I used to be). This game seems a lot like tetris with the exception of everything coming down in a four square bock with 2 different colors usually. You have to create cubes of 4 squares which can be added on to by 2 other same colored squares to create a 6 block square..then 8...then 10...it can keep going up until the time line (which is pretty quick) flys by it erasing the completed blocks. As you progress, the colors of the cubes will change during play..as well as the music and backgrounds...which I'm guessing is there to try to confuse you or maybe just change up the look of things.

I didn't find this fun...at all. I was really bored.

Since I really didn't care for the game, I'll list some reasons why I do think the game is decent for fans of it. The Puzzle mode seems pretty challenging which is always a good thing...if you care for the game. Mission mode was probably my favorite mode. I like puzzles where they want you to do something in a certain amount of trys, and this is what mission mode basically is. You cant mess up one time or you lose.

The reason I gave this three stars is, while it's mostly stable on my system (running XP Pro on 1.6 ghz, 312 meg, 32m TNT2, SB live) there some notable problems. The primary `problem' is really to do with the fact that this game is only a marginal improvement over HH 2002 (more like HH 2002 v2 and yes, the mount visit works) with graphics that are just slightly better than the uninspired graphics in HH 2002 - given the low price for this game, it makes you wonder.
The sound glitches still occur (sputtering announcing, music is completely offkey, etc) and the game fps gets so choppy beyond an 800x600 resolution that they shouldn't even give options to run it up to 1280x1024. There are really odd looking models being used... there are three complexions for the players, light, medium and dark but the head/face color seems independent. For example, Roger Cedano when he turns in as he avoids a ball has a face this very light while Alomar's arms are very dark but his head is medium (alright, I'm playing the Mets, so what). I know this sounds minor but it looks horrible. The stadium and the ads/billboards still look like they are in very lo-res.
As for the game play, itself... it's fine so i wasn't expecting major changes (and there were none), it's one of things keeping this series alive. Personally, I would prefer that HH builds in a player salary function - even though there isn't a cap, I think it's something that should be a consideration in trading. Also, I think the minor leaguers' stats need work... I'm routinely able to bring in AAA players that will start dominating right away.
I would like to add that there are several exceptional HH communities that provides updated rosters (including all minor leagues), updated/corrected stats, pictures, numerous types of play tuning files, corrected stadiums and ads, uniforms and sounds (the game's only been out for a week and there are updated rosters and tune files already for HH2003).

The clerk at the counter briskly warned me 'you will be disappointed',the guy seemed like a game snob so I paid no attention.

SO IS IT WORTH BUYING?
Yes and no...I'll clarify. I did notice the cinematic voice overs had a slight delay but I didn't care that's not what you buy a game for but yes the originals didn't suffer this issue. The fog in your roaming environment isn't quite as thick as the original versions but it's still effective and lends atmosphere to the game. These things I can overlook in a $29.99 game bundled with two Silent Hill games that are out-of-print...my problem was Silent Hill 2. There will be off and on times in SH2 where I'll try to attack an enemy and the glitch kicks in-you can't move,attack,pause the game, or even exit out to quit the game to restart. Completely functionless. Basically you stand there like an idiot while a monster tears you to shreds. The second bug I've encountered a few times only is running-making a long sprint down a hall occasionally I've seen the character stop, more like a glitch/stutter effect. To conclude it's nice to come back and play the earlier Silent Hill games so I can't say the collection is entirely a waste of money. But when overall controller function issues kick in?yeah that's a problem there's no excuse for. It's a shame too because I've got my heart set on Konami releasing a bundled version of all of out-of-print SH games and I was hoping this would keep me satisfied for a while...just not like this for future reference.

The single player campaign is really just here for the sales and should be avoided by anyone expecting a rich, immersive gameplay experience.  The campaign is linear, repetitive, almost completely hack 'n' slash (there are perhaps two subquests in the entire game that don't have ""killing the boss"" as the main aim) and plays much like Diablo with 3rd Ed AD&D rules.  You can play the same campaign through multiplayer, online or on a LAN, as well which though making for a somewhat more immersive game, can't hide the fact that the entire campaign feels rushed, like a last minute add-on.
The toolset is graphically powerful, quick and easy to use and though limited in the environments, creatures etc. available, this is something that will most certainly improve.  The scripting tools (the parts that create NPC interactions etc) are a different kettle of fish as you code them in what appears to be a derivative of the C programming language, not the most user friendly approach especially when compared with the graphics tools.  This disparity will no doubt encourage users to follow the same approach as Bioware took with the SP campaign and create mods based around violent encounters as they are far easier to make.  I'm sure in time the occasional Mod will arise that will do justice to the designer's original concept, but they are likely to be swamped by badly written and unbalanced slash fests.
Graphically this game is on a par with others of its ilk but does tend to suffer from shudder even on high end systems.  In this and in the woeful pathfinding the Aurora engine differs little from Bioware's previous efforts, though a special mention must be made of the appalling henchman AI (Yes it really is that bad).
All in all, this game is by far best played over a LAN with an experienced DM.  Hey, but if you had that set up you would be better of turning those computers off and playing PnP instead, as then the only limit would be your imagination, not your coding ability and the toolset.

If you are not a fan of the show, it's doubtful that you'd care for it. And even if you are a fan, it's not by any means a great game. There are simply too many drawbacks to the playability. It is, however, very respectful to the series and it does provide something which registers fairly high on the geek scale: a chance to interact with the original cast of the show, as portrayed by the actual actors. If you ever daydreamed about working cases with Grissom or getting yelled at by Katherine,  this game is your chance. And that alone, for me, was worth the pittance that it cost when I plucked it from the bargain bin at Office Depot.

You start the game as the newest CSI on the team. Grissom (William Petersen) introduces himself and explains the basics, then takes you to a homicide at a sleazy hotel and sets you loose to investigate it. This is the first of five cases you will work as separate levels on the game, each one chaperoned by a different member of the cast  Sara Sidle, Nick Stokes, Warrick Brown, and Catherine Willows, respectively. As you work the crime scene and interview witnesses at various locations, you will collect various evidence using the detection and gathering tools with which you are equipped, and then take them to CSI HQ, where Doc Robbins, Greg Sanders and Cpt. Jim Brass await you and help you process the evidence. Depending on how you choose to proceed, what you find (and what you miss), what questions you ask, etc., you will either solve the case on your own or use the help of your chaperone to crack it, whereupon you will evaluated by Grissom and sent on to the next assignment.

The pros? The game works hard to reconstruct the feeling of an actual CSI episode, using the same music and crime reconstruction cut scenes, and by keeping the characterswell, in character (Warrick is a cool cat, Sanders a smart-alleck, Nick friendly and folksy, etc.). The stories get progressively more involved and harder to solve as you move on, as well. It also rather cleverly links up a number of the seemingly unconnected stories at the end, and gives you the assignment of preventing a murder rather than solving one. Plus, as I said, you get to interact with the characters, which is undeniably funespecially since the original lineup of actors is by far my favorite (all thats missing is Ecklie to tell how how you suck at your job.)

The cons? The game is not only primitive by todays standards (actually it was somewhat primitive even for the time) but constructed very much like a tutorial, with very limited freedom of action for the player. You are equipped with a lot of bells and whistles forensically, but instead of being given freedom to fail on your own, your chaperone is constantly guiding you (unasked) by telling you what tools you won't need or cant use. The detection of evidence often comes down to button-mashing while you move your cursor around a painted screen; and analyzing the evidence, when it isn't simply done for you by Greg in the lab, requires little deductive ability. Indeed, the whole game is really more suited to collecting things and then matching them up to other things by puzzle-piecing process than actual mystery-solving. Everything is very much on a fixed track, and you have no ability to alter the outcome of the story at all. Nor is there any variation on who the killer is in the scenario, which means that once youve solved a level, you can never return to it and get a different outcome to the story; the only challenge is in performing more efficiently (getting a better rating) the next time, which isn't that hard when you know who the killer is. In a final irony, while I didn't expect great dialogue from the actors who play the witnesses and suspects (and generally wasn't disappointed), the vocal performance of William Petersen, who is an outstanding actor, is very bad: he sounds bored and slightly embarrassed. This is doubly disappointing because his castmates, especially Eric Szmanda and Paul Guilfoyle, all seem to have taken this little exercise quite seriously. That Petersen disliked the commercial exploitation of CSIs success is well known, and doubtless he didn't want to do this at all, but Im surprised such a professional actor would be content to deliver such a flat, halting performance, even if his dialogue is pretty bad. For shame, Grissom!

As I said, this game is very dated technologically, and you won't play it more than a few times at most before you cast it aside to try one of the sequels (DARK MOTIVES, for example), but my final verdict on it is still fairly positive, because if you enjoy the show  particularly the show of the first eight seasons, with the original cast  this is your chance to be a part of it.",Like being there -- almost.,1425427200,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

It was the first game to utilize a 3-D engine, and the first MK game to feature weapons combat.

While the 3-D engine was a refreshing change of pace after the stale, sprite-based animation of the previous entries, in truth MK4 gets dull rather quickly. Without the 3-D engine, it's pretty much the same as previous installments, only with less characters and less finishing moves. The idea to finally drop the silly finishers like Friendships and Babalities was a good one, but once you go through all the finishers and stage fatalities, you've pretty much seen it all. The basic fight engine is solid, but feels a little too simplistic and generic. The pre-programmed combos were toned down, which should be a good thing, but after awhile you miss the 'wow' factor that came with delivering them. The sidestepping button doesn't really do enough to change things, and weapons are so easily lost that its not worth pulling them out except for the coolness factor.

MK4's still decent and worth buying if you find a used cartridge around, but only because the N64 seriously lacked solid fighting games.

I pre-ordered this game from Target with the Wiimote/CD bundle a while back, but I've been hesitant to share my thoughts about it. Well, I'm bored, so behold!

Controls:
This was some kind of great debate when the game first came out. ""Are Skyward Sword's motion controls broken?"" was the question. I can only speak based on my own experience, and the answer is no. You have to recenter occasionally, which is rather annoying, but the actual swordplay works pretty well. I have to make a well defined arm movement to get an accurate swing, but I've spoken with gods know how many Zelda fans who say they can play the entire game by just flicking their wrists. So, one way or another, the controls do work and work well.

Music:
I think that the 'epic ballads', if you will, aren't up to par with previous entries into the franchise, but some of the music for the areas is better than usual.

Gameplay:

The dungeons in Skyward Sword are some of the best 3D Zelda has ever seen. They're certainly the high point of the game, as it should be. But just outside of those dungeons, there is a world restricted by artificial barriers that you cannot explore (until certain plot developments occur). This means you have to do these fantastic dungeons in the same order and with the same items every time you play this game. Many Zelda games have opted to employ a predefined dungeon order, but it's more noticeable (and thus more annoying) in Skyward Sword because the world is so hedged off.

There are sidequests, but most of them involve flying, perhaps lowest point of this title. There's a warp system for the world below, but to get anywhere, you need to spend two to ten minutes flying through the air to get to it. The sky itself is a desolate place filled with nothing, save a few Goddess Cube puzzles. And this is particularly atrocious because the sky is the only real area you can explore in the game.

Story:

It's pretty good. Some characters are a little cheesy, but that's to be expected.

Replayability:

Most Zelda games either allow enough freedom to do things differently on subsequent runs through or they give you a warp system to skip past endless travel. Skyward Sword doesn't really do either since the warp system still requires you to ride Sky-Epona to your destination. So, there's endless flying coupled with a quest that allows you no freedom of choice whatsoever (And the second phase of the game could have easily allowed some choices on where to go.). The replay value is kind of average, in that it's not really there.

I wouldn't count Twilight Princess as being one of my favorite Zelda games, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that I find it to be vastly superior to Skyward Sword. If you have a Wii and are looking for an adventure about elven heroes saving princesses, why not check the much cheaper Twilight Princess out before spending 50-70 bucks on this title?",Skyward Something,1330041600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have always prized the extremely high quality and durability of every piece of Nintendo hardware I have owned over the years, no one does it better in my opinion. I did not hesitate to pre-order a launch system for Christmas, Nintendo's hardware is generally bulletproof. I figured Nintendo's quality testing is so high, the Wii U would be immune to the widespread launch failures that plagued the Xbox 360 (RROD) and original PS3 (YLOD), etc. Therefore, I was shocked and disappointed when I set up my kids new Wii U and the gamepad (not the console) started freezing every 15-20 seconds. I did the initial update (took forever), it did not help a bit. I spent countless, frustrating hours trying every fix on the planet, nothing worked. When I went online to see if anyone else was having the same issue, I quickly discovered that many users were experiencing the same defect, it wasn't limited to just my unit. Nintendo's support was of no help, the only solution is to mail it back for repair. Seriously? I just spent about $500 on the console, games and accessories and now I have to pack it up in a box, bring it to a UPS store, ship it off and wait for 2 weeks and hope the repaired/replaced unit actually works? What kind of crap is that? Try explaining to your young kids that their prized new Christmas gift now needs to be mailed away for a few weeks and they can't play the new Skylanders Giants game they have been excitedly waiting months for. I have been burned as an early adopter before (it comes with the territory sometimes), but I hereby vow to NEVER be an early adopter again, this is the last launch console I am ever buying (regardless of brand). I will wait a few months until they get all the bugs worked out, let other people deal with the headaches. I recommend avoiding the Wii U for a couple of months until all the hardware/software bugs are worked out and all the defective launch stock is sold off the shelves. I realize that many launch units are working fine, but based on what I read from so many other people online having the same issues, such a significant failure rate is an absolutely unacceptable quality problem (even for my beloved Nintendo). Getting a new console is supposed to be a fun, exciting experience for the whole family, not a frustrating and sad disappointment.  Sorry Nintendo, you guys really dropped the ball on this one.
**UPDATE 12/31/2012: I convinced the retailer to exchange the defective unit for a replacement, the new unit works perfectly, kids are happy.  At this time, I would only recommend purchasing this item from a retail store that will give you a prompt, hassle-free exchange if you get a lemon.  When the console works, it is amazing, love it.  Since I am a sucker for Nintendo, I raised my original 1 star rating to 3 stars (would have been a perfect 5 stars if the first one wasn't a lemon).","Launch Console Defective, Needs Repair Right out of the Box.",1356825600,4,,

I love COH and enjoy playing the single player campaigns and playing online. I do not think COH:TOV is worth the original purchase price and probably should have been a free mod and not a full release. I have outlined the new content in COH:TOV below. At the current price I would recommend it for those who play online, but not someone who likes campaigns. I got a whole lot more content from a free mod called Eastern Front which has a new Russian fraction. Search google for Company of Heroes Russian to find it. The only downfall with the Russian mod is that very few players have it so online play is limited.

COH:TOV comes with three new campaigns, some alternate unit options, and some different multiplayer modes of play. The new campaigns include: Tiger Ace where you are a German Tiger commander in the battle of Villers-Bocage shortly after D-Day. Causeway where you control 82nd Airborne troops fighting around La Fiere Causeway on D-Day. Falaise Pocket where you as the Germans defend against the allies trying to close the pocket after the American breakout with Operation Cobra. The campaigns are short and represent about half the content in the previous games. This is disappointing. I will say that I did enjoy the first two campaign (Falaise Pocket plays almost like a Stonewall game and seemed tedious to me). They do not follow the traditional Company Commander System. Instead of picking a specialty, you can select new abilities and many of them affect only a single hero unit. The direct fire system has also been added, but I did not like it much. The stories that these campaigns follow are pretty well known.

The new units in COH:TOV replace existing units from the previous games. You can select which units you want to use and which ones to leave unchanged. Each of the four armies get two units. For the Americans, you get T17 armored car which is a heavier variant replacing M8 armored car and M18 Hellcat which is heavier armored but less armor penetration than the M10 tank destroyer it replaces. By the way, it is not a plane as described in the Amazon product description. For the British, you get the Kangaroo Carrier which can hold several infantry units and is pretty tough. However, it replaces the Cromwell Tank leaving you limited armored options. You also get the Staghound armored car which is similar to T17 which replaces the Cromwell Tank Commander. This gives you easier access to the Firefly, however, you no longer can get veterancy for tanks. For the Wehrmacht, the motorcycle can be replaced by Schwimmwagen 166. It can ford rivers. I usually don't use this vehicle. The Stug can also be replaced by Geschutzwagen H39 which is an motorized anti-tank gun. However, I prefer the Stug for superior infantry attack and better armor. For the Panzer Elite, you also get a Schwimmwagen variant, but this one is unarmored and can't camouflage like the Kettenkrad. I don't like it. The Hotchkiss can replace the Panzer IV. The Hotchkiss is pretty weak, but it can provide mobile artillery support when upgraded. Basically, it depends on player styles whether you will like the new units.

The new multiplater modes do add some additional fun, but somewhat short lived. All the new modes can only be played as the American or the Germans.

The style of fighting they used in this game and the powers you can use while doing so are generally fun and enjoyable the first time you play.  You might get tired of it after a while.  It lasted me a few hours or so.

But anyways, it's not a bad little game overall.  Just one problem, though.  Lots of people in gaming magazines and such have been referring to this as a ""Dragon Ball Z"" RPG.  Yeah, right.  Donkey Kong 64 was as much an RPG as this game was.  Basically, they have you collect ""health capsules"" and ""ki capsules"" across several stages while fighting off hordes of bad guys.  Collect ten health capsules and your max health will increase.  Collect ten ki capsules and your max ki (like DBZ mana) will increase.  Other than this, the only rpg-like element in the game is the move-earning, and not really that much.  There are about 19-20 power-ups you can earn, most of which don't impact your style of fighting too much, though a few (like teleportation) do help to keep it fresh on your first play-through.  But Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3 was more of an RPG than this game BY FAR.  At least it had experience points.  The fighting was also better in that game by far.

Now, I did give this game a fair shot, and I'm a big fan of Dragon Ball Z, but as a fan, I'd like to see an ACTUAL DBZ RPG that will fulfill the potential of a Dragon Ball Z game.  By this I mean training = gaining experience.  Use weights/increased gravity to gain more experience, start out weak enough that frieza can kill you in one hit and slowly work your way up to his level and beyond (you know, like in the series!)  Seriously, I can't be the only person who realizes that most of DBZ does not consist of fighting or exploring, but of training (gaining experience) and trembling in fear of an enemy strong enough to kill you in one swift motion.

It has its own merits, and its own shortcomings, but does not seem particularly related to previous games and must be considered more as a stand-alone game.

The story of the game involves a doomsday cult trying to summon an ancient evil using Edward Carnby, the private detective and protagonist from Alone in the Dark (the original), who has been brought to the present by unknown means and has amnesia. At first, the evil presence (marked by glowing cracks in walls that move and seek out prey as if alive) is limited to a single building, but it quickly spreads throughout the entirety of New York City, leaving Edward trapped in Central Park.

As far as stories go, this is a decent one for a survival horror game, and there are a lot of good scares and surprises. In the beginning, you're trapped in a building where the very walls are trying to get you, and in addition you're also dealing with zombies - people swallowed up by the cracks brought back as malicious outlets for the main demon to speak and act through. The main demon's voice is kind of bad, though - it's the same deep monster voice that has basically become a cliche in movies about demons, and it makes the glowing cracks go from ""unidentified, unintelligent, but malicious entity"" to ""scary-voiced demon guy"". In fact, as far as scares go, the main problem with Alone in the Dark is that you're so rarely alone. Besides the short-lived survivors you encounter throughout the game, you also have a sidekick, Sarah, who comes and goes throughout parts of the game. Well, ""sidekick"" is a bit generous, since there's not a lot of cooperative gameplay involved. But the point is that there's no feeling of isolation; it's more like a disaster movie that happens to have monsters in it.

The standard gameplay is a fairly regular survival-horror control system. The game is normally played in third-person, with somewhat awkward tank-style controls (IE you have to walk, then turn, then walk, rather then just turning while you walk). The camera in particular is hard to manage, and trying to look around while moving or anything besides walking in a straight line was pretty difficult to manage. Aiming firearms is done exclusively in first-person, but melee combat has a bit of a unique twist to it - it's done in third person like normal gameplay segments, and swinging melee weapons is done by ""swinging"" the right thumbstick from one direction to another. This works pretty well in most cases, and it changes depending on the weapon being used. For example, with long weapons like 2x4s or swords, you only have the option to swing horizontally or vertically. However, with heavier items like fire extinguishers, you can also use the item as a battering ram to smash down doors.

Most of the enemies in the game can only be temporarily defeated by weapons, and must be consumed by fire to be fully destroyed. To this end, innovating ways to use fire as a weapon is one of the most important parts of the game. The most basic form of this is to light a melee weapon on fire by sticking it into the flames; the flames don't last forever, but they're an instant-kill to most of the monsters that you'll face, and the enemy cowers and flees accordingly. In fact, I would say that swinging a burning 2x4 while your formerly aggressive zombie enemies cower and flee before you is probably the most satisfying part of the game. There are other methods as well that must be thought up with more open thinking - things like molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers made out of a can of hair spray and a match. While the ""make weapons out of things to defeat your foes"" aspect is pretty much limited to fire, the fact that fire is what destroys your enemies makes it at least plausible.

Your inventory in the game is represented by the holsters and pouches in your jacket. The left side of your jacket is used for small items like boxes of ammo or batteries, there's a holster for a gun and a flashlight on your chest, and the right side is used for bottles and cans of various types. The fact that there's a legitimate, actual inventory (you actually look down in first-person to access it, and it's in real-time too so you have to hurry and put stuff together instead of just calmly making a molotov cocktail during a pause) helps with the atmosphere that's being created. In a similar manner, wounds show up on your body and must be healed with either bandages or a first-aid spray. There's no health bar (as with the inventory, all HUD elements are minimal in this game), but you can get a general idea of how injured you are by the status of your wounds (which are still present after being healed, but aren't red and open). You also get a phone/PDA at a point in the game that allows you to make calls and gives you access to a GPS map of the area you are in.

In many situations it's necessary to hotwire a car or activate a fusebox (which is done in real time, often with monsters closing in on you) by picking the right wires to spark together. You're often frantically pressing wires together hoping that they're the right ones but doing it quickly enough to get away from the monsters closing in on your car. This is a pretty good part of the game in an atmospheric sense. Driving the car is another thing, though; the controls are wonky and in most cases the demands of the game as far as getting away from giant apocalyptic cracks in the road are a little bit over-the-top. I spent a good hour on what is really a five-minute segment where you're trying to get away from a giant series of cracking roads and earthquakes because the car didn't turn enough, or it turned too much, or I hit another motorist and the car got stuck, or I hit something at a bad angle. The last one in particular is annoying; at the end of the sequence in question, you're supposed to go flying out through a window in a building, but the first time I got there, I assumed that was what was supposed to happen, but I hit it at an odd angle and I didn't go through (I left a mark on the glass though). The next two times I made it there, I tried looking around for other exits but got blocked off. Only on the last time did I realize what had happened and just drive straight into the glass.

The graphics in the game are pretty good; the best graphics are the fire graphics, which flicker and dance pretty realistically, while the worst are probably the wounds that Edward receives on his body. The idea's neat, but in actuality they're just the same image copy-pasted onto different parts of his body. The ""slash that ripped through cloth and pierced the skin"" image looks okay when it's on his pants or shirt, but when it's on his jacket it just looks like someone slapped it on like a sticker. Also, you get the same kind of wound no matter how you got the injury. Overall, though, the graphics are decent and atmospheric.

The sound isn't bad, but the music just feels wrong. It's a nice attempt at atmospheric music, but most of the time it's not so much ""scary"" as it is ""epic"", with giant sweeping musical interludes and ominous chanting that fits more with ""Carmina Burana"" than a horror movie. It just feels overstated, and not particularly scary. Furthermore, it gets old pretty quickly, too.

As a whole, the worst part of Alone in the Dark is its execution. It has a lot of good ideas, and most of the elements taken by themselves are pretty sound. However, the actual execution of the ideas - the controls, the situation, the atmosphere - are all really terrible and frustrating, and the game seems more like a battle against the game itself than against any monsters or puzzles. The interactive environments seem more linear than natural; despite the fact that it's supposed to be stuff that's done in a manner that makes it seem ""realistic"", there's so many scripted sequences that it's hard to get into it.

As a whole, Alone in the Dark deserves a 6/10 - good ideas, but poor execution.",Good Ideas - Poor Execution,1224547200,4,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

I finished the game and to be honest I'm glad it's over.  Not only is it a little more difficult than the last game, it has lots of glitches and problems.
The GOOD:
Music is okay, some of the graphics are better, the fighting is better with more moves, lots of new one liners, action figures, more comic books, new villains, dialogue options, new costumes, some good voice acting, new side missions, an okay story, some great cut scenes, and best of all MORE STAN LEE!
The BAD:
The character designs are hit and miss -some are good, some are awful (like why does Cletus Kassidy look like Ron from Harry Potter, and why is Harry Osborn a blonde?), the one liners get really old because HE NEVER STOPS TALKING, constant verbal reminders of the main objective even during long side missions, the game is pretty short, some bad voice acting, a more complicated and annoying web slinging system, long annoying cut scenes before and after every single side mission, the web rush mode barely functions at all this time, completely revamped stealth that also completely sucks, side missions that disappear if you can't get to this in a matter of seconds, serious camera issues, a radar sense that sometimes just makes things more confusing, several long boring cut scenes, stupidly long loading times, the dodge system doesn't always work, random glitches where you'll inexplicably lose your ability to 'web pull', punch, swing, or dodge, an inability to aim the webs you're shooting, offensive fat jokes, lots of weird jerky movements from Spider-Man during cut scenes, and did I mention HE NEVER STOPS TALKING!
You have to have a LOT of patience if you're going to play this game because the many glitches will get very frustrating very fast.  I'm a Spider-man fanatic so I had to check this game out.  It's in the contract.  I was immediately disappointed (and downright terrified at times) of the character designs.  Some are good, some are bad, but for for frak sake Aunt May doesn't even look human!  Still I don't play games for the graphics.  The stealth system is what bothered me the most though.  I loathe stealth, but I love it in the first Amazing Spider-man game.  There you can take guys down with great stealth moves and if you get caught then so be it.  You can web escape or fight your way out.  Here if you get seen by anyone at anytime it's over.  Start from the very beginning of the stage.  Crap.  Also you have to be in very close, very specific positions to do a stealth takedown.  And if your seen it's over.  The stealth in this game is awful and there's really no point in using it unless you happen to be in the right position at the right time.
Next the side mission.  There are tons of them.  Many also have an inexcusable time limit.  If one shows up on your map and start flashing red (especially if it's on the other side of the city) you will not make it in time!  You get penalized for this a lot.  If there are three of four side missions that start flashing red simultaneously and you can't get to them in time you get penalized a lot.  You'll also be under constant attack from the new police enforcers because of your 'manace meter'. It's complicated and stupid.  If you're a completionist you should know there is no possible way to complete all of the objectives and side missions.  This entire system sucks!!!
And the web rush system.  Just wow.  Perfect in the first game and here it only works about half the time.  I can't even begin to tell you how frustratingly glitched and awful the web rush mode is.  Oh, and the new, complicated web slinging is almost as bad.
Over all I liked the some of the new villains, there were some nice cut scenes and funny lines, and a really good free comic book.  The fighting was fun too for the most part.  I'm glad I played it just to see, but I wondered after it was done if it was really worth it.  This was just a rental and maybe that's all it should be.
If you're a Spider-Man fan like me it's worth a shot, but know what you're getting into.  Don't expect it to work well, and don't be surprised when things don't work at all.  It really deserves only two and a half stars, but three will have to do.

""Alaskan Storm"" gameplay can be pretty repetitive and slow. When setting your pots to fish, it seems like it takes forever! (If this happened on the show Capt. Phil Harris would be pitching a fit!!)Most likely I'm spoiled by the TV show and the magic of editing. I'm sure setting the pots is a much more drawn out process than what we see on the TV show, and I guess the game kind of captures that. And while the gameplay is a bit slow...it can be kind of addictive. (As an old-school gamer I kind of relate it to Intellivision's ""Utopia""...God am I old!!) Depending on the weather, setting pots can be kind of tough, as you want to make them easily retrievable, or as close to a straight line as possible. In storms you will be battling huge waves, currents and other boats in the area, so there is some challenge....just very slow paced. So, while the gameplay can be slow at times, it's still fun.

The other main complaint is the amount of miniscule text you have to read while playing. I agree completely with this complaint. There is simply too much to read during gameplay. For the XBOX 360 you would expect sound bites, and like ""Dead Rising"", the amount of text does affect the gameplay, and to make it worse, the text is soooooo small as to make it almost unreadable! If a sequel ever comes out for ""Deadliest Catch"" that is the one big thing I would change.

Still, if you like your games to flow at a slower pace, you may want to give ""Deadliest Catch"" a chance.

I have been debating whether or not to purchase this game since it was release and I finally bought it a few days ago.  I haven't played it much during this time period, so bear with me I may update this after further game playing.  First off let me warn those out there that have an aging computer system, don't get this game without first getting a new computer you will probably not have a good experience with this game.  So if your not planning on upgrading to a Pentium 4 system, I would stick with 3000 Unlimited, great graphics or not, it is not worth having multiple headaches from technical problems and computer crashes.
Comparing this purchase to the one(6 months ago) that I bought the SimCity 3000 Unlimited, I have to say that I haven't played this one as much. Which can be due to a couple of factors: one being I don't have as much time now as I did then.  Another reason is I was already familiar on what it needs to make a ""successful"" city, or at least I thought so.
This version of the game seems to me harder, even if they give you more money to work with.  However I guess that inflation has hit Sim City (I guess that Sim Nation's economy is taking a hit like our real world).  The monuments and famous land marks are no longer free, and they put a dent in your City's budget.  In fact other things seem more expensive with this game including the price of it.  I would have to take out loans to be able to pay for my other loan payments...which on average would cost about S 30,000 per fiscal year...kind of hard to do when you have a city income of about S 1,500.  Needless to say that I have been impeached sooner with this version then the last:)
However not all is bad, the graphics are great and it is cool seeing the Sims actually building. Some complaints that I had about the old version were: difficult to get farms and seaports started.  This is resolved in this version as is my problem with the airport zoning.  For both the airports and seaports they are prefabricated in this game...meaning they are more expensive to build and maintain, but at least it looks nice.  As for as the farm or argiculture zoning...they are specifically zoned for no longer do you have the chance of factories building on the low industrial zones.  In the ""god"" mode of the game (before you switch to mayor mode) there is more options to how you want the geography of your city, plus you can put animals such as horses and deer.  Once you have switched to mayor mode, you can go back to god mode, but your options are reduced.  There are new disasters, a giant Servo on the loose to distory parts of the city.  As for the option to play with your Sims... Let's just say that this feature will need some work.  The most that you do with your Sims is move them into their first house.  They do give feed back as to what your doing wrong and what is going right for them.  I had one Sim complain that she didn't like having to drag her kids across town to school.
So over all I am ho-hum about Sim City 4, but not totally disappointed with my purchase.  I recommend this game if you have (1) a fairly new system <1 year old (2) if you thought that playing the odler versions were to one dementional, with the Sims living in your city they give you feedback, and let you know what it is like to live there.

Excellence through simplicity: Final Fantasy games over the years have gotten a rep for being too complex for their own good sometimes, often being so much so that it takes away from some aspects of the game itself. This game doesn't do that, rather letting its gameplay and story shine on its own merits without tons of flashy distractions.

A style all its own: This game doesn't try to copy other Final Fantasy games, it doesn't try to be that distant sequel to FF2 (or any other FF game) that we never got or never asked for, even with the similarities that can be drawn to other games through the crown system. For that reason the strength in the art style comes through in the way that some familiar enemies from the series are still recognizable while characters and enemies we've never seen before are able to stand find on their own.

Crown System: The crown system equals flexibility, giving you a wide range of things you can do with any one of your characters as long as you've upgraded their crowns.

Challenge: The game might look like, and even start out as, child's play, but once you really get into the beef of things you'll find yourself having to think more then your used to about party make up and skill sets, which for many will be a welcome addition to a genre that many people consider (lately) to be far too easy on its fans.

Extra Dungeons: The extra challenge dungeons you can unlock through the game are.. well, for lack of a better term, challenging. But I found them fun enough to give me a run for my money while being completely random and different (and thus fun) each time I tried to tackle them, even when I failed.

Cons:
Character marry-go-round: This was a fairly big con to me. It might be a spoiler in a sense so be warned **SPOILER** that you don't really end up with all your party members together in one place till almost the end of the game. This does make for an interesting story but to me made me yearn hard for when everyone would be together so I could be at ""full strength"". At the same time this also means you couldn't quite count on which upgraded crowns you'd have with you at any given time, since each crown is upgraded per the person and the characters would weave in and out like a prize fighter. With the game being named ""The 4 Heroes of Light"" you'd just sort of figure those heroes would have been together much more then just (maybe not even)a quarter of the game.

Crown System: Yes, this is a con as much as its a pro. The flaw I found with the crown system was that even if you figured out how to farm up a lot of gems you'd need to still be very wise with how you used many of them, since the rarer gems are still pretty rare, which leaves you hoping that you spent the right gems, on the right person for that crown (which isn't ever very clear), and to be sure **SPOILER** that person with that crown will be with you in the next section of the game.

The other big flaw to the system I found was that you could go through most of the game without really touching your crowns, only to have to upgrade -maybe- one crown to get through the tougher battles. And then some of the crowns you get throughout the game, regardless of when you get them, may never really get used because others are way WAY more useful throughout the game.

Challenge: Yep, another pro that's also a con. The challenge is great, but as I also mentioned just above, you can manage to make it through a good portion of the game with next to no upgrades to your crowns only to be completely stumped as to why your having so much trouble with just one boss that happens to crop up, then be lead to further wonder just which crown/skill should be the one for the situation. It comes as an all too sudden spike in difficulty that will make many players want to put the game down for a night or two.

The problem with the difficulty is that the game doesn't hold your hand, which sounds like a good thing, specially since its part of the reason I named it a pro, but the issue it forms is how little explanation you've been given for even the smallest things, like which characters are better with physical crowns or which ones should be spell casters (good luck remembering the short, not so detailed, descriptions hours later) and don't bet on understanding the ins and outs of a crowns abilities without way to much trial and error (or a faq), and a lot of wasted gems when even the smallest bit of extra description would have done wonders to help the player out.

Overall, Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light is a great little game that will keep you occupied for a while, providing you with an experience that will give you more then enough value for the money you've spent. Sure, the lack of description and some of the sudden difficulty spikes that will lead to a lot of seemingly unnecessary trial and error, will find a way to frustrate players but if you can find your way around those flaws you will see the simple gem that lies underneath and feel fulfilled at the journey's end.",Worthy of the Final Fantasy Name,1311206400,,,

A little history.  Lots of people when they were little played games like Mario and played many hours.  Most people finished these games once or twice and moved on.  Some people played the games until they had them memorized and redid everything until they had every coin.  They continued playing a game long after their friends had quit to max everything out.  These people are called hardcore.  Unfortunately for everyone else on the planet, apparently only Hardcore gamers grow up to be game makers, except for a few other that have all been captured by Nitendo and are allowed to make games that are just fun and nothing else.

The problem with the hardcore is they mistake repetitive challenge for ""fun"", when for most people it quickly becomes tedium.  This is the primary problem with LittleBigPlanet.  From the very beginning the hardcore roots are there, with the need to procure the building blocks for your own levels by finding secret places and accomplishing extra hard feats.  Its not clear why these are even linked?

Why should I have to even play the single player levels to unlock things in the building phase?  This just reeks of hardcore game design that makes no sense.

Well, the first few levels are great and fun with appropriate challenge, but the longer you play the more you run into hardcore levels and challenge that turn casual ""I want to have fun not work"" gamers off.  It turns into tedium.

Long ago game makers would make you start levels over if you missed a jump.  Soon it was realized that was horrible and un-fun.  No one told Media Molecule.  Are you cruising on a level and doing great and then get to a hard part and miss a jump 5 times - well its time to start the level over!  This is inexcusable in a modern game.  Rachet and Clank and Drakes Uncharted save the game before difficult areas, and you can redo them a million times without starting a level over.  Why?  Because they are not making games in the 1980s and realized making you replay the easy parts 10 times to redo the hard parts is retarded and boring and makes people write reviews about your game and how you emphasize the lame parts.

Hardcore platformers are acceptable if the controls are up to it, but this is the final strike against LittleBigPlanet, the controls are mushy and don't respond consistently.

Now, someone could say I just suck at games, and maybe that is true, but that just emphasizes I want fun and reasonable challenge in my games, not tedium and game design from 1980.  Some might say - well, make your own levels.  And I would, but I am locked out of half the materials because I am not hardcore.

Sadly in the end, LittleBigPlanet is cute and loveable, but deeply flawed as a fun game.

UPDATE: In April 2009 the game was updated to have infinite level spawns, making it much more group and family friendly.  Additionally, the online modules continue to be top-notch and raise the score of the game by themselves.",A tedious hardcore game pretending to be casual,1229299200,17,,

The only thing that kind of bugged me is that it didn't come in a box, just a sealed bag.  Also, when I first took them out of the package and tilted the headset, it sounds like a screw has come loose in the left earphone.  I figure maybe putting things in boxes might help such damage from occurring.

Otherwise, the headset works well.  We'll have to see how long it lasts.  Like everything, it's probably designed to self-destruct in time.  Planned obsolescence is our economic strategy.

I got tired of being attacked having to focus my flash light for about 5 seconds on each taken and than unload 3 shots into him. You can only run in the dark flashing a flashlight around.

Normally a mouse would last me around 3-4 years before needing to be replaced, this one, however, had to be replaced via warranty within the first year, then the replacement also had problems. When I tried to get a 2nd replacement Logitech was trying to make me jump through ridiculous hoops, like taking a picture of the mouse while it's not working etc... I said forget it and ordered one more from Amazon, and within the first 30 days, I started having issues with the buttons. Thankfully Amazon has an amazing return policy and I was able to get a new one right away. Once my current mouse develops a problem I will be done it with and Logitech for good.

It's better than grabbing my watch (which I'm not usually wearing) or looking at my phone. I have found absolutely no use for the LCD screen otherwise and the only reason I bought it was because I needed to replace my broken keyboard and Logitech.com had a dented box deal (50% off, free shipping). I use Fraps for FPS display, since it can record and take screenshots as well.

This keyboard is pretty much similar to the one I replaced, a G11, except that mine is the 2nd edition with less macro keys and orange lighting. I don't particularly like the orange, but of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I much prefer the blue.

I'm not a big RTS or RPG player either and can't seem to find a good use for the macro keys. I've set them up to control Skype, but that's about it. If you play either of these genre's you may find more use for them, but I don't use a lot of macro keys.

Now that I've gotten the bad stuff out of the way, the keyboard is actually pretty good. I like illuminated keys, they are great for gaming at night when I'd prefer to have the lights off. I also like the media and volume controls, something I require from any keyboard I usually buy. My headset pretty much has all these controls but it's nice to have them on a keyboard as well, in case the headset didn't. The LCD screen also shows that track you are playing and the current volume when ever you adjust it, which is one other nice thing about the screen.

There is a slider on this keyboard that switches ""gaming mode"" on a off. All this does is disable the Windows key so if you accidentally hit it whilst in a game, it doesn't minimize the game. You may think this is useless at first, until the day you actually hit the Windows key by accident ;) The backlit keys can also be turned off too, though I prefer to leave it on.

Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX represents Acclaim's attempt to cash in on the extreme sports phenomenon started by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and, as a result, the basic game mechanics should seem very familiar to fans of the skateboarding game. To its credit, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX introduces some new elements to the extreme sports subgenre. Unfortunately, the game has a number of both major and minor flaws. Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX's options are typical of an extreme sports game. The proquest mode is essentially a career mode that lets you select from a lineup of the world's best BMX freestylists to play as. It also lets you earn new sponsored clothing, new levels, and new bikes. Each track has a series of objectives that start at an amateur difficulty level and then steadily increase in difficulty after you complete them. In fact, the default bike just isn't good enough for accomplishing some of the later, more difficult objectives, so there is substantial incentive for obtaining faster and more maneuverable bikes. Even so, the proquest mode may be a little too easy for extreme sports veterans, since the game visibly highlights the obstacles associated with objectives you need to complete. However, this should be a welcome feature for those who are new to the genre. The game's two remaining modes - freeride and session - are practice modes in which you can race around on a track, with or without a time limit. Unfortunately, these modes are mostly worthless for practicing in, since some tracks - particularly the backyard pools area - constantly change as new areas open up and as you complete more objectives. The gameplay in Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX is solid, if perhaps lacking in originality. Just as in Tony Hawk, pressing a series of button combinations makes you perform tricks on your bike. The more complicated your combination is, the more points you receive. Unfortunately, even executing the simplest trick isn't as easy as it should be. The first problem is that when you're facing the camera, you have to press ""up"" to turn your bike around. In theory, it's the ideal way to address camera problems, but in practice, the sluggish controls really prevent this maneuver from being useful. Another minor problem is the game's collision detection. Most of the time, it's easy to judge your distance from the ground or from an obstacle, which makes trick execution ideal. However, there are times when your bike seems to clearly miss an obstacle, but you'll still crash as though you ran right into it. The inconsistent collision detection also becomes a problem when you attempt to perform grinds - sometimes your bike can connect with an obstacle from an unrealistic distance, and other times, you need to be very precise and land right on the object you want to grind. Visually, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX is on par with other multiplatform ports of extreme sports games. A few impressive textures appear here and there, like on the various riders' helmets, but the rest of them are fairly bland and pixelated. The bike rider models are not incredibly detailed, but there are enough subtle differences to help you recognize the differences among each of the riders. Oddly enough, even though the various environments and the character models are essentially taken straight from the PlayStation version of the game, slowdown and drops in frame rate can still be a major problem in areas with numerous objects. The slowdown usually dissipates after a second or two, but it can affect gameplay, especially if you want to perform a complicated trick in a detailed area during the last seconds of the round. The game has plenty of other small visual problems as well, like the crash animations. Since there are no pre-scripted crash animations, your rider will just go flying like a limp rag doll whenever you hit something. It's humorous at times; however, it's generally very awkward and unrealistic.
Other than the proquest mode, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX doesn't have much else to offer. There are no multiplayer modes, which is unfortunate since most of the latest extreme sports games have found ways to incorporate different types of multiplayer modes, either online or on a single computer. In the end, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX can be fun, but the occasional problems with the graphics and collision detection can quickly become a source of unnecessary frustration.",Mediocre title,1063065600,4,,

I've always been a big fan of fighting games, particularly when they can bring some goofy and innovative combat moves. And while I will always retain a soft spot for the original side-to-side fighters like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat (and even Karate Champ, if you really want to go old school), the games that allow for more three dimensional fighting have far more appeal to me these days.

DOA has become notorious for certain female body characteristics, but aside from that, it has historically had some pretty fun fighting gameplay, with some good combos and interesting level designs.

Already owning DOA 5 on the 360, I didn't really expect a ton of new things out of this version, but I was hoping for a little bit more than just graphical enhancements.  Don't get me wrong, the game does look pretty amazing.  The enhancements are mostly pretty subtle, but add a lot to the visuals.  However, for the premium price initially charged at launch, I would have hoped for something extra to justify the ""brand new game"" price.

Now that the price has gone down, and if you don't expect much new, this is a pretty decent port over to the Xbox One.  But given that it's been confirmed that a DOA 6 is being developed specifically for next gen consoles, it might be worth just waiting.","Ok game, but brings little new to the Xbox One",1424217600,28,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have played all series beside the first one, transplant from SFC to PS without reformat the look and system.... I was not interested into playing it.

I was on the same side as all gamers above me, this game is really BORING and RIDICULOUS.

About BORING: The designer probably did not pay attention to other famous games in the past 3 years, which had the same issue --- EXCITING IN THE BEGINNING, AND THEN AFTER THE FIRST 3 CHAPTERS, BORING REPEAT MODE UNTIL THE END. To prove: Just recall when you played the previous series, how many times you were asked to fight in the same map and the same enemies for over 4 times? I DO NOT recall any one version asked the players to play in this situation more then 2 or 3 times. However, in Assault Horizon, you are asked to strike the same pattern of enemies again and again for about 5 or 6 times. Like in the mission in Moscow and Dubai, you have to beat the same pattern of Enemies again and again and again......  the only difference is the location.

About Ridiculous: I am good in the previous series, maybe not excellent, but at least can finish the difficult of ""ACE of ACE."" However, in this assault horizon, the final boss, I can hit is 8 times with missals and gun shot many time, it JUST not able to be killed. I spent more then 6 hours in the past weekend and kept failed on the very last mission just because it cannot be killed. The difficulty I played was only Pilot, which was recommend for people who had experience.......yeah...I had experience, and all missions were only rank C and D and then the final boss was unbeatable.

The story line ....I do not want to compare to other games as I do not remember their names so clear now...yes..because not worthy to remember, so I do not remember......  the story line is very .....FAIL. I cannot believe the American writer wrote such bad story. Why not just ask the original Japanese writers to make the story?  If no more stories can be made up, then just end the series at the ""Fires of Liberation,"" instead ruin this super title.

The art directors did a great job keeping the feel of the show, and the video inbetweens (cinematics) are really good. In fact, getting to see the next one is incentive to keep playing. And while the in-game graphics obviously aren't as polished as the pre-rendered parts, they're still pretty good, staying true to the cartoon. The opening mix of gameplay and cinematics is very dramatic.
The controls could be better. Particularly when you're flying the batplane or driving the batmobile. In fact, the batplane section, so far, has been the weakest part of the game for me, with the batmobile/car chase a close second. Plus, running around QUAKE-style, shooting bat-a-rangs is a little boring.
Some of the in-game directions could use work, too. Some objectives aren't particularly clear at first...they should have tested the gameplay on people who didn't work on it.
My hope is that response will be strong enough for a streamlined sequel, with better overall controls, deeper fighting combinations, and the ability to bat-grapple wherever you'd like. The game isn't particularly hard, and it felt kinda lame beating up Mr. Freeze's thungs, who are all young women! (...who manage to be tougher than Joker's big thugs).

I wish there were more songs, and also that you could get a particular genre or style of music - the play list is really diverse and there are only about 6 songs I can sing really well. Of course it's a party bundle and Karaoke is supposed to be about singing badly and having a good time with friends so it does do that very well.

3.0,True,"01 11, 2011",A3G5MOHY1U635N,B003QTEBYI,Eagle Eyes,"I purchased Nintendo DSi XL 20 in 1 Starter Kit - Bronze for my red DSi XL.  I like the protective case and all items included except game cases.

The case seems to provide sufficient protection for the console.  DSi XL fits well in the case, but needs to be removed for playing.  There are two elastic straps to hold DSi XL inside the case, and one of them is already fraying at one end after just twelve days of use.

Wrist straps and styli are of good quality and small styli fit well and securely into the DSi's stylus storage space.  Wrist straps are too short for me.  There is no way I can have the wrist strap on my wrist and play the DSi XL at the same time.  The DSI XL's strap hook is located at the rear of the console and a little to the right.  The wrist strap is way to short to be placed on my left wrist (to keep the right one available for the stylus strap) and a little short for my right wrist.

The charging stand has a very bright blue light that glows with or without DSi in the charging stand, and no way of turning it off or placing a piece of tape to prevent it from shining.  This is absolutely unnecessary and gimmicky in my opinion; the light is so bright that it illuminates a room at night, and reminds me of some annoying bluetooth headsets with bright blue light.  In addition, there is no left-to-right guide to assist with placing the console so that it connects to the charger.  I often find myself sliding the console from side to side to align the charging connector in the stand with the charging socket in the console.  I feel like the metal connector is scratching the back of the console, although I can see no marks on the back of my system.  Still, I would prefer some guide to just drop the console in the right place.

The game cases are a real disappointment because they are not transparent but a solid brown color so you cannot see what cartridge is inside.  I don't know if this was an engineering oversight or a cost cutting measure, but it seems like it would be an obvious and logical choice to make cartridge cases out of clear plastic rather than blindly maintain the brown color theme.

Overall, the carrying case is OK, and the charging stand and the non-transparent game cases are frustrating so I am rating this kit three stars which means just OK.

UPDATE:  Three weeks later one end of one of the elastic straps separated from the case.  Amazon is replacing, but by looking at the straps that broke I see that the ends are not finished and if it starts fraying, it will eventually separate.  I think that a better way to secure a DSI XL inside this case would be velcro straps, but elastic straps were probably cheaper.

UPDATE:  This company has some quality control issues.  The replacement kit I received had THREE protectors (#1) for one screen and ONE protector (#2) for another, when it is supposed to be TWO of each.

UPDATE:  The second kit is better. The straps in the case are holding well and are not breaking.  I used a utility knife to cut windows in game cases and now I can see what's inside.  Still, considering the quality/design issues at this the price, I'll put the rating back to 3 stars.","It's OK for the console protection, but some frustrating issues",1294704000,,,

Since then, I've ssen them evolve into something I never could have imagined. It seems the general consensus around harcore MK fans is, the newer 3D ones are disappointing and in some respects, I'll agree but there are some things are an improvement. Anyway, not to go off on a tangent here...

MK vs. DC sounds like a great idea (after it sinks in for awhile). When I imagined how it would look and what the gameplay would be like, a smile came across my face but that might have been my own undoing with this game. I imagined a brutal gore fest where Scorpion is impaling Batman with his spear and tearing him in half, Baraka is chopping Wonder Woman to pieces with his blades, Superman is melting Liu Kang into a gooey, bloody pool with his heat vision and The Flash is hitting Jax so hard and so fast that his limbs, head and other body parts start flying off of him one by one.

Unfortunately, the result was actually a watered down MK fighting game. No real brutality, no real blood and even the fatalities are just not very impressive. For instance, Baraka jumps on top of people and impales them but no close up, no pool of blood and no visible post puncture wounds. Sub-Zero body slams people after turning them into a block of ice and they explode but you only see ice chunks, instead of meat, organs and blood like one would expect. Now I understand that the addition of DC characters is going to demand accessability to a certain younger market than MK is used to and had this been a dominantly DC game, it would've worked. This game however, had all the calling cards of an MK game, minus of course those elements that make it a true MK game. Also, where are the acid pool, the human devouring trees, the spiked ceiling and all the other death traps? In the end, the lack of the mature rating did really hurt this game's ability to be truly awesome.

Now. there are some good points, or I wouldn't have given it 3 stars. The graphics and animation are truly stellar, exactly what I've been waiting to see in a next gen MK game. My only beef there is, the MK characters look a helluva lot better then the DC ones. Also, they stripped down the fighting itself and took out the annoying aspects like multiple fighting stances and 15 button combos (ok, maybe I'm exaggerating) that are virtually impossible to pull off. There are still combos but you can easily get by knowing a couple or a few and the special moves. The Klose Kombat feature is really cool but the test your might, freefall and rage modes are just not that good.

It's safe to say that this isn't what I was hoping for. Maybe there's another ""pure"" MK game in store in the not too distant future.",Could have been so much better,1227916800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Arguably, to create a smash game that was brought up from the Nintendo 64 era is quite amazing. That has happened with the successful Mario Party franchise from the N64 era. It was one of the surprising games ever developed back in the 90's. To do it again for the Gamecube was quite a surprise. While so many additions have been added, the Gamecube debut was very well put. It just added on so much from before, nothing but the roll of the dice was missed.

Mario Party 4 for the Nintendo Gamecube, the Gamecube debut consists of so many outrageous boards, and games to uncover. The game also adds some new details including a tougher story mode, and a whole bunch of new features, new boards like Bowser's Party, new mini, and mega mushrooms, and 50 great mini-games to unlock, such as Mario Speedwagon. The graphics look much better than they did for the N64, and the gameplay has improved nicely. Yet, with all the hype, there are a few disadvantages the game has. One of them is the games take a little longer to load up, unlike the N64 versions which were a instant. Another disadvantage is that it might not seem as challenging for Gamecube players, as much as Mario Party veterans have matched before.

Still, Mario Party 4 makes a great virtual board game feel for anybody who wants to roll those dice on the Gamecube. While you can right now only find this game used, it is still a great purchase for anybody wants to play. It doesn't add up solo, but if you're playing with others, it is a real party to match.

4.0,False,"08 22, 2005",AEOAMS0G96E8B,B0009PQCSU,Paul Arellano,"Playing Dungeon Siege 2 is like playing Dungeon Siege 1. There's absolutely no difference in playing style, a few improved graphics, a new skill tree, lots of things to kill, a ""save at town"" save feature, and a mysterious bug where items you had in your pack seem to disappear when you respawn after getting slaughtered.

Technical Part:

The game comes in a whopping 4 CDs (or 5?). Comes in a nice plastic case, and a manual. Installation is straightforward. Install, replace CD, click OK, then wait, then put next CD. The game runs pretty well on a medium build PC (e.g 2.5g P4 with a 128 mb card). You can always adjust the resolution and texture quality of the game. No crash to desktops. All in all, pretty stable installation and game playing

Bug:

Ok...now the bug. For some reason you lose items when you respawn after getting slaughtered. Now...it only happened to me once. After hearing other players about it, I realized it is an existing bug. So...my advice. Keep all your important stuff in the storage.

Gameplay:

There's no point in really trying to focus on who to target specifically when the fighting starts. You can get mobs thirty deep so all you can really do is squint and view the monsters, the special lighting effects, and a mass of confusing graphic paperdolls hacking away at each other. Getting mobbed by thirty baddies is almost downright impossible to see your team from the rest of the unforgiving hordes of baddies. There's a lazy fix to this. Go to Options and select: Auto Attack and Auto Defend. This puts your Dungeon Siege 2 act like it's Dungeon Siege 1. Remember the first Dungeon Siege where the game auto kills anything without mashing your mouse button? Well, you can do that here too through the Options menu.  Select both options, sit back and relax...throw a few heal potions using hotkeys and you have one automated hack slash festival.

So....is the game any better than other hack and slash games? Umm...nope. In fact, DS2 borrowed so many concepts and structures from Diablo 2...from storage chest, teleporters,save a town only feature, skill tree, and separating the whole game into chapters. You can say DS2 is the 2005 version of Diablo 2. Structure and framework almost similar to Diablo 2.

How's the fun factor? Well...let me put it this way. If you don't want to think too much and you basically just want to get your mind involved to do stuff (besides sleeping and staring at the TV), DS2 does the job well. It's one of those games where you just want to play it and not lose your mind over a brain-damaging puzzle. It's a pure hack-slash mindless romp across exotic locales. Sometimes it's good not to use your brain and just want to relax. Well...DS2 does. It's a good game. Good graphics...simple and easy to beat. My advice: BUY IT.",Same hack-slash routine..a bug..decent game,1124668800,119,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

It was built around a new SyFi series set in a massive online open world

Gamers need to stop listening to so many jerk-off so called gaming channels
TheAngryJoes, Boogie, etc.  don't pay for games or even hardware for that matter (Payola) is massive in the gaming press and youtube stars really can't be trusted
The game itself has been free to Play for a bit now (You just need a Premium account)
and a good size amount of space on your HD

Story: Is actually enjoyable if you watched the series it makes more sense (everything ties into the first two seasons)
And it's not overly complicated and lazy

The V/O and Graphics are pretty good

The Gameplay it's like GTA/Saints Row meets Star Wars it's a fun 3rd person open world shooter, etc.
Just because you are on a online server doesn't mean you have to play with others the game itself is played out through a single player story line you'll encounter others online and you can team up against a big enemy then go your own way

The Controls: are solid it's a little stiff like GTA type of games  (It's less of a Arcade style 3rd person game like Saints Row) Once you get the hang of it the controls are fine

The Fun/Experience  This game is and was Destiny before Destiny but, it's a solid dumbed-down mmo
the grinding is there but, I honestly doubt anyone put 200 hrs into Defiance
There are stories of people putting 300+ hrs into Destiny (That is insane)
Plus now it's free

I personally think this was a great game.  It is challenging from the beginning and continually becomes more challenging.  I judge a game by how many times I curse at it.  I cursed a lot trying to master the moves and you must account for the fact that your team mate is not as good as the AI for the other team.  Your team mate will constantly make you mad until you realize you don't have to set her you can hit all the time on the second shot.  The game flows well and I haven't tried to use any cheats because that would ruin all of the fun.  The mini games are a nice touch to get your skills up and trying to get new characters keeps you wanting to play on.  I think this is a great game and I may be partial because I loved Outlaw Golf as well.  I think it is a great game that focuses alot more on volleyball than DOA did.  In fact after learning the basics of DOA you could just look at the actual gameplay as a needless show to get more items.  In conclusion this is a great game and despite the fact that Live doesnt really work all that well the game stands alone great.

4.0,True,"12 4, 2011",ADQFN4681WQL,B000FQBPCQ,CP,"This Zelda game started off real slow.  The first half of the game, I was extremely disappointed.  It felt very linear- everything was cut off until you completed some task to open up another small area, rinse and repeat.  There was no connection with the characters.  Everything felt forced.  And everything felt handed to you.  Epona... here you go.  In Ocarina, you actually had to work to get her, and when you did it was awesome.  Here, everything is obtained so easily, including the Master Sword.  There's no buildup.  In A Link to the Past, you see the Master Sword all shining in the grove and you're like, man I've gots to get me that.  But you had to work for it.  In this game, it's like Master Sword? What's that?  Oh this thing that I just happened to get as I was following this extemely linear storyline?  Let me just put it this way.  In previous games, you would see a locked door.  So guess what?  You have to go find the key.  In this game, 95% of the time, you'll have managed to obtain the key before you even know there's a locked door.  Why even make the door locked in the first place?  And don't get me started on the boring fetch quest of finding the Twilight Tear bugs.  Jeebus.
The first half of the game also felt too easy.  I never really felt any threat of dying.  Well, I didn't do so good on the bridge joust at first (cough cough)fell off a few times, but aside from that, enemies were handled too easily by a simple wagging of the wii controller.  Bosses looked epic and amazing, but when it takes them a million hits to knock you down 3 hearts, well, there's no impending threat and you can calmly figure out how to beat them.  Not that it was hard to figure out.
Well, ok... that being said, the second half of the game got much better.  You can finally explore a bit.  Castle town opens up where you can finally mingle with the townsfolk.  You can play some sidegames, go on some side quests.  Now this is Zelda as I know it.  Freedom to explore.
The game difficulty got better as well.  Some enemies actually required some attack timing and finesse.  And thank you for the Cave of Ordeals- a combat challenge at last- something I felt was sorely lacking in Ocarina and Majora's Mask (haven't played Wind Waker yet).  But I still wished that enemy attacks took off more of your health.  It just doesn't feel threatening when some badazz looking enemy smacks you, and you lose only 1/2 a heart.  I remember the good ol days of the original Zelda when some baddies took off like 4 hearts.  Now that's what'll make you sweat.  In a good way.  Cause that's what really motivates you to find heart containers, find bottles, and buy potions.  I rarely bought any potions in this game.  My bottles usually carried lantern oil.  Now that's a travesty.
I did however really enjoy the 2nd half of this game.  I actually quit playing during the first half- put it away for months- but then decided I had to force myself to finish it.  But thankfully, I found myself liking it more and more.
I would have initially given this 2-3 stars, but it redeemed itself in the end to get 4.
Graphics were awesome.  Doesn't feel outdated at all, even playing it in 2011.  In my opinion, grpahics don't need to get any better than this.  It's all about the gameplay from here.
Controls were ok.  I hated the fact that when Link has his sword sheathed, you have to waggle to get the sword out, and then waggle again to swing.  So if you switch to using your secondary item, like a bow or hookshot, Link automatically sheathes his sword.  I don't know how many times I rolled when I meant to do a jump strike.  And the nunchuck analog felt a bit wanky.  Sometimes I had a hard time positioning Link right to just open a treasure chest or grab that fallen rupy instead of circling around it.
The item menu sucked.  Why have everything in a big circle with things moving around all the time once you get a new item.  I like knowing where my stuff is in a visually friendly format that's easy to navigate.
Ok, I feel like I just keep going back to the negative stuff so I'm going to end my review here.  Good thing, too, because I have alot more complaints believe me.

As with the original FlatOut this is another high quality racing game that pits you against 7 other, hell-bent on winning, computer drivers. The game is also playable on the Internet against real opponents.

 The Pros:

1.)The races are over a variety of terrain; there are  race tracks, country roads, desert wastelands and towns.

3.)The physics, as with the original game, are hard to believe! Sliding around corners, braking, crashes are very realistic.

4.)Initially you only get to a limited number of tracks (and cars) to chose from until you finish at least in the top 3 places in a race, at which point new areas to race are opened up for you to try. You can use your winnings to upgrade your existing car or even buy a better vehicle if you have the funds. This is a great feature as it gives you incentive to finish high in the standings.

5.)There are an assortment of bonus games and stunts that become available as you proceed through this game. These are fun but not the adrenalin pumping action of the real game.

6.)The rag doll effect (driver flying through the windshield after an accident) is stopped immediately (thankfully) once the reset button is pressed.

The Cons:

1.)Although there are lots of racing venues, there seemed to be a lot of repetition of the race tracks that are used; every new racing area opened up, seemed to use the same tracks  (with some slight variations) you'd finish is the last competition.

2.)There as no info booklet or game sheet with the game (just the 5 discs); the manual is on the disc itself. Anyone playing FlatOut for the first time would be hard pressed to figure out the controls and especially to play in the first person perspective (and really the only way to play this race is from the drivers seat looking out the windshield) instead of 3rd person (from above and behind the car) which is the default.

3.)Finally, my most serious complaint with this addition to the Flatout series is the lack of car damage (that effects drivability). With the original Flatout there was a ""Pro"" mode that allowed car damage to really affect performance; this is not the case with Flatout 2. If I had to name one major distraction from this game it would have to be that the major emphasis is on destroying objects and wrecking other drivers,(which were prominent in the original but not to the same degree) instead of skillful driving. And it's a shame really, because the AI of the computer drivers in really good and when combined with tract difficulty, makes winning a race against them a real challenge. I just think they went the wrong direction in this game and as a result I didn't enjoy this game quiet as much as the  original.

Suggestions:

1.) To be competitive you really need a steering wheel with a gas/brake pedal feature.

2.) Power and speed are important but so are handling and braking; so spend money on stabilizers, tires and shocks as well as the ""power items"".

3.) Take some time at the beginning to set up the game to make it work right; go to the ""Options"" menu, set it to your likings (especially the ""camera"" setting which will allow you to set up a key on the keyboard so you can toggle through the different views to get the first person perspective) and you'll be rewarded with great driving competition.

All in all, as good a racing Sim as I could ask for (with some minor reservations mentioned above). If you liked the original game, I'm sure you enjoy this one as well. 4-4  Stars.","Almost,  but  not quite , as good as the original FlatOut",1157155200,5,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

4.0,False,"08 10, 2009",A24O6U575872K1,B001COVME6,B. Mills,"I have been looking forward to this game since this time last year.  Now that I have it in my hands I find that despite my anticipation for this game I was still surprised with this game.  It wasn't at all what I expected which for me its rare to be surprised by how the game plays (its usually just a matter of how well).  The simple reason is: you just can't sum up this game in a review/preview so I won't try.  What I will say is that despite being pleasantly surprised by this game I found myself increasingly aware of just how close it came to all-time greatness... but missed.

There are some weird/bad choices which hurt the pure joy of this game which I was made painfully aware of thanks to an TERRIBLE save/load system.  BEWARE!  IT is very easy to erase/save over your game... my GF saved over my first game because even when you start a new game it takes you strait to the last created save and you can easily delete saves by simply pressing Z twice while in the load screen (which I also did).  So,  by having to restart the game twice do to a terribly designed save system (I just don't understand how these things make it past testing) I had the ability to fully realize the reach of the game and where it falls short.

This game has so much more depth than you might realize and building up your kingdom is so fun that it becomes very disappointing that you can't do certain things.  I wish your people did more on their own or anything at all.  I wish you could assign people daily tasks, which wouldn't be necessary for all players but just a good way to get through the game more quickly if you are a skilled player.  Which reminds me, in some ways this games punishes you for being a thorough.  For instance when you make citizens get a job class there is a random element to how much life they receive, but since that is the only random element I find it unacceptable to settle for anything other than full possible health which i spend hours obtaining by reloading saves (until my save gets erased.  They should have just had everyone come out with the same health or at least have different things like attack strength which balanced this out.

A great game should be playable by players of any skill level with good gamers capable of achieving more such as a record of no deaths, however this game simply makes it frustrating by adding no skill elements to the equation such as the life thing mentioned above which has the result of simply being easier to not care if your people die (which it doesn't really matter).  However don't think this is game is easy either... its not!  I have to beat every boss for my GF because the actiony part of the game is not for her at all which reminds me: its too bad there is no pointer functionality in the wii-mote it could really go a LONG way in this game.  Also considering the way my GF lieks to play the game it reminds me of something else they could/have should have done:  make the treasure finding more extensive without requiring battle.

All that said its still a very good game and for anyone who likes Pikmin or Overlord you will like this game a lot.  The story is great... the cut scenes are fantastic and despite being unbelievably adorable its not just a kids game.

You're probably like my wife and I who used the Wii Fit religiously for about a month and then slowly became too lazy to take out the board and weigh ourselves each day. It got to the point where unless friends or family were over and we wanted to show off our ski jumping skills we barely ever used Wii Fit. Fortunately we ended up buying this game and for less than $20 we ended up using the Wii Fit board regularly again trying to master the new games. There are about 15 new aerobic/balance games and probably half of them are fun enough to play over and over. The other half are interesting at first and then you never go back to them again. There are also new Yoga and Strength positions, but we never really used those in the first place so I can't really comment on them.

This game is definitely an inexpensive way to add some life to your Wii Fit experience and if you're getting someone a new Wii Fit (earlier version that doesn't include Plus) for Christmas this game is definitely worth including as a stocking stuffer.",Nice addition to the Wii Fit - several new fun aerobic/balance games,1291248000,,,

Beneath that, you get essentially a game that's taken its cue from Gears of War.  Now is that necessarily a bad thing?  I don't think so, considering the mammoth success of the GoW series.  However, the introduction of FUSE weapons are what makes the game wonderful.  The strategy behind utilizing the strengths of each weapon (which is assigned to a specific character) adds for some intense and rewarding gameplay.  Also, the AI is really tough and that's a good thing.  The enemy forces you to think, act, and react to stay alive.  However, when things go south, you can always revive your teammates.  Now, I did wish the game was a little more ""tight"" as the shooting can feel a bit sluggish/floaty.

This case pairs well with the Hori hard pouch, as I can confirm that the console with the case on fits rather snugly in the hard pouch.

The #1 downside of this case, along with all 3DS shell cases, is that you cannot dock the 3DS to the docking bay/charging station while the case is on.  You can, however, still charge your 3DS, with the case on, by plugging the charger into your 3DS rather than into your docking bay.  Still, it sucks because the docking bay holds the 3DS at a convenient angle for watching Netflix.

This case is basic and functional.  The hard plastic mold has cutouts for all the controls and card slots, giving you complete access to everything while protecting most of the 3DS body from scratches.

It also has cutouts for the cameras.  I would have preferred that the cameras be protected from scratches, assuming the clear shell did not interfere with the camera's functionality.  I'm no optics expert so I don't know if that would have been feasible.

As for the aesthetics, I prefer clear shells because they preserve the underlying body color of the game system.  The downside is that dust *will* visibly get caught between the shell and the console, whereas with an opaque shell you would only have to worry about wiping off the dust on the surface of the shell.

It is a great edition to a series that is often overturned or under rated.

Evil Dead Regeneration doesn't in fact continue the game series (as in, it doesn't follow A Fist Full of Boomstick) but moreover from the actual movie itself; Evil Dead. As from the beginning of ED:R you begin in the Prof. Knowby's cabin and go to present day, where Ash (voiced by Bruce Campbell, the hero of the Evil Dead series) is in an insane asylum after being arrested for the murder of his friends and claiming the dead themselves came to life and killed them.

One of the best features of the game is the addition of Evil Dead's first Sidekick, a ADD driven  half-deadite midget named Sam (voiced by Ted Riami, the guy who played Joxer in Xena) made that way by Reinhart, the doctor of the asylum who has come into procession of the Book of the Dead and Knowby's Diary. Sam is also in the same insane asylum with Ash.

Ash and Sam are forced to team up, and have a chalk and cheese relationship. Sam is a talker, he continues to talk his mouth off and Ash continues to tell him to shut up alot. They make a wonderful combination for this game.

Sam can also be useful in battle, pressing the Up Directional Button, Ash can kick Sam onto Deadites to attack them, kick him into a furnace, a meat mincer or even a basketball hoop just for fun and giggles. Ash can also `possess' Sam and you can control him in situations to dangerous for Ash (as he is mortal, Sam is immortal).

One of the disappointing aspects of the game is that you can only have 6 weapons, a chainsaw, grappling hook and/or flamethrower on his right arm, and either a pistol, shotgun or boom lance on his left arm. The chainsaw does get upgraded though, too a titanium belted.

Another disappointment is the repeat play with Peepers, even though he's cute.

Some of the interviews include answers to rumors about Evil Dead 4 and Freddy vs. Jason vs Ash and also something confusing about Spiderman vs. Ash which was a laugh.

It's amazing how the Sims have changed since that first version. Having said that I've never mastered all it's subtle nuances of either the Sims original (and it's expansions) or the Sims 2 with it's myriad add ons; expansion packs kept coming more quickly than I could master everything they have to offer.  I've awaited this release with much anticipation; I've watched the developer's videos and the advertisements.  It was said in one of EAs videos that the creators wanted to make the Sims easier to play; that people they surveyed wanted a less complex game.  After playing for only 1 evening, I can honestly say that I feel they have met their objective.  Gone are the spinning hopes and fears with rapid mood crashes, popularity meters and so forth.  The result to me is that the Sims seem more like real people and me not having to keep track of so many things will enhance my gaming experience. Also gone are the often confusing Sims astrological signs with their associated personality traits that often determined the fate of relationships.

With this version of the Sims they seemed to go with a more realistic, less cartoonish appearance for the characters.  The effects and water is beautiful.  I was a bit dissapointed with the selection of male hair styles and facial hair selection; but I'm not overly concerned about this.  The nature of the Sims universe is for it to expand; it won't be long before we're being offered ""stuff"" packs and expansion packs.  After having so much stuff for the Sims 2, this game often feels stripped down--but I have to remind myself of the hundreds of dollars I spent for Sims add ons to realize EA isn't stupid--people will add on with crazy abandon.  If you're not prepared for the onslaught of Sims add ons perhaps you'll want to skip this game; it can quickly run up a charge card.

I like the seamless neighborhood where you can walk anywhere--but I miss the option of calling a Taxi (or at least I've not found a way to call one yet).  Yes I agree with another reviewer that I'm glad that the long transitions between locations is now gone.  That, I feel, is the most compelling reason to upgrade--the rest of the game seems not very unlike the preceding versions.

I think the little 2 Gig flash drive with extra content included which comes with the collectors edition is cool. To me it was worth the extra $20 for the collector's edition--a flash drive of that size alone would cost that much; there's also a $10.00 gift certificate for the Sims content site and a car to download for free.

In the final analysis if you love the Sims, you'll eventually love the Sims 3 once you master the differences between whatever version you were playing and the current one.  I love the way they have simplified things somewhat; at times I have felt that the creators had gotten a little carried away with all their meters.

July 13, 2008--A Second Look

Having played the Sims 3 for over a month now I can honestly say that it has grown on me.  Oh, and in regards to the Taxi's, well they will just come without calling for them specifically--but you can walk or jog anywhere in the town.  In some ways things are more automatic; but not in others (the Sims can still forget to eat or go potty sometimes).  You also no longer just send people to work; you have a drop down directing their actions at work which affects their promotions and moods when they get home.

If you have a house with more than 2 Sims in it is sometimes difficult to keep track of them all the time--especially if some are downtown and others are at home.  The game transitions rapidly between locations when switching characters; but it's easy to miss something important since everything is in real time happening simultaneously.  Unlike the Sims 2 where when someone left the lot time froze--now time waits for no one.  In the future I'd like to see a split screen option or PIP that you can have 2 locations open in at the same time so that one does not have to jump back and forth.

All in all am liking the Sims 3 better than the preceding versions.  It comes with a number of options that were only available in expansion packs in the past.

The overall idea of the game is a good one. No intro scene showing you how Hayden mutated into the hero he is, instead you play out the transformation. Level one being your training ground and introduction to the system, the black and white look was a great idea from the designers. Level two sees the start of the transformation and the game switches to color.

When you get to use the Glaive for the first time, it feels a little weak but soon you will earn new skills in using the weapon. Later on, you will get the ability to control the Glaive in flight and this is when it becomes valuable.

Controlling the Glaive using the motion sensor was cumbersome so I switched that off and used the right stick. I found I was more accurate using this method.

Graphically, the game is awesome and a welcome addition to my game collection. My only complaint (and the reason for only four stars) is the annoying camera angle. When a number of enemies attack you from multiple directions, it can be hard to move the camera around to get a good shot. I had to redo some sections due to a soldier shooting me from behind and struggling to get the camera to swing around so I could take a shot.  Camera angles can be an issue for some third person games but this one was particularly frustrating.

That aside, Dark Sector is a wonderful game to look at and fun to play. Trust me, when you start throwing the Glaive around and controlling its flight, you can't help but smile at the slow motion carnage.",As Good As Expected,1206921600,28,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

U, and Super Luigi U) are on one disc. The games are great if your an 80's kid that still enjoys Mario, like me. Happy to have those games over the Wii U Sports games! Setting up the system isn't too hard. There are some pieces that come with it, which are stands for the system & controller/gamepad. The gamepad comes with it's own charger. You'll want to either charge your gamepad/controller before you start the system set up. Or keep it on the charger while starting to system set up (that's what I did). When you set up the system, you'll need to be able to go online. You go through all the user info, ect..and it will ask you for a net connection. Once you do that, you'll start to update your Wii U system to play the games (to my understanding this is the same with the Xbox One & PS4 too). Once you start the update DO NOT POWER OFF OR UNPLUG ANYTHING. This may cause your ""brick"" (freeze up and not work). And when the system is updating, it may seem like it is done quickly but it is not done. You can see the update progress/status if you look for it. It is a little bit of a process....but just follow the steps and you'll get through it before too long.  Then enjoy your Wii U!!! I am NOT a ""fanboy"" of one system. So I like & buy all consoles/systems for gaming. But I gotta be honest....I was a little dissapointed with the first Wii. Nintendo had catered to the ""casual gamer"" too much in my opinion. Making gimmicky, and really cartoony-simplistic games. I'm all for Mario,Zelda,Metroid,ect...But would have really liked some games for the hardcore gamers too! Afterall, we're the one's that have been supporting their business since the 1980's!! They should have considered making games like PS3 & Xbox 360. I know the first Wii wasn't as powerfull as those systems. But the Wii U is supposedly a little bit more powerfull. And they claimed the Wii U can have better graphics than 360 & PS3. So with that said, I am expecting more hardcore gamer games with this system!!! Zombi U got mediocre reviews. But I have a feeling that games is good. So I am going to get that in a week or two! It has good graphics, and from some of what I heard, gameplay too! Also I'll test that better graphics ststement with Call Of Duty Ghost. And some other more recent releases. I don't like that Nintendo Wii U's game library consisted of many games already released years ago by PS3 & 360. Many people already played/own those games. So why would they be interested in buying the same games on a ""next gen"" system!?! I'm not....I want new games!!! And the Wii U has some to offer so far. But really need to step it up, entering it's second year! Wii U has the potential to be a great system. That's if they focus more on great games over ""casual"" games. A few game developers have said that they won't even work on Wii U games. Which sucks, cause some of those companies are good companies. However....Many still are. And Capcom is one of them!

~~~ Evil Under The Sun ~~~
In this game, Captain Hastings switches bodies with Poirot to try and catch a killer. As a point and click game, you can collect objects, use items, combine items, and investigate items.
- Pros: You can always go back to London and get help from Poirot. The puzzles are interesting and there is definitely adventure to be had!
- Cons: Poirot will not run so you end up watching him walk slowly from place to place.

~~~ Murder on The Orient Express ~~~
As Antoinette you assist Mr. Poirot in finding the killer of a very unpopular Mr. Ratchett. Game play is similar to the Evil Under the Sun game but you will also have to collect fingerprints and shoe sizes.
- Pros: This game has the best story line out of all the games. The puzzles are mostly intuitive and there are some very nice twists! You can also go head to head with Poirot and score points. Antoinette doesn't dawdle so you don't sit for long periods of time just waiting for her to move to the next place.
- Cons: You have to collect all the fingerprints and you have to collect a shoe imprint. You then have to compare the prints to each passenger, which is a painstaking process. Also, you should inspect each and every item you pick up because sometimes, you cannot move forward until you have inspected that item.

~~~ And Then There Were None ~~~
You are stranded on an island with ten other people. One by one, they start dropping like flies. You have to work against the clock to figure out who the murderer is before none are left!
- Pros: The game has a very good story line with three possible endings, depending on the decisions you make. Puzzles are not too challenging while still being fun. You can run! I love to make characters run outside.
- Cons: People talk a lot and sometimes information becomes repetitive. You can collect fingerprints but it's useless, because you don't really do anything with them.

Performance is at the top of its class, and the customization options rival the best models out there.

PROS:
++ High performance Cherry MX RGB mechanical key switches for awesome responsiveness & feedback
++ Super smooth key action makes typing a pleasure
++ Keyboard is plug and play, working before you install the software
++ RGB backlighting allows almost unlimited color backlighting customization options
++ Brushed aluminum body and braided cable are super solid and durable
++ Updated desktop control software (Corsair Utility Engine, aka Cue)
++ Convenient star lighting button lets you adjust brightness or disable LED lighting
++ BIOS switch on the back can help if you have compatibility issues
++ Onboard memory for portable settings
++ Multicolor backlighting per-key (via software)
++ Can assign a macro to any key (via software)
++ Included wrist-rest is high quality & well integrated, but can be detached for another setup
++ Media keys and volume slider are discrete yet functional
++ 100% anti-ghosting with 104 key rollover on USB
++ Integrated number pad
++ Elevated / removable keys make cleaning the keyboard super easy
++ High quality and comprehensive downloadable quick start guide and product manual
++ Despite reports, I have had zero technical problems so far despite extended use
++ Four rubber feet on the bottom for stability and four keyboard height adjustment legs for different angles / elevations

CONS:
-- Comes at a very steep premium, making the stock K70 a better value if you can do without the RGB
-- No built-in macro keys (though Cue lets you assign macros to any key)
-- No included keyboard cover or travel case (not required items but nice to have)
-- Software has some flaws, but is still good enough to get the job done IMHO
-- Alternatives like the G710 provide many more dedicated customizable keys
-- More space between the function keys the top row would have been better
-- High reports of LED failures and warrantee issues are a cause for concern
-- Super sensitive keys create a risk of mis-clicks
-- Hard wired cord requires two USB ports
-- No USB pass-through ports

HARDWARE:

The heart of any mechanical keyboard is the key switch under each key.  Thats what gives you the smooth reliable action and feedback when you press the key.  I have more keyboards than the average data center, and I actually use them heavily.  This unit uses the most superior key switch I have encountered in a mechanical keyboard in terms of responsiveness and feedback.

The keyboard body is made of anodized brushed aluminum, making it light, durable and attractive.  I had to move this to a crowded work area and accidentally dropped it but was happy that the keyboard seemed to hold up like a champ.

A removable wrist-rest is included.  It has a plastic body and a dimpled silicon surface.  This is not an ergonomically shaped keyboard but the wrist-rest really helped me when typing.

The keys are made out of high quality plastic.  They are slightly curved and laser etched, so I plan to put a lot of mileage on them without worrying about fading letters.  They feel great to type on; while marketed towards gamers, many writers would love to have a keyboard like this.

There are also some other nice extras, such as the volume roller and media keys in the upper right hand corner.

SOFTWARE:

In order to customize your keyboard macros and LED color scheme, you need download and install the Corsair Utility Engine (aka Cue) from Corsairs website.  As of the time of this review update (October 2015) the application takes up a hefty 162MB.

Installation is fast and simple (still x86) and start to finish took about 20 minutes.  The website also includes a quick start guide and a product manual to help you through the nuances of configuring your keyboard.

Upon initial startup the software (which is updated and maintained) didn't recognize my keyboard until I performed a firmware update.  It prompted me to do the update and didn't require a reboot.

LIGHTING:

The default setup has a universal red LED scheme with white boxes on the WASD and direction buttons.  You have both standard and advanced customization options, and can download and import custom profiles or create your own.  You can also make your own custom key color assignments.  Consult the manual.

There are several built in lighting effects:
- Spiral Rainbow
- Rainbow Wave
- Visor
- Rain
- Color Shift
- Color Pulse
- Color Wave
- Key Type Lighting
- Ripple Type Lighting

CONCLUSION

This keyboard is a solid performer, and one of the most responsive mechanical keyboards you can buy.  When compared to other products, it lacks the quantity of dedicated macro keys people would normally want in a gaming keyboard.  But they try to make up for that with the customizable software that lets you assign a macro to any key.  And the very attractive and functional RGB backlighting puts this over the top.

It has a solid one-player mode, but it shines in Multi-player.  At this point of writing, the Online wi-fi service has been having some issues, but Nintendo has acknowledged them and is working to resolve them.  My theory is that the game sold so well and so many people were trying to use the online service all at once it struggled with the load.  My reasoning for this is that the service works much better late, late at night or earlier in the day.  In the evenings it's almost impossible to get a game set up.... right now.  I have faith Nintendo will get that resolved.

Graphically, the game is great.  The best the DS has to offer, and it would stand up against any Playstation One or N64 title any day.  Artistically, the game is very similar to the Gamecube Metroid games, which is a good thing.  The developers even gave special thanks to Retro Studios for their hard work on building the franchise up.

Soundwise, the game is also top notch.  No game yet, except maybe Electroplankton, is better.

Control-  Ok, here's my real complaint.  My hands hurt.  I'm cramped up because the DS is shaped weird and it's kind of heavy.  I recommend using the little thumb strap thing that came with your DS.  It takes getting used to, but it's truly the superior control method.  My biggest, biggest, BIGGEST complaint is that one of the shoulder buttons is barely used, and instead of mapping a jump action to the button, jumping is performed by double-tapping the screen.  It works, but I have a real feather touch on the screen and I accidentally end up jumping a lot when I don't mean to.  On the plus side, in multi-player my accidental jumps really make it tough for opponents to get a bead on me!  Small blessing I suppose.

Online play is good and you can select rivals and friends or choose to play against strangers.  One feature I am really liking is the ability to set people as ""rivals"" after a game.  If the other person agrees to be your rival, you can later seek them out online and set games up against them.  It's a great feature as you can start to get to know some of your opponents and their styles.

Graphics- The graphics are beautiful but not as polished as in the ps2.  The terrain looks kinda pixelated.  I kinda feel like they could have done a better job in the graphics department.  They did away with the FMV's and went with the anime drawing w/ some narration.

The flying segments of the game work pretty much exactly like the planes in CS: HRTR which is a good thing. It is easy to control after a few minutes geting accustom to what buttons do what. (I used an xbox 360 controller while playing. I'm not sure how tough it would be with a mouse and keyboard). The shooting aspect of the game is alot like gears of war, you can take cover, hop over cover and jump from cover all with the press of a button. You can also jump up vertically and down off ledges just as easy. It is done very well and I never struggled with the controls. The graphics in Dark Void are good and use the Unreal engine but there are many times where the game is trying to stream information for the level or save a checkpoint which can lead to some horrible slowdown. Its not gamebreaking but I would have rather the developer use a cutscene or something to mask this because it is really noticeable. The art design is done well and you with see areas that are similar to areas in games like uncharted or tomb raider while others have a futuristic look. The character and enemy design is also done well and all though its nothing amazing, overall they look good. The enemies are a bit repetitive but the devs mix up the things you do well enough to overcome this. Dark Voids main problem is that it seems like the developer ran out of time or money to finish the game. I think it needed at least another chapter with 3-4 more areas to tell the story and add a build up to the end of the game. Even the end of the game comes to an abrupt halt just when you think its going to get really good. I think they figured they would fininsh the story in part 2 unfourtunatly I don't think Capcom is going to make another game. Its a shame because Dark Void is a good game that could have been a great series. I enjoyed Dark Void but have to knock a few points of for the framerate issues and the unfinished story.

4.0,False,"04 29, 2012",A3E7YWI8VV7VCV,B003O6EAM6,Hrafnkell Haraldsson,"Disclaimer: I am writing this review as a former player of Head Coach '09 and a fan of franchise football over control of individual players. It is absolutely essential that you read Josh Looman's post on EA.com about this game's franchise mode: [...]. You won't find any of this explained in the game or in the Prima player's guide. Even this post is incomplete in so far as it doesn't explain how to use some of the new features (like scouting).

General Observations:
Madden 12 is an improvement over Madden 10's franchise mode. I haven't played Madden 11. Most of the features that made Head Coach so enjoyable are here, plus a few others that Head Coach lacked. But it is still clear that franchise mode, despite Josh Looman's involvement, still plays second fiddle in the Madden franchise. Looman did Head Coach '09 and did a very good job. He also does a very good job here but as he says in the above-linked post, in Head Coach '09 his team ""created the most in-depth career mode game ever.""

Commentary:
I agree with other reviewers. The commentary is Madden 12 is terrible. You might as well turn it off and put on some music. You hear completely ridiculous things unrelated to the play on the field. For example, I am winning a game as the Panthers 40-10 with under a minute to go, the ball in my possession inside the opponent's red zone. Cam Newton kneels to run out the clock. The commentary which follows is that my quarterback feels the need to take the ball himself and looks rattled.  Another incredibly stupid remark: that Cam Newton and Sanzenbacher have been playing together for years - both are rookies.
The words sound disjointed - it's a terrible job and EA should be ashamed of themselves.

What adds insult to injury is that you will hear the entire repertoire each game. Be prepared to hear Chris Collinsworth tell you several times a game how he would not want to face a defensive lineman because they're ""big and nasty"" or how much he hates return specialists who dance around and try to be playmakers.

And listening to your coordinators, which was interesting at times in Head Coach, is not a realistic option here. I don't know where they found the voice talent but they shouldn't have bothered. Sure, the guy explains the play but with a voice that has made millions of high school students fall asleep in their chairs.

Starting a Franchise:
This is a bit of a disappointment. Rather than opening with a screen showing your franchise you are presented with the first pre-season game. To get to another menu so that you can see what you have, you have to hit ""Y"" and choose from the options there. Worse yet, if you back out of your menu (""B"") you don't actually return to the main menu but go back to the screen inviting you to start your next game, forcing you to press ""Y"" to start all over again. I'd rather have a better organized menu - the clipboard in Head Coach '09 was one of that game's best features.

Playing Games as a Head Coach:
Fortunately, you can do this. My preferred method is to let my coordinators call my plays as in the NFL. My goal is to put together a team and then watch them play. I may reserve important decisions to myself, as a real head coach does, such as when to go for it on fourth down, when to call a time out in a crucial situation, etc, but I'd as soon watch the play than micromanage the players on the field.

It is essential that you at the start of each game go to Settings -> Game Options ->  Coach Mode and set Coach Mode to ""On."" This will cause your QB to throw the ball if you do nothing after snapping the ball. Otherwise, he will stand there and get sacked. The change must be made at the start of each game, unfortunately.

AI/Difficulty Level:
You must set difficulty to at least ""All Pro"" if you hope to have competitive games. This will set both Player and CPU skill at 50. Pro gives your team too much of an advantage - DeAngelo Williams pounded out 348 yards (an NFL record) on just 31 carries at Pro level and my backup HB ran for over 400 yards at the Easy level in a pre-season game. In Head Coach, 50/50 made things competitive for the most part. Yu have to watch for your coordinator wanting to kick field goals at well outside your kicker's range. It won't even show you an option for punt so you have to look at the complete list of plays to find special teams and then punt. I have found myself a couple of times trying for impossible because I wasn't paying enough attention.

How  it's better than Head Coach '09:
* Graphics. This is the most obvious improvement since Head Coach '09 wasn't even up to snuff relative to Madden '09.
* Current players including 2012 draft. With Head Coach '09 you are stuck with the '08 draft class and then fantasy draft classes after that. You can only play so many careers with the same players.
* If they screw up ratings (as they often do) you can edit them.
* Draft classes in Madden 12 have randomized names so when you play a new career you won't know which players to automatically latch onto.
* You can squib kick in Madden 12. I could never understand how they failed to include this option in Head Coach '09. There are times a squib kick is essential (when you want to run out the clock to keep Tom Brady off the field at the end of the game with a narrow lead).
* You can also angle your punts toward the sidelines. In Head Coach `09, punters almost never do this and when they do they do it at the worst possible moment, when you are deep in your own territory and they kick it out of bounds for a 17 yard punt. I generally dislike having to do my own kicking but it's worth it for these improvements alone.
*  I have also yet to see a QB suddenly throw the ball at the ceiling, which I have seen happen in Head Coach '09.
How it's Worse than Head Coach:
* The RPG element of being the head coach is missing since you are not creating a head coach to represent you as your ""character""; they say the coach's ability affects the team in small ways but it's not the same and it's not like you can replace yourself as coach in Madden 12. All you can do is switch teams.
* You have less control over your team. Example: If your special teams unit sucks, there is very little you can do about it other than generally improving the overall quality of our players because you can't look forward to replacing you special teams coordinator at season's end
* All general managers are equal
* There is no approval rating for your performance and no risk of being fired, which removes some of the uncertainty that made Head Coach so compelling. Nothing like being under the gun

The Draft:
Here is where Madden 12 falls flat. Somehow, they have managed to suck all the fun out of the NFL Draft, a quite enjoyable experience in Head Coach 09. There is no ready reference to the draft order, no mock draft to reference and no way to tell what another team's needs (and likely draft strategy) might be. The scouting system is so terrible that you next to nothing about the players in the draft and have to draft blind. Granted, Head Coach 09 might have given you too much information but Madden 12 gives you nowhere near enough and is unrealistic besides, forcing you to scout individuals during pro-days instead of all the players participating in that pro day.

One Noticeable Glitch:
At least, I assume it was not meant to be a feature when a defender intercepted my pass and began to return it, a cone of slowness forming around him as if out of D&D. Each of my players, in turn, as they tried to catch the defender, were slowed to near immobility. The defender wasn't moving any faster than they were but nobody could even approach him.

Statistics:
There is a noticeable difference between the statistics accrued by the AI teams as compared to your team: give up any idea of having a leading tackler. In 15+ seasons I have yet to see anyone come close. This was a problem in Head Coach 09 as well since there are actually several types of football game going on here: the computer simming AI games, you playing your game or super-simming your game. You won't get the same type of statistics.

Running QBs:
AI owned QBs will run - quite a bit - but the same QB if on your team will NOT. If you want Cam Newton to run then you will have to make him run because he won't do it on his own if he is on your team - nor will any other QB even if that QB is fast, identified as a scrambler and your offense set to scramble rather than sit in the pocket. Unless you have good hand-eye coordination, a scrambling QB won't benefit a player at all. It was frustrating to play a season a the Panthers and have Newton run for 0 yards in 16 games for me and then play a game against the Panthers and watch Newton scramble for 150 yards.

Official Player's Guide:
This isn't terribly useful for playing franchise mode in Madden 12, not that it's not a very nice book made out of decent paper and with good graphics. The problem is that very little of the book is dedicated to the franchise mode (4 pages out of 256, plus a partial page at the beginning of the guide). Most of it is about controlling individual players. You will find that people like Ramses Barden, WR is very valuable in Madden 12. This is true if you control him yourself and have good hand-eye coordination. But in franchise mode, the Giants are probably right to release him before the season, as they did in my league. I did pick him up to try it out but though he has Jump 95 and he's 6'6"" if he just stands there and doesn't try to catch the ball (which seems to be the case) none of that matters. The Team Strategy section (pages 88 to 215) is useful but not necessary. Again, it is tailored towards players who control individual players on the field, not franchise mode.",A Franchise Mode Review,1335657600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I quickly became frustrated and gave up on it. However, I picked it up and started playing it again from beginning to end and I am now comfortable in giving it four stars.

I wasn't crazy about dueling at first. I read someone else's comment that all you had to do was keep hitting the ""y"" button and you will eventually win. So I did that for a while and it was totally tedious. Instead, if you use the ""b"" button to block spells, the spells sometimes rebound on your dueling partner and then you can use the ""y"" button to finish them off.  This makes dueling MUCH better! I liked the dueling club portion of the game. Each level has an unlockable character in it.

There is no need to use the stylus in this game. I didn't like that at first....but I actually enjoyed it the more I played it. You use the left and right buttons to scroll through the spells you want to use (shown on the lower screen) and you use the ""x"" button to scroll through your inventory of characters.

I can't speak for others.....but MY copy of this game kept crashing between dueling club levels. However, since I had plenty of money, I decided to try turning off the extras (studs x2, etc) ......and once I did that, my ds stopped crashing.

It is the type of game where there's not really an quest, but you run around, sell, buy, chat with computer controlled villagers, and have a little ""life"". In my opinion, the cover of the game really explains it! It is a fairly big world where the fun never ends. There's always special hidden things to explore.. K.K. Slider at the roost at the bottom of the museum... getting stung by bees.... There are even special events in this little game! I also would like to announce that each villager has different personalities, little games, and things to say. They really seem to show emotion. Life is great in animal crossing as you can dress your character, make new ""friends"", and do lots of fun activities while feeling the satisfaction of buying a good pixel quality game, but we have a couple of problems....

Apart from how fun the game really is, it can be a bit inappropriate as well as mean. Let's start with ""mean to your child."" If you don't save the game, a creepy mole named ""Resseti"" jumps out of the ground near your house when you get on the game and yells at you. He may call you ""nut job"", ""punk"", ""dirty resseter"" and much more while making freakish expressions on his face. He also may make you spell things along the lines of ""I'm stupid"", which i doubt little kids need to build up a strong self-esteem. There is no escaping horrible Resseti, although you can change what he's punishing you with by turning off the power while he's talking and getting back in the game. One of my friends even said that he stayed there for 2 HOURS!!! I wasn't there to see it, but this friend has had animal crossing for quite a long time.

Now, to the part where it can get inappropriate. Some of the NPC villagers asked me questions that made me feel uncomfortable... one once told me about how they hate bathing and how they only stayed in for so long, then turned around and asked me how long i soak in the tub for. I just put a random hour and then they said: Ah, it must be a steam bath. The kind where you sit in the tub so long you sweat? Yay! Dr. S (What they call my character) is sweaty in the bathtub!"" Well, that made me feel a little uncomfortable. This teaches little kids that if some random person walks up to them and asks them a personal question they shouldn't be just giving out to random people that is OK to respond honestly because their ""little game"" did it, and it doesn't stop there. They also once asked me what color some person's long johns are. Some times they ask me if i love them, but i don't think that's too bad as they don't get very detailed. I don't think that it was TOO bad but I'm just giving you a warning.....

Don't get me wrong.. that kind of talk doesn't occur much, and it's not that bad, but i don't really think i like it when they keep asking it again and again. Overall, animal crossing is pretty fun, and i wouldn't hold much against it. I give this game 4 stars. I think it's worth the money, and safe for children, but as it said, there are some parts that i would rather not have.","Good Game, but we have a problem.... or 2....",1334361600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

That's why we were chomping at the bit to play Mega Man X5, because it marks a long-overdue return to MM's 2-D roots.

Unfortunately, the game plays more like a rushed overcorrection than a nostalgic, side-scrolling romp. For example, you can now choose between three playable characters: Zero, X, and Fourth. It's a good idea, but the problem is that the characters are so different that this option actually destroys the fluidity of the gaming experience. In the original Mega Man X titles, you couldn't progress until you found a weapon that could be used to destroy a particular boss. In X5, bosses can be put out of their misery with the Z-Saber and the X-Buster.

But the game's biggest problem is its difficulty. The first law of game design is that a game should provide gradual, continual challenge. X5 just keeps getting easier and easier due to the endless number of checkpoints and unlimited continues. The result is Mega Man with training wheels.

By Mega Man standards, this game is truly a disappointment.

I will be as breif as possible and not spoil the story but definitely talk about the features of the game. In the end, I don't give stars or numbers. I just want other people to examine what I put and see if it would be something that they would like to play. So here goes.

Firstly, I find the game to be interesting. The story gives way to the appearance of Sonic on the cover. You transform in this game between regular Sonic and a Were-Sonic (Wolf). The transformations are cool and the best part is that the levels are built around your transformation. So you won't be regular Sonic and need the wolf powers or anything like that. There are some tedious elements of the levels though in regards to it's platforming elements. There will be jumps that you have to make that you might find annoying due to the wierd way in which Sonic can double jump, but, with a few tries, like all platforming games, you should be able to handle it.

There are some boss fights that are a little unfair at first, however, once you get the hang of what their weaknesses are and learn how to maneuver around them, you will find the right kind of challenge balanced.

The only gripe that I have with the game is the saving structure. It seems to me that Sega is still stuck in the early 2000's. They did this even with Alpha Protocol and I do believe that the way that gaming has advanced so much, there should be no reason why you can't save anytime and anywhere. They do have save points which helps alot though.

Other than that, I found the game to be charming. This is exactly what the Sonic Generations game is built off of as there is also a targeting attack system in this game as well. It makes things extremely smoother because there are some platforms that you have to jump to in which there are enemies. However, with the target/lock system, it allows you to hit and even use momentum against other enemies when attacking which makes the action flow better. Especially those levels where you are going at sonic speeds and don't have too much time to really plan out where you have to jump to.

All and all I would say that this is a very enjoyable game for adults and definitely mild enough for children 6 and up. There is some violence in it when Sonic is in wolf mode as he uses his claws and can grab and throw enemeis and even use enemies to beat other enemies with, but I was fine with that.

Frankly, this is the best PvP game I've seen in years.  If you are looking for a good PvP game, just buy this now.  If you want a fun game to play alone and sail ships around the map by yourself, get Sea Dogs instead.  Not that this game can't be fun solo, but the meat and potatoes comes from fleet vs fleet action and you're not going to be a fleet of 1.  Join up, bring some friends / find some friends and you'll have a blast.

I'll stand by my 4-star rating as opposed to 5-star because frankly the first 10 levels are a bore and the avatar combat (swashbuckling) needs serious technical work before it will be any good, but the ship-to-ship combat is great fun and makes for the best player vs player action you can get today in an MMO, and I've played everything from UO to EVE to WW2O to Planetside to WOW and a bunch in between.

Also, don't think, ""Meh, I'd be joining it too long after release.  I don't want to have to grind XP in the newbie zones before I can have fun.""  This game isn't like that.  At level 43 I have no problem inviting level 7 guildmates to my groups, both for PvP and PvE.  They get a lot of XP by helping me sink level 40 opponents, I don't lose that much XP per ship and they're actually quite helpful, allowing me to kill faster and ultimately level faster and safer myself.  Even a level 7 in a small ship can damage sails, distract the enemy and, if ignored, do some nasty stuff like sailing up to rake the enemy decks with grapeshot.  A level 7 isn't going to take down a level 40 player in PvP but he's far from useless in battle.

In the open sea, you basically have a toy ship which you drive around over the ocean between ports and look for other ships to attack.  This is a simple but nice looking part of the game for navigating on the open sea without actually taking 4 real-time months to get places.

* Sea Combat
This is the real meat and potatoes for this game and I think they've done well with it.  It's not a total ""sea battle simulator"" as Sea Dogs was.  You don't have to manually aim your guns or time your firing with the sea swells, but you do have to deal with wind direction as well as managing your sails, maneuvering to keep targets within the general firing arc of your guns, the type of ammo you want to use (cannon balls vs armor, chains vs sails, grape vs crew, etc) and bleeding ship speed during hard turns.  There are various skills and expendable items you can use during combat to help repair emergency damage to sails, hull, etc.  There are also skills for increasing ship speed or weapon reload time at the expense of something else.  You'll have plenty of things to manage without worrying about the sea swells.

Ramming works -- although it does no damage, you can block an enemy ship, force him to turn by ramming him and generally set him up to be boarded.  You can also protect an ally by getting between him and whoever is shooting at him.  Really, this is some impressive ship to ship combat.  If you played EVE, I can tell you that POTBS ship combat is better than EVE ship combat.

* On foot
There is a ""you"" in this game.  You aren't just a ship.  You can dock with ports and run around but there's also a melee component to the game.

Hand to hand battles come into play during some missions given to you by the NPCs but it's also part of ship to ship boarding.  If you pull alongside an enemy ship, you can attempt to board it and fight the enemy captain and NPC crew using your character and your own NPC crew.

This part of the game is not overly well fleshed out.  You will be disappointed if you come expecting a full blown World of Warcraft type battle experience.  It's more like a fun little meta-game they threw in, and it's not bad.  It reminds me a lot of combat in City of Heroes, actually.

Back to ports, though -- ports are where you'll find another large aspect of the game: crafting.  I was surprised with the depth and thought they've put into crafting, but I suppose it makes sense.  What good is a ship if you don't have something to carry?  Because what good is being a pirate if other people aren't carrying things you can steal from them?  So even if you're a full blown PvP pirate, you have to appreciate the crafting game simply because it gives you something to take from other people.  (Arrr, booty.)

To get started with crafting, you go to a port and create a Warehouse.  Once you have a warehouse you can create resource structures depending on what resources are available at the port.  If there's ""Fertile Soil"" you can grow crops (such a hemp, used in making rope, or maize, used in making cheese or growing livestock).  If there's ""Oak"", you can set up a lumber yard for farming oak.  Etc.  These farms supply resources based on a real-time clock.  So the person who plays 16 hours a day is not able to bring in more resources from a farm than someone who plays 1 hour a day because the farm is basically working 24 hours a day whether you're there or not.  You just need to swing by periodically and collect your resources.

From this, you have the basis for an overwhelmingly player-driven economy.  From the start, the game encourages you to use the auction house to look for player-made goods rather than the NPC store, which sells only very basic things and sells them at much higher prices than players are likely to charge for the same things.  Don't buy your ammo from the NPC ""Fence"" until you've checked the Auction House for player-made ammo which is cheaper.

I do think they can do a bit more with NPC AI, melee battles and PvP, but I think they picked a good time to release and the game is pretty good once you get into the swing of things.  Give it a day or two to get used to the interface and get yourself to level 10 or so and don't be afraid to group up with others and I think you'll be surprised at how much fun this game is.",Avast!,1201478400,28,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

4.0,False,"04 22, 2010",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B001F513VO,Trenton Bennett,"This sequel to the oddball hit Loco Roco falls in the categories of both ""whimsical"" and ""eccentric"".  It's not a puzzle game, but you need to solve puzzles.  It's not a twitch game, but from time to time, the way you twiddle the triggers is everything.  It's not ultra-realistic, and yet physics is an important part of gameplay.

In Loco Roco 2, a world of cute creatures made from simple shapes has been overrun with some odd colorless creatures from another world.  They've corrupted the color with black blobs and it's up to you to put things right.  You play a cute little yellow blob that grows bigger as it finds things to eat.  Movement in Loco Roco 2 consists of using the shoulder buttons to tilt the world this way or that and make your blob hop up and down--and it comes down to timing the tiliting/sliding action with the hops to get the blob to go where you want it to.  Your cute little blob is made up of (and can break itself into) bunches of little blobs, and from time to time that is exactly how you have to get through parts of each level.  Levels vary enough to be interesting, with sliding on ice, bobbing on water, or slipping through pachinko-like tunnels in ""little-blob"" form enjoyable.

Everything seems simplistic on the surface, but it can get fairly complicated if you're one of those people who wants to experience it all:  hidden areas, minigames, alternate side goals and more are embedded in the game.  You can replay levels, and the levels can ""Level Up"" which apparently makes it easier for you to find more goodies.  You also find other characters who become playable as you go along, with slight differences in how they behave.

This colorful, simple-shape world is backed by a soundtrack reminiscent of Sesame Street:  it's very childlike and cheery.  While you're playing the game, it adds to the experience.  However, I've found that anyone *not* playing Loco Roco 2 who gets within earshot finds it annoying (and I can't imagine buying the soundtrack CD that's offered here and actively listening to it outside of the game).  Children will most likely enjoy this game, but smaller children who are just getting into gaming would probably have a hard time understanding some of what is expected of them:  they'd probably be more prone to tilting the PSP and expecting things to roll or slide than they would be able to figure out the shoulder-button mechanics.  I expect that the very small will enjoy watching big brother or sister (or mom or dad) while they play, as its Baby-Einstein graphics can make Loco Roco 2 almost hypnotic at times.

If you like a bit of puzzling and don't mind a bit of arcade button-mashing, Loco Roco 2 will provide you a gaming experience that strays outside of the mainstream.  Its content is definitely safe for children, and makes a nice break from the typical, ""you have bad guys, and you have to shoot/kill/explode/bop 'em on the head"" gameplay mechanic that permeates many games.  Its eccentric style may not be for everyone, and its soundtrack may overrun your tolerance for sweetness, but I think it's just part of an excellently-crafted package.  I haven't found everything (or even completely beaten) Loco Roco 2 yet, but I definitely see myself getting there.","For Inner Children and Outer Children, too...",1271894400,,,

If you never played the first game then you may be a little lost as to what's going on storywise in SC2, so I'd recommend doing some reading up on what the story is all about.  There are some cinematics and dialogue that explain a bit of the past, though.  I think the story is great and while I'm not finished yet with the campaign I cannot wait to see (SPOILER ALERT!!!) what happens to Kerrigan at the end.

The graphics are pretty solid. Colors are bright and vivid, animations are smooth, and the CG work is excellent.  I give props to Blizzard for keeping up with the times for once (everyone knows how outdated Diablo 2's graphics were, lol).  I give the graphics a 4 out of 5.

Sound is also superb.  The original music is back, with slight modifications, as well as some new stuff that's pretty cool.  All the sounds are flawless, and the voice acting is superb.  I give the sound a 5 out of 5.

Presentation gets a 5 out of 5 as well.  The menus are nifty and easy to navigate.  The battlecruiser flying in the background is also real cool.

Gameplay is, of course, the bread and butter of SC2.  If you enjoyed the first game then you will enjoy this one as well.  I'll start with the pros first.  The campaign is great and although some people say it's short, it is fairly long for today's standards.  I'm 17 of 26 missions in and around 10 hours of play time.  While the story isn't as huge as Warcraft's, Blizzard did an excellent job of making the story an emotional experience for what it is.  I also love the new characters they've added.  Tychus is especially cool.  There is plenty of added replay value in the campaign, as there are lots of achievments to aquire accross all difficulty levels.

While the campaign is an overall satisfying experience, multiplayer is somewhat of a let down compared to the original.  Blizzard re-vamped Battle.net and it isn't what it used to be.  It works more like Xbox Live or PSNetwork in regards to the matchmaking system.  There are no longer chat rooms, no clans can be made, and the custom games are lacking compared to SC1.  I have yet to see a top vs bottom map and that was one of the most popular maps played.  The map editor is obviously more difficult to use because of all the extra utilities and technology included.  Another shocker is the lack of LAN play.  Blizzard did this because of pirating issues but it upset a ton of people, not including myself.  I feel that with how widespread broadband internet is today,  LAN really isn't needed.  Just my opinion though.  With all the stuff that Blizzard left out of the new Battle.net experience, I am still enjoying the heck out of playing online.

Another thing that made a ton of people mad was the excusion of the zerg and protoss campaigns.  Blizzard is definitely going to get their money from people with SC2 because most likely each expansion is going to cost $40.  So, for the full SC2 experience you will most likely be shelling out $140 for the entire game when it's complete, and if you bought the collector's edition then...well you know.  I really don't have an issue with this since I am not hard up for cash but it does seem like a company of Blizzard's stature does not need to rip people off; especially since they are raking in the money from WoW.  I give the gameplay a 4 out of 5

Anyways, with all the quirks about SC2 there is so much to like about it that I have to put the nonsense aside and enjoy this game for myself.  If you are a fan of RTS games and the original SC, then you cannot go wrong with SC2.  Just like almost any game, it's easy to learn but difficult to master.

First I would like to point out that the game has taken a lot of flak for it's violent content. It is true that there is gore in the game, but any seasoned Quake, UT, or Half-Life players (If you have never played those you should not be reading this) will find it's content little more than another day at the office. Yes you can blow off limbs or blow open a guy's guts. However that graphics are so dated that this seems unrealistic, do our guts really look like pvc tubes?
Another thing, the graphics are OLD. While a lot of the Q2 engine code has been updated, it still does not escape it's basic thresholds. The level design however it impressive at times. The models also are not too shabby considering the engines' age. It even uses alpha channels. Even though some of the shiny textures on objects I would not think to be actually shiny.  It is a shame really that one trip outdoors tells you that the engine was around before most people today had the internet.
There are some quirks in the game desing. Each time the game boots up it warns you that this graphicly depicks real world combat. Yet the game fails to be realistic, it's almost a joke. Things can stick to walls (that are not supposed too), grenades have fixed trajectories,  tanks can be taken out with sinper rifles, not matter how many missles you fire at a door it will still stand, the enemies lack an unterstanding of doors and grenades and the weapons have only a vague likeness to real world counterparts. Also you earn money, but to what with it? It is never a factor in buying weapons. For that matter you will pick up weapons and ammo in the game, it doesn't matter what you picked out before hand.  Also stealth is supposed to matter, the AI is so basic it does not.

1.)  I was shocked that there were separate USB cables for each of the lights that had to be plugged into my computer.  1 for each!  I don't have that many USB ports on my laptop when I include all the other things that are plugged into it, in fact I had to unplug something, and now bought a USB hub.

2.) In addition, you have to plug each unit into the wall.  Granted it's one adapter with two lines on it, but that's 4 wires (2 from the USB lines) and a lot of tangling going on for just two lights.

3.) Even though both units were plugged into the wall; upon plugging them into my computer (a very powerful laptop which was plugged into the wall as well) the computer shut down accesss to the USB drive b/c of a power surge these units caused.  Not a good sign, this is the first time in my life something like this has happened.

4.) After inserting the installation CD the program didn't install correctly; had to re-do it for whatever reason.

5.) The troubleshooting instructions for when the lights fail to work are bogus.  They did not work.

SOLUTION:  It's simple, but so many programs/devices nowadays don't need to have it done that I've forgotten about it: restart the darn computer and everything (lights) turned on.

Afterwards,  things went much smoother.  The program automatically detects what is installed on your computer that can produce lighting effects.  Some programs, like Call of Duty 2 weren't detected, but when launched, the lights continued to function.

These lights, while small, are very bright!  I wouldn't recommend looking directly at them (even when you adjust them to low intensity) and they should be set so that they are essentially reflecting off of a wall, otherwise you see the 3 separate light bulbs giving off 3 lights, when in essence and actuality they merge at a focal point a foot or two away to produce a single color.

When listening to music I have to admit the colors they produced to match the music was almost natural.  I was very impressed.

When playing COD2, well, they didn't do too much.  Basically the reflected a red light to indicate where the bullet was coming from.  And frankly the fact that the game itself gives you that warning, and I'm so focused on the game, the lights are really almost not there at all.

Overall, these are really nice substitutes to set a mood (e.g. to replace candles) when listening to music.  Or maybe to add a more colorful experience to a movie, and it may work better for some other genre of games.

In general, the fact that gaming, music, and video is now moving into a 4D environment (i.e. special seats, fans, lights, etc..) with lots of open source applications is a very nice trend to see.  I guess in about 5-10 years one can build a pretty nice 4D experience right at home.

If you want headphones so you can listen to music, but also want the mic for gaming or Skype, then I'd pass on these, personally. Even tho the product description says ""well defined highs"", in actuality they are muffled, and cloudy. When I plugged these in to a headphone splitter, and listened to them next to better quality headphones, the difference was huge. (Tho maybe its unfair to pay less than twenty dollars for headphones, then expect them to sound like two hundred dollar headphones.) Earphones I've tested in this price range, offer much better highs, than this set. I was listening to a Rolling Stone's song, and wondered, ""What happened to the guitar solo?"" It was there, but barely to be heard.  Also, these are not the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. There's no padding on the headrest, and the padding around the ears is a bit tight. After an hour or two, you're sure to have headphone fatigue, if you have a large skull.

ON the other hand, if you want gaming headphones, for playing video games, I think these would work great. In fact, if you're gaming for any length of time, the lack of high end would protect your hearing from nerve damage. If you are only listening to people talking, bottom heavy bomb explosions, or gun fire, these headphones will work fine. The mic flips down for on line chat with your gaming partners, or flips up and out of the way, when you need better vision of the screen. There's an ON/OFF switch, for the mic function, right next to the volume control.  I liked the volume control, in case you're getting sick of hearing that video music loop, or have one too many gun shots go off right in your ear.  Just turn it down for a second, while you concentrate on the game controls.  The mic and the headphones work with separate 1/8th inch jacks. Also, the design is simple, and contemporary. For gaming headphones, at this price, you should be happy. My own opinion is FOUR AND A HALF STARS, with the deduction due to the lack of highs, and sonic clarity and response.

On one hand, it's a blast to play, and you can easily lose 30-60 hours of your life to the streets of liberty city.  On the other hand, there really isn't anything here that you haven't seen before.

PROS: Terrific graphics, awesome ""sandbox"" (I'm starting to hate that term) gameplay, the most realistic city ever rendered.  Tons of game content, great voice acting and production values, tons of cool music to listen to, and the deepest and most mature GTA game yet.

CONS: Underneath the next-gen looks... it's the same game.  The control, which had supposedly been revamped, still stinks.  You spend tons of time battling the camera (especially in close-quarters combat and when driving).  The new aiming system works pretty well, though it's not foolproof.  The biggest problem I had, however, was the canned, cliched and repetitive mission formats.  Virtually all of the missions follow one of three structures: 1)Nikko must kill someone.  Drive to where they are, shoot them.  2)Nikko must chase someone, THEN kill them.  Get in your car, get really frustrated at the unrealistic physics, kill the target.  3)Nikko must recover drugs/guns/etc from bad guy.  The chase scenes are particularly annoying, as run-of-the-mill cars will suddenly outrun your high-end sports car.  The new car physics model is a case of overcompensation- in trying to make it less arcady, the developers have made it unrealistically floaty.

The interpersonal relationships is another gimmick (much like altering your body type in San Andreas) which gets old really quick.  There are no properties to buy, meaning you can expect to do a lot of driving between safehouses the game gives you.  There are no checkpoints, meaning that many longer missions will have you throwing the controller at the wall when you fail and have to repeat them from the very beginning (though Roman's taxi service does help a bit).

Conclusion:  I still had a lot of fun with this GTA, but it also became readily apparent how the core gameplay has NOT evolved since GTA III.

A unique battle system, lots of difficulty and a good storyline too.  When I heard of the sequel, I waited and waited and when it finally got here it was very well done and the battle system was even refined.  But the game didn't have that great storyline and the difficulty that the first one gave off was lost.  But this was made up for with tons of sidequests and great character developement.
The gameplay is much like the first one.  However, there's a difference.  You'll be asked LOTS of question that you must make a choice too.  This helps you develope your character. The choices you make affect the dialogue in the game and how others view your character. Thus, you're developing your OWN chracter.  Also, characters get nicknames in this, which also define how they're viewed.  Interesting boost of gameplay (and try and find ALL the nicknames for EVERY character).
The battle system has been a little redone.  Where as in the first one, normal battles could get teadiously long, this one allows for you to shorten those battles.  For example, there are arts that add AP to your AP gauge (I'm assuming that most of you have played the first one) and they never subtract.  Then you've got super arts which detract from your AP gauge.  The only way to fill up an AP gauge is to use normal arts.  This is a good idea but there are tricks to the point where you could use the same combo over and over full of a bunch of normal arts and the use a super art or a hyper art (A VERY POWERFUL attack) and NEVER lose AP. This made the game severely easy and I was already doing 25000 HP of damage to enemies by level 30! That's really sad (and considering I'm a maniac at raising levels my level 90 characters killed the final boss in one round). You have art techniques that are much too powerful making the difficulty level of this game seem like a joke.
The storyline in the game was not as good as the first Legaia.  You've got no serus or ra-serus this time.  Instead each chracter has an ""Origin"" because they are a ""Mystic.""  The main guy is trying to destory the world and revive it with only mystics or something like that...must've dozed off halfway through the storyline.  Why? Because the story moves at an incredibly slow pace.  Not only that but the way its told seems like a rip off of the very first FINAL FANTASY game!  You go around collecting the sacred stones so that you can restore the world back to the way it was. Sort of like the role the crystal's played in Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy V.  The dialogue is also a little annoying at times as there are parts where some of it is useless and meaningless.  But at least whatever your next task to do is always highlighted in blue making it easier to never get lost.
Wandering on the world map isn't slow like it was in Legend of Legaia.  But that's because you can't explore the overworld at all. I'm not mad at this very much but it makes so that you must talk to another character to reveal the location of the next town or dungeon.  There aren't any hidden dungeons either. The only hidden locations on the world map are shops.  But the shops are very useful...
As far as secrets and sidequests go this game is chalk full of them.  There is a hunter's guild to do which contains several sidequests that provide a challenge.  There is also a hidden dungeon in town that has 100 battles to do (and that takes a hell of a long time!).  Also, your chracters are always hanging out around town when you visit them.  Talking to them reveals different things and each time you leave the town and come back they're in a different location.  This helps further develop the chracters and gives the game more interface.
THe music in the game is somewhat weak.  Battle music is great but dungeons are annoying.  They also took tunes from ""Legend of Legaia"" and that music was beautiful. The problem was that they took TOO MANY tunes. While some are remastered and played smoother, they got annoying at times.
The game presents a long 40 hour or so and it's A WHOLE LOT MORE if you decide to attempt all the sidequests in the game and learn all the nicknames and such.
OVERALL: I could tell you more but the game is immensely huge giving for much more RPG goodness than any other RPG I've seen before.

Halo 2 is a good game.  It's the best xbox live game to-date.  However, it's not perfect.  It's not the greatest game of all time.  Most importantly, the only mark it has made on history is single day sales.

That said, let's get to the bottom line about Halo 2.
The Good:
-Graphics
-A good online multiplayer setup
-Fun
-Sound/Soundtrack
-Dual Wielding is pretty cool.

The Bad:
-The Ending.
-Weapons are still unbalanced, just in a different way.
-Levels are still repetitive.
-Some Xbox live players are, for lack of a better term, annoying as sin.
-No tanks in Multiplayer (in optimatch, at least).

Some Elaboration on the Bad Points:
I will not discuss the ending, as to not spoil it.  It's just bad.  Really, really, really bad.

The weapons are kinda irksome.  If they had left the pistol as what it was in Halo 1, it might have balanced out what they've created.  The problem is the energy sword.  Most of the maps have 1.  Short of the rocket launcher, or a well placed grenade (and that is assuming they don't hit you from behind), good luck getting off enough shots to kill someone with the sword.  Granted, if you can keep your distance, sniping is an option.  Or if you're lucky the shotgun will do it, but for the most part, it's pretty unstopable.  Which is annoying.

Equally annoying is the lack of tanks in the multiplayer.  The tank balances out the warthog, ghost, and banshee.  Without it, the only balancing item is the rocket launcher.  Just seems lacking.

One big complaint in Halo 1 was the levels you had to repeat backwards.  While this never happens in Halo 2, the levels themselves are internally repetitive.  For example, big room, corridor, identical big room, identical corridor, slightly different big room, slightly different corridor, etc.  There could definately be more variety.

Finally, while I like xbox live and the rank/optimatch system, there are a lot of annoying people on xbox live who you'll run into.  It's unavoidable, and there's no real way to fix it, but it's there, so be ready for it.

Bonus DVD: While cool, it's not essential.  Pretty interesting to watch, though, and makes a lot of sense of the news and delays we saw waiting for this game.  But, don't watch it until you finish the game, it has plot spoilers.

Bottom Line: Good game you should probably have if you have xbox live.",Vaguely Unsatisfying,1107734400,4,,

Though accelerated (a couple hours per game instead of 40 hours) and simplified (less micromanagement), Civ Rev still feels rich and enjoyable.  There's still plenty of room to plot a variety of paths to victory and pursue them in any number of ways.  It's a smaller sandbox than desktop Civilization/Alpha Centauri, but you can do a lot inside of it.  You can focus on defense, hunker down with great people and block your opponents victory paths with espionage.  You can dominate the world with tanks, artillery and even nuke your enemies.  There are fantastic exploration bonuses that encourage you to explore each new world as early as possible.

I've read the difficulty varies from port to port, for example, the iOS version is less difficult.  On the DS version, the AI actually cheats in Deity difficulty mode, big time, and that's a good thing.  I'd much rather have a cheating AI that can actually challenge me than no challenge at all.  One of the clues that it cheats is if you leave an enemy galley from the earliest era alone, it will continue unloading units of increasing tech until the end of the game without moving to reload.  It's first unit will be a warrior and its last will be artillery.  There are also instances in which civs which don't have the special projects (because you or another civ does have them)or other means to achieve rapid economic, scientific or cultural advancement will (apparently) get extra multipliers towards one of those ends.  This is a far more effective cheat for the AI than the bottomless galleys.  You have to really scramble to prevent these surprise bonuses from winning a quick victory.  Even once you're really good at the game, this mechanism can keep things interesting.

Though as mentioned by another reviewer, it's tough to compare BF3 to MW3, but since they're both FPS that have had long-awaited released so close to each other... I'm going to compare them. lol Since BF3 was released before MW3, I played the campaign all the way through before playing MW3 at all. So I had plenty of BF3 playtime under my cap. Within 15 minutes of starting the MW3 campaign, I instantly thought it was a much more ""polished"" version of BF3. The fire fights are just much smoother and the weapons seem to be easier to use... not more effective, just easier to use. Maybe the holographic sites are easier to use? Not sure. Just felt more fluid. Although both campaigns are still linear, MW3 allows you to cut through buildings, or often times completely behind buildings, instead of heading straight up the alley way. It seems as though the ""in play"" area of MW3 was just wider overall. This REALLY adds to the realism and fun aspect of the game. Allows you to flank enemies etc on your own. Something I didn't see as much of in BF3 (BF3 forced flanking once in awhile, not your own decision). MW3 allows you to take control of a few aerial attacks from a C130, Predator Drone, etc. Thought it was very cool. BF3 allows you to drive a tank and dog fight in a jet. Fun, but just so unpolished and borderline cheesy (nearly impossible to die during them for example). One feature I'm not sure how I feel about yet... the spec ops mode. This is similar to the zombie mode of previous modern warfares. Waves of regular enemies while you upgrade and purchase new weapons. It's fun. But I just don't seem to be having the ""blast"" I had with the zombie missions on MW2.

PROS:
1)Controls seem very familiar. Everything seems the same as MW2.
2)Solid, fluid, nearly perfect firefights. Impressed me even after lots of playing BF3.
3) Certainly no run-and-gunning here. Crank it up to Veteran difficulty and there isn't a chance in hell you're running through this game.
4)Spec Ops section of game. Nearly limitless replay possibilities for those that don't play online.

CONS:
1)Cover material not realistic. You can hide behind a thin piece of plywood, plastic jugs, etc to protect you from machine gun fire. It seems if the object isn't interactive (falls when you shoot it for example) then it's automatically bullet proof.
2)Teammate effectiveness is directly tied to how far/fast you move up. If you stand in one spot, your teammates rarely hit anyone and never score kills. However if you move up quickly, your teammates move up as well and suddenly become very effective killing anyone close to you. It's a simple flaw designed to move the game forward and make it a little more believable. But us FPS veterans can tell...
3)Graphics are decent, but nothing special. We're nearing the end of 2011. We've had many games with absolutely stellar graphics that have been released. I'd like to see that here as well.

Fighter's Uncaged presents precisely this dilemma, and its low scores across the board indicate that it is useless, if not entirely broken as many critics have claimed.

Having played through the whole tutorial and successfully combated all the introductory fighters (with a flawless record no less), I feel it is time to set the record straight.  There are a number of points about this game that must be heeded in order for it to be in any way entertaining or useful.

1) Kids beware - it isn't that the game is that terribly challenging (come on critics, really?) but the movements required to perform maneuvers are precise.  Thus, if you aren't precise and are prone to throwing your arms and legs out haphazardly trying to hit your opponent, you will be foiled.  Thus, this game is simply not kid friendly as most kids (and over-weight critics) have a tendency to do just that - flail around to no avail.

2) It works... but do you? - I'm not in top condition by any means, but I am physically fit enough to know that out-of-shapers will simply be frustrated by this game.  This game not only requires stamina but also precision, which if you are out of shape you simply will not have.  The repeated whine from the critics has been ""it doesn't work, wah*wah*wah"".  The reality is that it does work, just fine, but it doesn't work if you can't control your limbs enough to accurately perform the gestures.  It's pretty much that simple: if you can't properly activate the Kinect with your movements, then it will have to try to guess what you are doing, and this can result in sporadic movements and lag.  If, however, you properly learn the moves (on both sides of the body, which is necessary, not superfluous as the critic claims) and remember their motions accurately, then you will have no problem.

3) Fitness = Practice - This may come as a surprise to the gaming critic world, but if you want to continue reviewing Kinect games you are going to have to get in shape to do it.  The fact is that games such as Fighters Uncaged require a minimum level of fitness in order for it to work correctly.  Further, it seems that the expectation of many people, critics included, when appropriating this game is that it should play like Street Fighter or Mortal Combat, plug and play so to speak.  The reality is that you have to be physically conditioned enough in order to actually perform the gestures necessary and have the reflexes necessary to keep up in combat.  If you were actually going to become a professional fighter you wouldn't start by booking a fight, you would take time to prepare and train before booking your first fight.  This game is no different.  If you can't pass through the tutorials then you need to keep practicing until you can properly execute all the different techniques.

4) Is it for me? - For any of you out there that are worried by the overwhelming negative critic response to this game, so long as you take into account the above mentioned warnings, you should at least give it a try.  If you are like me, you will find an entertaining game that after about two hours of training you can successfully plug away at and will in the process get a fantastic workout.  The more you play (practice) the better you will get and the more fluid your motions will be.

The controls are pretty much the same from WWE '12, which is a good thing.  It's very easy to learn and start competing without getting pummeled because you can't remember the three or four button combo needed to perform a suplex or a body slam.

The game has various modes including the normal WWE RAW/Smackdown ""season"" and the newly added ""WWE Attitude Era"" mode.  The Attitude mode basically takes you through history starting back with the formation of Degeneration X and the progression to present day WWE.  Now, this is a very cool idea and opens up the opportunity to play as very cool wrestlers such as Mankind, The New Age Outlaws, Stone Cold, etc.  The one issue I have with the Attitude mode is that, if you want to unlock certain bonuses such as new wrestlers, you must not only win the matches set for you, but you must perform certain actions during the match.  For example, you are Shawn Michaels wrestling the Undertaker.  You must win by pinfall...AND you must perform Sweet Chin Music twice, hit the Undertaker with a chair, successfully land an elbow drop from the top rope to the OUTSIDE of the ring and perform at least 3 taunts.  I mean, seriously?  Isn't it enough to just win the match?  Nope.  Some of the matches aren't that demanding in terms of the ""extras"" that you must perform, but it's annoying nonetheless.

And while I'm on the subject of unlocking bonus material, that's another negative aspect of this game in my opinion.  You do start with a decent stable of wrestlers, but there are SO many more available and you must unlock them all by performing various feats in the game.  I guess I'm just an old fashioned MK type of guy who wants the instant gratification of having all available fighters at my disposal.  If your favorite wrestler is Bret Hart, then you want to play as Bret Hart.  Not win the Diva's championship in a lumberjack match to unlock him.  I suppose some gamers consider this a reason to put long hours into the game and look at it as a plus.  I'm just not one of those guys who plays games over and over again to win all of the trophies, so to me, it's an annoyance.

Another thing I'd like to see is a living roster option similar to sports games such as NBA 2K13 or MLB The Show.  WWE constantly shuffles its active roster and introduces new characters.  After 3 or 4 months, the WWE '13 roster was out of date.  There is downloadable content available for SOME new wrestlers (Ryback, for example), but the DLC is fairly limited and the updates were eventually halted.  I suppose this is a tactic that Madden fans know well.  Force you to buy next year's edition if you want the new players.  Oh well.

Overall, this is a very fun game for casual and especially hardcore WWE fans.  It has the content, the controls, the graphics, the music, the customization and everything else a wrestling fan could ask for.  I can't think of a better wrestling game I've played.

4.0,False,"10 28, 2014",A1E8EXMWOA7RT7,B00GT3PS68,Piaw Na,"My brothers gave me a PS4 on my birthday, so the first thing I did was to download and fire up Resogun. I wasn't able to get into Housemarquee's previous big outing on the PS3, Super Stardust HD, because it was simply too hard. The original asteroids game just wasn't this hard.

Resogun's the spiritual successor to Defender, If you grew up in the 80s as a kid, you'll remember that Defender was amazingly, incredibly hard. The arcade box had 5 buttons and one joystick, and being an arcade game, had only one difficulty level: hard. Like Super Stardust HD, I expected to get my ass handed to me for about an hour and then I'd give up in frustration to try more modern games.

To my surprise, Resogun's easy difficulty level with unlimited continues allowed me to not only complete all 5 stages of the game, but also taught me how to get good enough to finish the game without continues a second time with a second ship. That's a first for me as far as an arcade style game is concerned, and that I continued to play despite finish the game once is a testament to how much fun the game is. Defender was never this much fun! I'm even tempted to bump u the difficulty level another time.

Like the original game, Resogun has you piloting a space ship through a horizontally wrapped world. Unlike the original, you can pilot the ship in one direction while firing in the opposite, though you cannot fire in any axis other than the horizontal. Enemies spawn and come at you almost constantly, though you can clear the board and gain a breather. As opposed to the hyperspace button, you have a ""boost"" button, which lets you zip around the board at speed. There's also an over-drive button, which puts the game into slow motion and turns your weapon into a solid beam that scorches enemies. Both buttons need to be recharged over time.

Finally, of course, there's the smart bomb, which clears the screen of enemies. There are enough differences from the original to knock you for a loop the first time you hit them. For instance, you can only pick up one human at a time, unlike the original. And rather than just picking it up, you can also deliver the human to an exit point to ""save the human"". Another interesting point of difference is that the humans rather than being free standing at start, begin by being locked into prisons, and when keepers show up, you have to destroy them to free a human for you to save.

The game is a scintillating cluster of colors, pixels, boxes, and moving pieces that are both retro and modern at the same time. The scrolling display is rendered in a 3D cylindrical view, and the music is as kinetic as you would expect. It takes you a split second at each introduction of a new enemy to figure out what it's doing and how best to attack it, and the same applies to the boss fights. After a single play through, certain events finally get a chance to filter into your consciousness and you start paying attention to them. ""Keeper Detected"", for instance, is an audio cue to let you know that those new enemies that are showing up have to be destroyed for you to free up a human. Once you've destroyed those, a shooting star animation takes place on the far side of the planet and you have to race there to rescue your newly freed charge. Fortunately, Housemarquee chose not to allow you to accidentally shoot your humans.

One of the best things about video games is that the good ones let you feel like a kid again. And Resogun definitely is one of the good ones. While I wouldn't get a PS4 just for Resogun, it's definitely worth picking up once you have one.","A great update to ""Defender""",1414454400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PS4 Digital Code'}",

It is by far the best Mech game in a long time. There is definetly some ties in this game to other Armored core games and to Chromehounds but this game strikes a nice balance of the good stuff in those games. There is a steap learning curve but it is not to bad for Mech game fans. It just comes with the territory. The customization options are huge and the gameplay is suprisingly smooth and natural feeling. It didn't take me long at all to catch on to the controls. The only time I have noticed that can be a pain is when climbing buildings. Generally this works well but sometimes your mech will want to fly off in the other direction or you won't be high enough up on a structure to be able to launch off of it. Not game changing by any means but something you will notice and it will make you have to be more precise in your movement.

This is definitely a multiplayer game. All the story missions and side missions can be played together and for the competitive Conquest mode you will want as many people as you can get on your team. This will help in many aspects of the game. You can create your own team or join another team. I would not advise making your own if you are going to play solo. You can also loan out your services to other teams if you are just playing alone. There is an actual story to this game but I cant say that it really matters or that I have been able to follow along with it effectively but the missions involved in the story are pretty challenging and will put your team to the test. They are a lot of fun and rewarding. It is definitely a good build up to the competitive aspect of the game. Which will be the largest aspect of the game.

In closing if you are like me and wishing another Chromehounds would come along then this is your best bet and you should pick it up now. I am not a huge Armored Core fan but this game is top notch. If you are looking for a change from the normal shooter and want a more in depth multiplayer game then you should definitely at least rent it.",Best Mech game in a long time,1332892800,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

It was a blog that was picked up by many news sites.  What it did not address is the fact that when a game is good for the Wii, it is simply amazing.  Mario Galaxy and now Mario Kart fall into this category.

I have now had time to play the game for a week and am totally hooked.  I have been playing Kart since it was out for the N64.  This game has many, many things going for it including new courses but even better, some of the best courses from the past reappear.

The game play itself is fun.  I had read some previews slighting the game because the wheel created control problems.  I assumed that the problem would be that it is too sensitive causing the driving to constantly overcompensate and go off course.  WRONG!  I have found the wheel to have just enough `play' in it to allow for a great experience.  It is also really quite fun to be sitting on the couch holding this wheel and steering.  The best part is when you catch yourself leaning into turns as if it will help.

For the Wii, I would list this as a must have.  One of my keys being that you can sit and play for hours or if you just need a quick fix, you can play a couple of courses in 10 minutes.

The main reason I give it 4/5 overall is the multiplayer but the issue is not one with this game but rather a Wii issue and that being the lack of a headset.  I am still surprised that they provide no way to communicate with your other players.  I am scheduled to play against my nephew this weekend but I have not figured out how we will chat during play to decide on courses or what have you.  This seems to be a huge weakness in the online options of the Wii and unfortunately, I am reflecting it on my rating.  In the future, if the headset does come out, I will try to remember to reflect that here.

If you have a Wii and want the full range of experiences the must have games now include:

* Mario Kart
* Mario Galaxy
* Link's Crossbow Training
* Wii Play

Its hard for any game to live up to that kind of frenzy of expectation.  However,  I have to admit, I still think it is a more enjoyable game than Halo for the following reasons.
1. Controlling a squad allows for more strategy and manuvering than controlling a single player.  The ability to sneak, scout, and snipe with specialist characters adds an element not present in Halo.
2. Unlike Halo this game has a built in navigator with an arrow that always points north.  I know this seems like a minor point, but if you have ever spent 45 minutes wandering directionless in a cavern or ship in Halo you will appreciate the value of this feature.
The graphics are excellent!
The responsiveness of the game to the controller is great.
Two minor critisisms:
1. The character ""Hawk"" is too weak.  Even when held in reserve, at the first encouter with combat she dies.  Her special ability (invisibility) does not last enough time to be very useful.  When she runs out of stamina it can take 5 minutes of doing nothing waiting for her to regenerate.
2.  The game does not take full advantage of squad based tactic to win.  There are many portions of the game where the ""run-and-gun"" approach work just as well as the tactical/careful approach.

Sadly it throws subtly out the window far too many times and just ends up just being another ""shoot this to move forward"" game albeit one with fantastic atmosphere and setting. Bright falls sounds and  feels like a breathing world and all the inhabitants truly feel alive when they interact with you they show  varied emotions to the point you'll care for some of them.

The narration by Alan wake really ties and makes the game feel like your in his shoes. His voice sounds like one that you can relate to if you yourself were experiencing a waking nightmare. A lot of what makes the game and the character of Alan wake special is his determination to find his wife and all the hardship he goes through as he feels the conflict is his own doing. The game will keep you interested storywise but I feel the gameplay is very lacking.

Although Alan is a ordinary man he quickly finds himself using firearms with precise aim and dodging like he's a action hero. Maybe he wrote himself having these physical feats? That's my interpretation at least.

I really wanted Alan wake to be true horror title but it stumbles in its own genre. I really like Bright falls its a superb setting and atmosphere. Also wouldn't it be cool if it was the mirror town to Silent Hill. A horror in the daylight kind of town.

4.0,True,"10 9, 2011",A1UYKK9HTOUWS3,B000FRU0NU,Horace Christopherson,"Overall this is a great game. I'm a hardcore Halo 1/Halo 2 fan and like many others, were quite disappointed with Halo 3. Since we have that experience of what Halo used to be like, we tend to underrate new Halo games.

Let's go over some things...

Cons:

1) The Halo 2 multiplayer maps were perfect. Beaver Creek, Lockout, Ivory Tower, Midship - all amazing. The Halo 3 maps are disheartening. If you've never played Halo 2 then you have nothing to compare them to and thus are avoiding disappointment, which is a good thing. The Halo 2 map remakes (like Blackout) are another huge disappointment, as the changes they made were horrible.

2) Ranking up in online multiplayer is much easier than before. Great for noobs who play once a week - bad for skilled players who deserve higher ranks without being grouped with unskilled players. Halo's advantage was that it was easy to rank down and harder to rank up. It seems they are becoming more lenient with the ranking up process and are making it more like other games (such as Call of Duty) where everyone can easily rank up.

3) No one plays online anymore. Since Halo 3, there has been ""Halo 3: ODST"" and ""Halo: Reach"". Everyone is now playing Reach. In H3, it's hard to find matches at times, especially if you're with a friend with a high rank difference. It's not unlikely for me to play with the same group of players all night long. This gets boring fast. It's much funner when you know hundreds of thousands of people are playing online, all competing with each other.

4) The campaign sucked. I could care less about campaigns, but H1 and H2 campaigns were fun. H3 was boring and seemed re-hashed. I beat it in a couple hours.

5) Too many weapon additions. I like the idea of new weapons, but I don't like what they added.

6) The sword was rendered almost useless. In H2 all you had to do was switch weapons and lunge. Now, you have to wait like 2 seconds to pull the thing out. Which means the only time you can use it is when you're prepared to use it (such as when you're behind a corner and have time to pull it out).

7) Last but not least, there's still a huge amount of ""BS!"". All games have it. It's when you're running behind a corner and some how they killed you even though you know you were at an angle they couldn't have shot you. Or when you lunge to melee someone and some how they assassinated you while you are looking at them. Or how your sniper was centered in on their gut, 2 inches away, but somehow the bullet went through them? The list goes on and on. I love Halo, but I scream at my TV all day long because of all the unbelievable, unrealistic, ""BS!"" they have in the game.

Pros:

1) My biggest complaint with H2 was the button combos and the BR+Plasma Pistol combo. In H3, they made the Plasma Pistol less accurate (doesn't follow someone around corners/from long distances) and not as much ammo. They also took out the button combos so people can't cheat.

2) The ""Needler"" was improved and it's much more of a go-to weapon, although I wish you could still dual wield them.

3) The biggest ""Pro"" of Halo 3 as well as all other Halo games is that it caters to skill. What I mean by that is a great Halo player that advances his or her skill can do things that aren't possible in other games, regardless of how good you are. A great Halo player can win a battle that doesn't start in their favor, such as someone shooting you first. In games like Call of Duty or Battlefield, when someone shoots you first, you almost always die unless by some miracle you can get behind a wall or cover. Skill in games like COD and BF are camping, waiting for people to run by, sitting in the bushes, staying on the outskirts of the battlefield and shooting others before they even see you. Skill in Halo is proper usage of your controls. Correct grenade timing. Maneuvering back and forth, jumping and what have you to avoid being shot or getting blown up. It's melee'ing at the right times, crouching when necessary to avoid radar.

People that call Halo ""Gaylo"" or whatever are usually people that suck at playing. They're used to games that cater to people who just pull the trigger to get good. Who sit and camp to get good. Those are not fun games. They're entertaining - but you won't find dedicated players like you find with Halo. Halo is in a league of it's own, and it's a shame more games aren't like it.

To sum up Halo 3:

It's a great game but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone new. It's too late to play online multiplayer and the campaign sucks. Only buy this if you're going through all the old Halo games just to play the campaign and say that you did it. Everyone else, get Halo Reach - that's where it'll be for the next year or so. After Halo 4 comes out, that's where most will be then, and we can only hope they make it a great game as well.",Some words of warning,1318118400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

To say that T4 was ""highly anticipated"" is an understatement. It the granddaddy of PS2 fighters, and in the past the series has always offered something new and different. Not this time. If you've play T3 on PS1, then you'll be familiar with pretty much everything in offered here. Tekken's control system is firmly established now and while both satisfying and easy to use, it lacks the sense of complete control that Sega 's VF4 provides. While playing through the single player game, it soon feels more like a rhythmic button-masher session than a orchestrated fight. With each new game in the series, the back story has gotten more and more complicated (and I've played em all a billion times, so beileve me I know) so much so that in T4 the intricate web of tales hardly explains why all these fighters are beating each other up, and has no relavance whatsoever. If your a longtime fan (like me) though, some of it is mildly intresting, and in many cases the story provides a sense of closure for long-standing characters in the series. You'll get the most fun, like with any fighting game playing against a friend (and if you don't have those, there's always T4's Force mode, and I truly do feel sorry for you). The character selection offers a broad range of fighting styles and the walled arenas provide some intreting possibilities for completely one -sided matches. That said, it's a good fighting game but in the end it's just T3 with new 3D backgrounds, characters and environments and that's about it. VF4 blew the pants off this one.

I just recently finished recorded my playthrough of this game and i am currently uploading my playthrough of Opposing Force unto Youtube (at the time of this review).

This game was supposed to be a Sega Dreamcast exclusive but because of how underrated the Dreamcast was, it just became a PC exclusive and it worked out well.

Released 3 years after Half-Life was released and 2 years after Opposing Force was released, the GoldSrc Engine was looking a bit dated so they released a High Definition Model Pack along side Blue Shift and it was optional to install and in this release (SteamPipe Release at the time that this review was written) you can just tick a check box in your graphics section on your options menu to enable and disable it and the HD Model Pack is now available for Half-Life and Opposing Force without needing to buy Blue Shift and now they fixed the HUD Color Bug which was in the previous Steam version of this game.

Based upon the time on my playthrough videos, Half-Life is about 10 to 12 hours to playthrough.

Based upon the time on my playthrough videos, Opposing Force is about 6 to 8 hours to playthrough.

Based upon the time on my playthrough videos, Blue Shift is about 4 to 6 hours to playthrough.

Valve and Gearbox did a excellent job making this game.

Back in the day when this game was first released, it would have not have been worth the price unless you did not have Opposing Force which was also included with the WON (Pre-Steam) Release of this game but since it is cheap on Steam then i recommend this game but i would rather recommend just buying the Half-Life 1 Anthology Pack on steam itself or buying a used copy of the WON Release of Half-Life for cheap and attempt to register it on Steam by activating the CD Key and hope that it works rather than buying this game standalone.

I purchased the miniature console with several games, and less than a year later I sold it all off. The problem with the Vita to me became apparent. Sony has created this incredible hardware (albeit expensive at the time $250+) and for more than 12 months never treated it like it deserved. The design was beautiful, the OLED screen really made games and HD videos look crisp and clear, and unlike it's predecessor (the PSP) it had REAL miniature analog sticks (something that had been long since criticized on the PSP). Adding the rear touchpad gave it another cool new feature that could be used for anything the studios dreamed up, this concept was also implemented on the PlayStation 4 controller.

The PS Vita's interface is almost identical to the PlayStation 3. Unlike the PSP, which used now obsolete 'UMDs' (Universal Media Disc), the Vita uses little game cards instead. Now that the PS4 has been released one of the things Sony has started to do right, has been to implement the use of the Vita with the PlayStation 4 in cross play and remote play situations. What this means is that I could be playing a game on my Vita in one room while my PlayStation 4 is running in another.

Let's be honest, no one ever really expects a movie-based game to deliver.  Ghostbusters did.  Well, for the most part.  The graphics are amazing, the voice-acting is top notch; especially with the old cast resuming their roles.  The plot, although not anything that will blow your doors off, certainly had that hint at the once great films, uncluding some rather enjoyable references to the other films and some easter eggs hidden throughout.  The challenge was just enough to keep me playing although I did have some gripes.  All in all, this game delivered to my less-than-enthralled expectations.

This all being said.  This game can and probably will be beaten in one afternoon.  Worse case, a couple days of playing.  Some folks may not see this as a problem, but as someone who wants some substance from my games, this was a major eyesore.  Problem two, near as I could tell, there is no map.  Early in the game this isn't a huge deal, but when you are running around some of the later stages, it gets to be downright frustrating.  The controls, while excellent all in all, tend to be rather unforgiving in close quarters.  Frequently, I was finding myself stuck on a wall or worse still, IN walls, trying to navigate around to find my way through the maze that was the stage.

This game was a load of fun and worth the time and money I spent to RENT it.  Had I forked over full price for it I would have been much harsher on this game.  This is a renter for sure, but no matter how much I loved the Ghostbusters, I couldn't justify paying full price for it.  No matter how fun it was to trap ghosts, there just isn't enough to keep me entertained longer than a day or two.  Even as I tried to play through again to find all the hidden items and get all my scans, I got bored again.

Second con, it takes a lot of time to play the game and to actually fall in love and then get married a lot of time, I'm totally not kidding.

I created a character, which took like 30 minutes, then it took me 3 more hours to make the house like I wanted. Then it took like an hour to figure out cheats and how to play better. Then My character meets somebody, falls in love, then it turns out that that character has a dream goal of breaking as much hearts as he can. So I had to figure out a way to make him fall head over heels with me or figure a cheat to control him and change his goal in life *which I did lol*.

Suzuki Alstare has a few mayor flaws.  The physics  in the game is one of them.  There is a lack of feel of going fast.  Another flaw in the physics is falling.

Both games cast a young heroine discovering herself as her quest progresses through places going from whimsical to eerie, and both games got outstanding reviews from critics all over the adventure gaming world.
On some accounts, Syberia is better that The Longest Journey. Graphically, for example. The premises are much more typical and interesting in Syberia. You can definitely feel Benoit Sokal's touch. It looks like great research has been conducted to create the different locations. The result feels very homogeneous, something I think The Longest Journey was lacking to some extent.
Another thing Syberia is really good at is stretching reality to great lengths, without ever totally breaking into fantasy or science fiction. The fact that (nearly) everything in that game is so close to how reality is, or could be, adds a great deal of credibility to the story, and the game itself. Mostly everything is exaggerated to some point, as to make the story and decor interesting, but it never goes too far, thus not distracting the player with inconsistencies.
Now for the bad (or not as good) parts.
The dialogs and voices are not nearly as good as in The Longest Journey. Voices are OK, but compared to the quality of the graphics, OK just does not cut it. Nothing is so bad it makes you cringe, but it just feels that it could have been done so much better. Dialogs sometimes sound canned, but I have to admit that it's a pitfall that is really hard to avoid when making an adventure game. I only know a handful of games that managed to avoid it (The Longest Journey being one of them).
The story is compelling, but it will leave you with a feeling of something lacking. Obviously the it is a set-up for a sequel. Of course the same trick has been used in many games, but does it make it OK? I just wish the end brought a better feeling of closure. When I play a game, I usually become attached to the main characters, and it always feels weird to have the story hanging when the game ends.
Conclusion: If you have to pick only one game between The Longest Journey and Syberia, it's a tough call, but go for The Longest Journey. But you should definitely try to play both those games, as both of them bring something very interesting to the world of adventure games. You will not be disappointed by either one.",Syberia / The Longest Journey,1055289600,6,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

There are also no real mini games that can be played freely. Not exactly what I have in mind when I think of all the original FF7 side quests and mini games. The worst part is there are no chocobos or moogles!!! At least none that are interactable with your character. All in all it is a great game that can get very addictive and is definitely worth buying; but it lacks the real FF feel that I was hoping for.","Great addition to FF series, but still lacks something...",1215820800,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

My first exposure to this tale was on Game Cube, not the Wii as most people may have seen it. The previous game, Wind Waker, was preceeded by a demo disc showcasing four Zelda games (the first game on NES, the second game on NES, and the two N64 games) as well as a triumphant WW demo.

WW may be a bit longwinded with its sailing motif, and the wolf levels in early on in TP are somewhat a hassle in that you have to collect these bugs that only wolf Link can see. There's also these large guardian monsters who will trap you in a small enclosure once in awhile where you must defeat them all at once or else they'll get back up off the floor and attack.

The Dark World concept is borrowed from the third Zelda game (A Link to the Past for SNES) and being a wolf is so much more enjoyable than being human. But its drawback is you're not allowed to use your sword or other weapons Link collects.

Midna is a breakout character of the ages and she is fully voiced albeit in some strange language of her own. Game Cube was a golden age for Nintendo with the mature themes of chivalry, responcibility, and heroism displayed by this version of Link.  Also, as a side-note three great Resident Evil games from Capcom originated on the system so for a time Nintendo's GC was not entirely the ""kiddie  console"" any more then and now.

4.0,False,"06 21, 2003",A2JU4FUSW1PBEC,B00006LEMX,Michael P.,"I remember playing the very first shinobi in arcades way back in the 80's.  Seeing Shinobi return with modern-day gaming technology was a big surprise.
This game is your typical run of the mill action hack 'n slash game.  Its not really boring...its alot of fun actually.  Most hack 'n slash games get boring rather quickly but Shinobi manages to maintain exciting gameplay throughout most of the game.  The soundtrack is sort of Japanese-techno with a quick beat.  It sounds somewhat inspired by Japanese Animation.  The graphics are pretty decent (though noticeably full of PS2 'Jaggies') and the flowing sash that trails behind your character is very, very cool.
Unfortunately I have noticed that many people complain about the difficulty.  Frankly I must agree.  The game can be extremely frustrating at times.  I found myself spending more time turning it off and walking away from it than sitting through and playing it.  When you die in the game you must restart from the beginning of the level, no matter how much progress you made, which is, needless to say, very frustrating.  The game is a good challenge but it definitely would've benefit from mid-level save checkpoints.
'Tate' kills are a nice little reward for quick multi-kills.  They occur when you killed a group of 4 or more enemies in quick succession.  When you kill all of them, you are treated to a brief in-game cutscene with Shinobi striking a pose, sometimes uttering a line, and then watching your enemies fall to bloody pieces around you (again, looking as if inspired by Japanese Animation.)  These kills help to fuel your power and will increase the power of your weapon.  However, in later levels Tate kills will become very necessary for you to survive, since your sword begins to consume your life.  If you go more than 1 minute without killing an enemy, you will die.  this becomes very frustrating, since it leaves no time for you to look for secrets.  Tate kills also become nearly impossible in later levels since the enemies become stronger.  Some cannot even be killed...many enemies requires lots of dashing and jumping to even do damage to their invincible blocking.  These incredibly annoying enemies often take so long to beat that the other enemies die before the Tate can be completed.
Fighting enemies can sometimes become frustrating.  The targeting system is pretty strange...instead of targeting the nearest enemy, it will target the enemy that is often farthest from you or is most directly in your line of view, often resulting in the closer enemies around you getting in some cheap hits.  Sometimes in the middle of a combo, Shinobi will freeze in a pose, allowing other enemies to get a good 2 or 3 hits on you.  Otherwise, the fighting just takes a little bit of skill and some getting used to, but you will enjoy it.
The commercial was right: Shinobi's back.  And in a big way.  This is definitely a good game but you must have a high threshold of patience.  This game can become very frustrating, resulting in cheap deaths(especially in levels that are just packed with pitfalls) and unbeleivably difficult boss fights lead to many fights being done and over and over.  Alot of the levels are very bland and very repetetive as well.  But the game has a good story, told through some pretty good cinematics.  The American voices aren't that bad either.  Usually translated voices are pretty awful, but Shinobi has some decent talent (although the rogue ninja woman has an irritating 'school-girl' type of voice).
If you were a fan of Shinobi in the past, or are looking for a fast-paced action game with a decent story, pick it up.  However if you are a casual gamer that isn't looking for much of a challenge, stay away.  The difficulty of the game will probably get to you rather quickly.",Fun but difficult action game,1056153600,14,,

New characters and a few new gameplay options helped to buoy the setup, but after the prior volume, it seemed to have run out of steam. Enter Miles Edgeworth, with a rather impressive revamp.

Graphics and gameplay have rather improved, and the characters are crisper and better detailed. Also, a more interactive setup, including a large environment 2d character motion, has been added, rather than having to do a screen by screen analysis, allowing for more depth and a better feel to the story.

In place of the rather tedious courtroom tennis match that made up the majority of the AA games, the arguments are much shorter and separated, though the climax encounter tends to drag out a tad longer than necessary. Also included are logical jumps, which edgeworth uses multiple evidence pieces to piece together story bits to advance the plot, rather than relying on finding that last piece of evidence or wandering around looking for the new character interaction.

Audio still is a let down, in that theres little to no voice apart from the few cries of ""objection"" and ""hold it,"" the mainstays of the series. I'm still puzzled that more can't be included, if only a few crucial snippets from the main characters.

To balance it out with positive factors, Sandblast has done a decent job of taking over from Pandemic Games in keeping up the sharp wit and humorous writing that makes this game just as enjoyable script wise. Weaponry is still neat, and it is good to see the voice actors J. Grant Albrecht and Richard Horvitz reprising their roles as Cryptosporidium and Orthopox from the earlier games.

And while I'm certain many people have played this game, it almost makes me want to kick myself in the head for not knowing this game existed.

Enter- Rise to Honor for the PS2.

What a game!
This game gives you control over Martial Artist Jet Li who's aptly named Kit Yun in ROH. This game is totally reminiscent of John Woo's Stranglehold for the 360; except it features hand-to-hand combat, gunplay and some nifty quick time events.
The first thing I noticed about the game would be the life-like appearance of Jet Li. In fact, he looks exactly like himself only in 3D.

Graphically speaking, this game supports progressive scanning, but the very first level looked really ""dusty"", while every other level looked just fine. The graphics are pretty smooth and ""jaggies"" aren't as noticeable here as is the case with many PS2 games. The backgrounds weren't particularly imaginative; ranging from back alleys to rooftops or bars. However, the fact that most of the backgrounds are interactive or destructible was a plus in my book. I really liked the slow-motion camera cuts when you pull off a combo or perhaps toss a chair in an enemy's face. The close ups are smooth and look fantastic. While playing, I'd have to say that I haven't encountered any framerate issues or slowdown.
But the one part this game was lacking in at times would be the sound. I loved the voice acting (which actually features Jet Li's voice) and tossing someone into a window sounds awesome, but the sound effects used for punching and kicking seemed weak, lacking dynamics altogether. Still, for the most part, the sound in this game is pretty good. Music is kept to a minimal which is another problem being that at times some cutscenes sounded a little too quiet for comfort.
With that said, this doesn't say anything against the gameplay.

Rise to Honor is a beat em up, with some on-rails platforming elements and quick time events that progresses the in-game story in the tradition of a 70's kung fu movie; but with some modern twists thrown in. Namely, some sections in which you'll use a gun.
The combat is handled by an innovative but satisfying analog control which replaces face buttons. In fact, you won't be using the face buttons at all. Instead, you're given a block button that's mapped to R1, adrenaline which is mapped to L1 and the right analog stick takes care of all the hand to hand fighting while R2 is simply used for shooting. The control scheme may not be ideal for hack and slash/platforming enthusiasts, but it feels quite comfortable considering all the combinations you're able to pull off with such a simplistic control scheme.
Rise to Honor also tosses in ""interactivity"" which is along the lines of being able to grab weapons such as chairs, garbage cans, lobsters amongst other background goodies and use them against enemies. This comes in handy considering Rise of Honor tosses the usual odds of 6 on 1 at you. The problem with this is while the enemies do attack you, there are times they'll simply stand and wait to be attacked, while other times enemies will pull off flashy kicks or martial arts katas that rival your in-game character's moves.
Still, I can't deny the fact that this game is quite a charming offering, especially for fans of martial arts movies. It seems the gaming world offers so little in this genre and unfortunately, Rise to Honor will stand as a unique example of innovative gaming though perhaps the last of it's kind.

There are plenty of unlockables ranging from concept art to ""the making of"" and so on.
Rise to Honor is definitely worth the buy for any PS2 fan or perhaps someone who wasn't familiar with the PS2 last gen would definitely find this game ideal.

4.0,True,"03 21, 2008",A3WIOO9L0DNGZ,B000SSPH3E,Kevin Major,"Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions is a remake of the original Final Fantasy Tactics for the PS1.  The original was perhaps the most popular turn-based tactical RPG ever made, and this newest version remains true to the original.

Not much, in terms of plot, has changed in the remake.  The new translation is far better than the often laughable Engrish of the original, and some names have been changed to make the game fit better into the more fleshed out Ivalice of Final Fantasy XII.  This doesn't change the story, but makes it easier to understand and far more enjoyable to witness.

Graphically, the game is a bit of a mixed bag.  The original PS1 graphics remain, and they haven't aged very well.  Characters and monsters are depicted by the now familiar Square-Enix superdeformed sprites.  The maps are pseudo-3D.  They can be rotated so the player can see around obstacles, but they're not exactly stunning to behold.  On the flipside, the new cutscenes are absolutely gorgeous.  They're fully animated, and very fluid, but retain an almost parchment-like quality to them.  The style mimics the official art very closely, and helps to bridge the gap between the art and the sprites.

The audio, again, is a mixed bag.  Some of the music is beautiful, but there are a few annoying tunes thrown in, which quickly becomes a problem as the track repeats itself for the nth time while you're grinding for experience and job points.  The sound effects are pretty standard.  The voice acting, on the other hand, is superb.  It's a shame that its limited to just the cutscenes.

The gameplay is familiar to those experienced with the genre.  Battles are fought on a square map.  Obstacles - buildings, trees, lava...it all depends on where the battle is taking place - and monsters litter these battlegrounds.  You control a squad of up to 5 characters.  Each combatant - both the characters you control and the enemy NPCs - gets a turn, which allows them to move and/or perform an action.  Most battles simply consist of defeating all enemies on the map or one particular enemy without getting the main character killed in the process.

The tactical side of the game largely comes from which jobs your characters have mastered.  Jobs are essentially character classes.  You have the standards: warrior, healer, wizard, etc.  There are other, more esoteric jobs, like mathematician and dancer.  Every defeated enemy gives that character job points, which allows you to purchase an ability from a job, which grants that character permanent access to that ability.  So, you can have a warrior capable of casting offensive magic if you purchase the right abilities.  Access to jobs is predicated on which jobs that character already has access to, and what levels they have obtained with those jobs.  The more useful or powerful the job you want to give your character, the more levels in pre-existing jobs they need.  So, expect lots of grinding for both experience and job points, especially early on in the game.

The last aspect of the gameplay I must mention is the steep learning curve.  This game is not new player friendly.  You'll die A LOT in this game, especially in the early stages.  What's worse is that you'll die from creatures that are typically cannon fodder in other Square-Enix games.  Trust me when I say that you'll learn to fear Chocobos.  The game becomes much easier if you grind for abilities early on, but the beginning portion is hellish, especially during a first playthrough.

All in all, The War of the Lions is a great remake.  It's difficult, and parts of it haven't aged well, but it's definitely more than the sum of its parts.

When I stop and think about the original arcade game, it just blows my mind. Double Dragon and Bad Dudes were decent looking arcades, but Final Fight took it to the next level. The beautifully rendered Metro City (which has NYC's landmarks) is a perfect backdrop for this game. The colors are bright, the music is decent, and the action is non-stop. The three greatest elements of the game are the Capcom visual presentation, the NYC-style setting, and most importantly the representation of varied fighting styles. Haggar is the big American wrestler, Cody is the American kickboxer style fighter, and Guy is the Eastern-style martial artist. The look and attire appropriately matches the character's fighting style. It's absolutely brilliant.

The SNES port I just received has the obvious flaws of missing the industrial stage, no 2-player, no blood, replacing female (and/or transsexual) sprites Roxy and Poison with Sid and Billy, and worst of all...NO GUY. The lack of a stage sucks, and the blood was a really neat touch in the arcade version. I can get over Roxy and Poison being replaced, but it's a shame since Roxy and Poison are very interesting looking...they look like a punky cross between Debbie Gibson and Cindy Lauper, and I find them visually interesting. It's a shame they got cut, and the online controversy will continue to rage over whether or not Poison was a female or shemale.

BUT NO GUY. Out of the three unique looking characters, the most eastern-looking character in a karate outfit was cut. This is completely unacceptable, because so much of the appeal of the game is wrapped up in the idea of blending street fighting and karate to punish punks in NYC. Without Guy, it might as well be Axel Blaze and Max Thunder. Imagine if one of the Street Fighter II games didn't have Ryu and it's the same thing. The SNES Guy Edition cartridge is rare and too expensive, and still has all the same problems plus NO CODY. It's a lose-lose situation.

I'm tempted to think that Capcom thought that Axel Blaze was copying Cody's look (jeans, white shirt, Converse All-Stars), so Cody was scrapped from Final Fight 2 and 3. I know most gamers consider 2 to be the best, but I can't get over how badly the series was messed up because of the radically different cast. Cody and Guy were left out of Final Fight 2 and replaced with Maki (a Chun-Li clone) and a ninja named Carlos. Carlos is the most un-ninja name I've ever heard, and he really should have been given a cowl or something to complete the look. I am impressed by the game taking place in major cities all over the world, but why Cody and Guy were shafted is a mystery. Final Fight 3, like Streets of Rage 3, is the tired afterthought of the series with a few new additions, but the curtain call as 16-bit beat 'em ups died so tournament fighting games (like Street Fighter 2) could live. In Final Fight 3, at least they finally added Guy. Lucia, the female character, is my personal favorite hottest 16 bit babe. But then there's a nobody named Dean. Who the hell is Dean? WHERE IS CODY????

In summation, Final Fight was one of the greatest beat 'em  arcades, second only to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but never got it right on the Super Nintendo. From a doomed port of the first game to an unrectified Blockbuster exclusive to two sequels that never got it right. It's almost no wonder why Streets of Rage 2 is considered the best entry between the two series.

All of the problems that annoyed players with the first SVR are gone. The horrible voice acting is the first major improvement. Wrestlers no longer sound like they reading lines from a script. Their is even a hint of an echo when wrestlers are giving a speech in the ring. JR's voice is the only one that is not very good.

Major improvement number two is the graphics. OMG do the graphics look awesome. These graphics make SVR05 look like playstation 1 graphics. And keep in mind that game was only made a year ago.

The final major improvement is the game play itself. In SVR05 once you got the first hit on your opponent it was smooth sailing from there. All you had to do was keep hitting your opponent whenever he got up and keep using moves that do a lot of damage. On SVR06 this has been changed with the stamina system. It basically prevents one player from dominating a match by using high damage moves over and over again and also allows for one last desperation move by the guy who is getting a beat down. This leads to a very realistic and exciting match. Especially when you get to the point where both players are worn out. Other new features include playing possum, strong Irish whips, and the new GM mode.

The GM mode is great for any sports fan that likes a good management game. You are tasked with drafting players, trading, negotiating salaries and determining who fights in what kind of match. You can watch or play these matches.

This game is not perfect though. SVR06 does have its short comings. One is the targeting itself. You often find yourself accidently knocking out the ref even though you are targeting the player. While die hard WWE fans will tell me that its how matches are fought. I would disagree, because I've watch a million wrestling matches on TV and I never saw a wrestler accidently knock down the ref 5 times in a match before. Sometimes its difficult to quickly target different players  making handicap and royal rumble matches a headache. Finally the graphics maybe sweet but they are not 100% perfect. Perform a rear choke hold or any kind of submission and you see your characters hand going through your opponents neck. Or his foot going through your submission hold. It looks like your hand or foot is IN (not on..IN) your opponent. Other PS2 games don't have these graphic errors....SVR 06 does.",One of PS2's best,1135900800,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},
4.0,True,"01 19, 2017",A18C19UTTAQEOD,B01GKF7T9S,SpaceDesigner,"I am 16% into this game after hours and hours of play. San Francisco is big, beautiful, and feels very alive. I passed on the first Watchdogs, but after reading a few reviews I was really curious. The characters are likeable, I dig the Deadsec aesthetics, the story is good enough, and the tools & skills available create a myriad of options when it comes to tactics. I LOVE the RC and the drone - save up and buy the drone ASAP! Watchdogs 2 offers non lethal options for dispatching enemies which is refreshing after playing lots of GTA V. The game runs well enough on the PS4 but I've noticed some frame juttering and what looks like screen tearing on occasion when roaming around the huge populated environment. Watchdogs 2 is ""enhanced"" for the PS4 Pro and I'm guessing this might be the new normal - you'll need a PS4 Pro to get the best experience on massive open world games like this (or buy the PC version and have top tier hardware).

I do have some gripes/suggestions (if anyone from UBI happens to cruise amazon reviews):
- The driving in 3rd person feels a bit off. Not terrible, but not always good. Driving in the GTA series feels natural or just more real. Here it feels like an arcade game and the camera is to slow to adjust around sharp turns. I've found driving in 1st person is a much better experience.
- Enemy AI is aggressive and predictable. When you get discovered they swarm on Marcus immediately, but if you evade and hide they give up and go back to patrolling. I wish it was more in the middle - smarter enemies with less emphasis on the dog pile/swarm tactics.
- The tone of the main Deadsec crew and Marcus is pretty upbeat and even optimistic. That tone contrasts with the more violent options in the game. I enjoy tearing things up in GTA. That's due to GTA's characters being genuinely bad dudes and the world they inhabit being a cynical reflection of our reality. I'd love to have seen more consequence applied to the choices made in Watchdogs 2 - like in the Dishonored franchise. If you take a violent path the city reacts and becomes more chaotic with a darker conclusion. If you favor stealth and non lethal engagement the world is less violent and the  resolution is more hopeful. Guns in this game are acquired via 3D printing. Maybe give some choice here between lethal and non-lethal. Like a sniper rifle that shoots tranq darts, a shotgun that shoots bean bags, or even something wacky like a net or foam cannon. The characters are young hackers fighting for the people. Once you give them guns and they start killing people that makes them domestic terrorists waging an insurgency. I'm pretty sure that would affect Deadsec's follower numbers and public perception.
- The PS4 controller has a touchpad. I can't believe this wasn't put to better use. Every time I use Marcus's phone I think about how natural it would have been to use the touchpad to interact with his smartphone. Feels like a missed opportunity.

Anyways I'm really enjoying my time in Watchdogs 2's San Fran. Exploring, hacking, and playing with those wonderful toys!","Big, Beautiful, and Different",1484784000,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

4.0,True,"10 28, 2015",AY76Q07AI4MBW,B013X9HA7K,Robert Wallace,"First, let me say that I am a huge Zelda fan, and I have played through every single title at least once.  As far as Triforce Heroes goes, I played through the entire quest single-player my first time through, as I wanted to figure out all the puzzles on my own.  The good news is that, unlike both ""Four Swords"" titles, there actually IS some puzzle solving in this game.  Never enough for one to need a walkthrough, but enough to make you occasionally stop and think in order to get past a particular area.

After playing through the first 6 (out of 32) levels, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.  It seemed tedious and simple.  But by the time I got to the fire-themed levels (levels 9-12), I was having fun with this game.  It got even better from there.

While controlling all three of the characters individually might sound tedious (and to be fair: it certainly is at times), it's made simpler via the totem mechanic the game is based around.  There are some timing-based puzzles that may be difficult to pull off one-player, but none of them are impossible.  An entire boss is made frustratingly difficult by having to switch from character to character, but I still managed it on my first try.

The biggest problem with Triforce Heroes is that it is left feeling like two-thirds of a game.  I suspect we'll get the final third of the game (or at least another 8 levels) in the form of paid DLC.  Unfortunate, given that this title was released at full price.

None of the levels feel particularly replayable -- once you've solved a puzzle there's little fun to be had by going back.  I know this because I replayed every level on their various challenge modes, except for the time-limit based ones, which were a bit too difficult for me to complete one-player (my guess is they're best played in local co-op mode).

THE BOTTOM LINE: Will you enjoy single player mode? It depends what you like about Zelda games.  If you primarily like logic-based puzzle solving, boss fights, and can handle a slow pace, then I'd say the answer is yes.  If you primarily like exploration, collecting, and battling ... or if you *can't* handle a slow pace, then I'd say no.

A WORD ON MULTIPLAYER: I prefer the arena battles to the cooperative play.  Perhaps it's because I played it single-player first, and the element of ""discovery"" was gone by the time I started playing with others.  Alas, I was not able to do local play, which I expect would be the optimal way to play this game.

I hope this was helpful to those single players who want to know if it's worth a go.  All in all, I'd say this is one of the weaker Zelda titles, but thanks to the puzzle-solving, it's a much better single-player experience than either of the ""Four Swords"" games, which were all about collecting rupees, fighting enemies, and teaming up to push the occasional block.  That said, I had far more fun with the multiplayer in those games, and they were more forgiving of less skilled players.  (In this title, one bad player can ruin the experience for everyone.)",Review for Single-Players,1445990400,4,,

4.0,True,"09 19, 2015",A114TMHW9GRMPB,B00D6NMYE8,DJ_King_SD,"Being a huge fan of Lego video games, I was looking for something different to play with my 8-year old daughter. She suggested Skylanders which many of her friends play, so I looked it up. Being new to this series, I didn't know much about them but I decided on SWAP Force due to large variety of characters and versatility in gameplay.

Overall, I was impressed with this starter pack. For the money, it's really a great value in terms of entertainment. The production value of the game itself is high, with solid voice work and good humor. The quality of the figures is also impressive. It's clear that the starter pack was priced to give you a taste, which brings me to the single biggest issue I have with this game...un-anticipated cost.

In order to fully access all the content in the game, you must purchase additional figures, which I was aware of, but I did not plan ahead (ok that's my fault). A few hours into the game, I realized that you need to purchase at least 8 additional figures in order to have all the abilities and categories covered, most of which are mandatory to access certain minigames or levels within the game. Most of the figures cost between $15 and $20 each, some are almost impossible to find due to rarity (for one very rare character, you can find it on eBay for $30+). So doing the math, you will need to spend at least $120 to fully access all the content. If you are ok with this, then it's no big deal. For me, by the time I realized this, I was about half way through the game and it did not make sense for me to (1) purchase all the figures and (2) go back and replay levels I had already completed in order to find the previously locked content.

Clearly this business model is working well for the producers, and kudos to them for coming up with this. Looking back, it would have been a better overall experience (for my daughter and I) if I had purchased all the characters up front and not have to worry about not getting access to something while playing. This is the approach I will likely take in future series.

All in all, a great game which I recommend highly for parents with kids.","Great game, just be mindful of the somewhat hidden cost",1442620800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,False,"05 27, 2016",A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B01B298Q0S,Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"I'm gonna say it right now - I hopped right onboard this TMNT game on account of Platinum Games having developed it. However, despite that, this new Ninja Turtles game does carry the Activision logo, and speaking from experience with their non-Call of Duty games, this could either be a pleasant surprise (aka Platinum's name reigning supreme) or an absolute crapfest (aka Activision meddling Platinum out of a good game as they usually do with devs). Thankfully, this game is actually the former.

So Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan is Activision's fourth game for the franchise, but the first one to be notable for actually trying to make an effort. While the main menus give off a low-budget feel, that matter becomes rectified by the well-presented cutscenes, which demonstrate the game's comic book styled graphics and adequate voice acting and animation. The plot is simple enough; Shredder and Krang team up to try and use outer space to invade the city and wipe it out, and of course it's up to the heroes in a half-shell, with April's guidance, to stop them. That aspect tends to go by the numbers, but it does get presented well enough, and it has its chuckleworthy moments (Well...as well as a couple cringey ones).

As can be expected from a game by Platinum, action-packed beat 'em up gameplay is key to Mutants in Manhattan's formula. The levels kinda sorta give off an open-world vibe, as places like Manhattan itself can be explored freely. However, the game really wants the player to focus on the missions. The entire adventure is mission-based, which range from killing an amount of enemies to preventing a tangible weapon from being used by them. The missions are kept at a solid pace for the most part, but there are some that I just wish were nullified or not in the game altogether; case in point is that of which the player has to disarm bombs. Don't worry, it's not like that water level in the NES TMNT game. But this game instead has you hold down the B button to disarm a bomb (Granted, enemies may try and fight the player to pose a challenge for this, but.....C'mon), which is a pace-breaker in comparison to anything else. Only a couple of the game's nine lengthy levels feature these missions, but again, I feel like they could've easily been something better.

On a slightly different note, the T Glass feature (which helps you see where your mission objective is located) seems nice and all, but I feel like it'd be cool if there was also a standard map radar in case I don't want to have to keep switching between regular graphics and the super-technical view.

When the action goes down, however, it goes DOWN. Sure, the game is oddly in 30 frames per second instead of the usual 60 that Platinum Games embrace(s), but boy does it feel like a mashup of oldschool arcade beat 'em ups and modern-day variety! Considering how many post-Konami TMNT games have been monotonous with the enemy variety, I was surprised to see that this game actually does HAVE a variety of baddies to kill, complete with their own ways of attacking. And the Turtles have a few options themselves - Each Turtle has different special moves he can pull off by holding the L Trigger and pressing a face button (and you can switch between Turtles via L Trigger and D-Pad) as well as attack combos executed by pressing X and/or Y buttons. While there are enemies that go down fairly quickly and reasonably through a combo or two, don't be shocked when the game decides to turn you into turtle soup.

This is actually a challenging game. It's not brutal by any means, but it does a decent job of keeping the player on his/her toes. The boss battles are probably what impressed me the most. They feel like bosses from an arcade game by Konami, brought into 3D. Their patterns are tricky and varied, but when you beat the crap out of them you feel like you're the MAN (or woman, depending)! Too bad you can't celebrate the victory with anyone unless you play online.

Alright, time to address some more negatives...
Easily the biggest problem with this game is the inability to play with friends on the same couch. No local multiplayer, online only, Final Desti-Wait, wrong game. But yeah, even though I don't mind playing single-player, I still find it dumbfounding that they took the time to create online servers for this game, yet for some reason the only way you're playing this locally is by yourself. Which is absolutely BS because this seems like it would've been an awesome time to spend with local friends! All four Turtles are in this adventure fighting TOGETHER after all. It all just seems like a big missed opportunity on Platinum's/Activision's part.

There's also all this talk about MiM's length, which is reported to be able to be beaten in three and a half hours or under. Personally, my first and only playthrough so far lasted 5 hours and 18 minutes, which is fair enough I suppose, right? I dunno, I'm not really the kind of guy that minds when a game is short. After all, I paid well over fifty bucks for a TMNT Turtles in Time cartridge, and that game can be played through in under an hour.

One thing that comes to mind for me is the sound design. Now, I am fond of the voice acting performances for this game, but when the Turtles end up dying, they can become the most annoying things at the moment. There is banter between them in various areas, but their deaths are when it's most blatant that there are voice clips that have a tendency to repeat, and it can be especially grating during boss battles when trying hard to survive and keep battling. At least there's an option to lower/mute the voice volume, but the attack sound effects seem like they need the voices present to complement the atmosphere. On another note, the music, while actually kind of sporting a catchy beat on certain levels, is certainly no TMNT arcade soundtrack.

Basically, what TMNT: Mutants in Manhattan is is a game not without flaws, but when you're in for the core adventure, it can actually be a lot of fun. I had a very good time playing through this game from start to finish, and if you're looking for a solid Turtles game (but aren't seeing multiplayer as a necessity) I say give this one a go. Those interested but not willing to spend $50 on a game like this can wait for the inevitable price drop that pretty much every Activision game goes through over the course of the initial or second year after release.

4.0,True,"09 28, 2015",A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B00DWXV1CI,Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"Quick disclaimer: I paid $2 for my used copy. Easily the only deal I ever found good enough for this game.

For those of you that have been living under a rock or something, Angry Birds is a little game that Rovio released on mobile devices for $0.99 back when smartphone gaming began to take off. Because of that, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon and spawned numerous more games. I'd be fine with that, but then Activision came along and got an idea: ""Let's make easy cash on this trend by releasing overpriced $40 ($20 for handheld, but that's still $19 more than the original price) versions of some Angry Birds games for store shelves so little kids can spot them and bug their clueless parents until they fall into the scam!""

There's a reason why I didn't buy this Nintendo 3DS edition of Angry Birds Star Wars when it came out; supporting full retail priced Angry Birds is like supporting Destiny: The Taken King.

Anyway, Angry Birds Star Wars continues the simplistic physics-based mechanics that the series has been known for since its debut in 2009. You use your eyeballs to scan the level layout, slingshot some birds across, and hope that they crush the opposing green pigs, whether by direct means or toppling over wood or stone structures. The birds are color-coded, as what unique ability they can use (especially in the case of Star Wars) depends on the color of the bird. For example, red birds can swing the lightsaber, and yellow birds shoot with Han Solo's signature blaster.

The level designs proudly emphasize on its surroundings, as you could try and knock out the pigs right then and there, but there are also ways you could strategically launch birds in areas that would cause catastrophic results against the pigs. There are mirrors that can reflect the blaster lasers, TNT boxes to blow up, and the game even takes a few cues from Angry Birds Space by including some gravity-based layouts. With well over 200 of these levels, plus 20 more levels that are apparently exclusive to this version of the game (not that it would justify the purchase alone), there's plenty of bird-slinging action to go around. It's madly addicting to fire off a bird or few, and it's always satisfying to watch the layouts get destroyed by your antics. Star Wars makes things even more interesting thanks to its theme and unique Jedi powers the birds carry. It's somewhat odd that this game runs in 30fps instead of 60 (I mean, really? It's freaking Angry Birds!), but it's easy to get used to, and is by no means a dealbreaker.

Angry Birds Star Wars is indeed recommended, but of course, only if you buy it for cheap. Now that copies can be spotted for as low as $4 (if not lower, considering how much I paid for mine), I think it's okay to buy into it if you have a few bucks to spare and/or aren't as fond of doing this stuff on mobile phones as you would on a Nintendo handheld. It's nowhere as criminal as the initial price, that's for sure.

As for the business practices to begin with, they certainly get a -1/5.","Rovio, use the Force",1443398400,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,False,"01 2, 2010",ASPJAVXNRF1EU,B002NILFB0,Alain Gomez,"I hated The Sims 3 when I first played it.  I was bitterly disappointed that the game was not a more perfected continuation of what Sims 2 had to offer.  I actually switched back to playing Sims 2 for quite some time before I finally decided to reinstall Sims 3 and give it another shot.

In order to enjoy Sims 3, I had to really readjust my thinking and gaming style.  In Sims 2, I loved the whole ""linage"" aspect of the game.  95% of my playing time was devoted to creating multi-generational families.  You can't really do that so much with Sims 3.  In many ways, it's not unlike the original Sims in that it really focuses on the story of ONE family rather than an entire neighborhood.

World Adventures furthers this emphasis.  They weren't kidding when they say ""adventures.""  It's not a vacation, it's not leisure time, it's stay-on-a-strict-schedule-so-you-can-get-everything-done adventures.  The different travel locations are really designed for one sim to explore rather than a whole family.

With this expansion, I don't even bother creating families anymore.  I just play with my one bachelor sim.  Between nectar making, sim-fu, gardening and playing his guitar, I find that I have way more fun trying to max out all of his skills and getting higher visa levels than creating a nuclear family.  I mean, what's the point of having kids if it will be such a drag trying to switch households once they grow up and move out?

On a more technical note, this expansion is slightly buggy even with all of the ""patch"" fixes.  I haven't experienced any crashes as of yet but I have noticed minor things like lifetime rewards not working properly (i.e. I chose ""pay no bills ever"" and occasionally I am still asked to pay bills).  It also does take a considerable amount of computer power to operate.  So be warned if you were operating the base game on bare minimum specs; this expansion might do you in.

If you enjoyed or were even luke-warm about Sims 3, I would recommend this expansion.  Unlike some, I was not crazy about the base game (see my review).  But I have to say that this expansion added to my overall enjoyment of the game.","For better or for worse, it stays true to Sims 3 play",1262390400,13,{'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'},

While Trinity: SoZO is not a fantastic RPG, it isn't a bad one either.  With well over 40 hours of gameplay here, and a solid storyline Trinity: SoZO will be a game that you simply can't put down until the final credits roll.

GAMEPLAY
Trinity: SoZO feels a bit like Dynasty Warriors with a more solid RPG element to it.  You will have a party of 3 and can switch between characters at whim.  Each character has skills you map to the controller (12 skills, can map a total of only 6).  For much of the early part of the game (first 6-10 hours) you can expect to partake in tons of quests and arena fights to boost your skill level.  Once you get past the initial early grind the game begins to open up and allow a much more free roam feel in terms of what you can do.  ""Quests"" are randomly handed out be it from the Adventures Guild or by partaking in conversations in various taverns or shops.  When you aren't in towns you will be out in the world in a large variety of areas fighting mobs.  The game plays like a bit like a hack and slash then; plowing through lots of trash mobs with the occasional tough mob or even a boss grade mob.  Just when you think things might be getting far to repetitive, the game will throw in some new features (such as chain combos).  Overall the gameplay is quite a lot of fun and provides a non-stop flow of action but can get a little repetitive due to quests often taking you back to the same areas

GRAPHICS
The graphics are okay. They aren't mind blowing but they feel early PS3 in quality(720p).  The part that hurts the game graphically is this annoying ""filter"" that is put over the game. You can not turn this filter off.  ""During gameplay"" the filter is actually rather nice. It gives the game this nice PS3 water-painting look to it.  However during cut-scenes the filter was just down right horrible!  I mean the center of the cut-sceen looked gorgeous but the surrounding area had this dried up water-painting look (at times it looked like PS2 graphics due to the filter).  There should of been an option to turn this filter off at least for cut-scenes

SOUND/STORY
The audio quality isn't bad.  Combat sounds get a bit repetitive as does constantly spamming your skills.  The main cast does a decent job with the voice acting but at times you could clearly see ""edits"" in the dialogue and awkward pauses.  It isn't bad, but it isn't Final Fantasy quality here either so basically average.  The story is actually quite refreshing.  At first things will start slow but once the end of chapter 2 hits the storyline will draw you in.  Rather than going around owning mobs or grinding the Arena I found myself plowing through storyline quests anxious to dig up more of what is going on. Even asking around at Taverns became a bit more eventful as rumors would be going around that might give clues to the overall picture being drawn here.  Overall the storyline wasn't a masterpiece , but it actually was easy to follow and very interesting!

OVERALL (84% 8.4 / B)
Trinity: SoZO gets an 84% from me.  It is a solid RPG that might start slow but will actually get better the more time you put into it.  Questing can be a lot of fun and has plenty of variety to the quest types (hunting, escort, rescue, gathering, etc).  If you enjoy RPG's and enjoy Hack and Slash gameplay, this game does a pretty good job blending the two elements together. What comes out is a fairly good RPG that brings adventure, story and lots of gameplay to the table

PROS
- Over 40hrs of gameplay (not including extras I have yet to attempt)
- Plenty of quests to do including a 50 level Labyrinth!
- A nice variety to the combat system (12 skills per person; only 6 usable at one time... can chain skills together to make long combo chains)
- Enjoyable Storyline

CONS
- While there are tons of quests, it can be very easy to over level and end up with quests that are low level / incredibly repetitive (you revisit the same 2-3 areas over and over)
- Filter really ruins the cut-scenes
- No replay value (you can platinum trophy the game in one play-through, and there is little reason to start a brand new game over again)
- The game isn't very straight forward at times with main quest hints like ""Continue to work on advancing while separated from your party"".

The major downside to this trilogy would definitely have to be Peace Walker. I just don't ""get"" this game. It doesn't feel like a Metal Gear Solid game, there really isn't any stealth involved at all, you can't crawl, the menu system is overly complicated and poorly thought out. Enemy A.I. is rather poor too, except when you go up against the enemy vehicles, which replace the boss fights from previous MGS games, and that was another poorly thought out concept! The boss fights were always a staple in the MGS series, and these vehicle fights in Peace Walker don't match up. Although it is cool to face enemy tanks and armored vehicles, these confrontations should not have replaced the boss fights. MGS isn't MGS without boss fights!

Thus far I've managed to play through roughly 5 hours of Peace Walker but I don't plan on completing it because it just didn't hold my interest.

If you're not sure if racing is your thing, get this.  It's one of the cheapest full setups you'll find for the money and won't totally break the bank.  I for one will probably upgrade, but this bridges the gap nicely.

The Wheel - Very good quality materials, paddle shifters responsive and sturdy, decent force feedback.  Since I use this for Project Cars 2, I applied the almost mandatory Jack Spade profile, which made the FF excellent.  Others have stated this saved the game for them.

The pedals - Sturdy, somewhat heavy plastic base, good quality pedals with a good throw... except...the brake pedal.  At first I thought it was broken, but then did some research.  Logitech was trying to emulate a real brake pedal which has more resistance.  I just did a recalibrate on it and it does indeed feel more realistic.  I give light pressure for normal braking, and if I need to slam the brakes and lock up the wheels, I have to put some leg into it.  I like that.  People it's not hard, there is calibration and there are mods.  Luckily, I didn't need to mod it.

Shifter - Not too impressed, however I cannot beat Logitech up too bad, as this only cost 60 bones. It has an okay quality.  It is very loose between the grooves and I frequently miss gears because of this.  There is a relatively cheap mod to fix this as well.  It also does not have a sequential mode like other shifters.  There is a way to make this happen too, but it involves rubber bands and such.

4.0,False,"06 30, 2014",A2H94UZOP7D74C,B00EI4V3X2,DK,"FOR ACCURATE SOUND YOU NEED TO TUNE THIS HEADSET TO THE PROPER SETTING DEPENDING ON THE GAME. IF YOU FAIL TO DO THIS, YOU WILL GET BAD RESULTS AND THE SURROUND SOUND WILL SUCK. THIS IS PROBABLY WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE GIVING THIS HEADSET BAD REVIEWS, BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO TUNE IT, LOL. Now an honest review...

This is a great headset, hands down. It is truly a 100$ headset both in value and quality (not worth over $100 US in my opinion), but it does have some things I don't like. I give it a 78/100 overall. The Set-up is easy but instructions do not come with the box (not when I bought it 8 months ago anyway), so you have to go online and search ""Px4 headset set up"" in google or yahoo to figure out how to do it. The info is easy to find online so no big deal.

Here are the PROS and CONS.

1) SURROUND SOUND- 4.2/ 5

If you play CALL OF DUTY or another FPS game, this will be a great headset for you and you will definitely hear foot steps almost PERFECTLY (85-100% accuracy, depending on the map) with this baby, BUT ONLY IF YOU TUNE IT TO THE RIGHT SETTING. For COD, you need to use the 5th surround sound angle on the WiFi box/ Dynamic Chat Boost (click surround sound angle on the box until the blue light flashes to the 5 count), the 3rd setting on the TONE (click the button until you hear three beeps) and the 4th setting on the LIMITER (click the button until you hear 4 beeps) - tone and limiter are buttons found on the headset. One of the great things about surround sound in this headset is that you can customize it to your liking depending on how you ears hear sound. Most human beings hear quite similarly though, hence my recommendation for hearing footsteps in game above.

On COD: Ghosts, footsteps are very loud and easy to spot, with 100% accuracy on all maps, that's right, all maps, except those that have more than 2 stories (Chasm and Flooded), where you will have problems targeting exactly on which floor upstairs or downstairs the footsteps are coming from; and if there are a lot of people running upstairs on the 1st and second story, for example, you will have to REALLY concentrate figuring out which footstep is closer to you because it sounds as if footsteps are everywhere upstairs; I had this problem mostly on Chasm. You will still know which angle and side the footsteps are coming from, but it will be difficult pinpointing which footstep is closer to you. On every other map, the headset works really well, though, because there aren't a lot of stories. For sound whoring, this headset is 9/10 overall, which is amazing for a 100$ headset.

The surround sound is good for other games too, like racing, adventure, etc, but not great, all you have to do is adjust the TONE and LIMITER to 2 beeps for bass or 1 beep for raw sound. Good but a bit artificial. I think the surround sound is best for FPS games, to be honest, and it isn't that great with movies, which isn't surprising since you shouldn't really except a ""one in all"" headset to be great in everything.

2) COMFORT: 3.5/5

When I first bought the headset, it felt nice on my ears (I have large ears) for the first few hours, but after 6 hours of gameplay, my ears started to hurt a little and I began to notice the weight of the headset pressing on my ears a lot more than before. After 8 months of playing though, my ears got used to the headset so they don't hurt anymore no matter how long I play; but if your ears have to get used to bearing the weight of something, that generally means the weight is a little too much on the ears, doesn't it? It's fine for playing really long sessions, but you will want to take them off your head once every few hours to give your ears a break. Comfort isn't the best on this headset; this ain't no Astro in comfort, but it's still good for comfort, probably unnoticeable unless you've owned Astro's before.

3) WIRELESS: 3/5

This headset is wireless and you don't need to plug in anything while playing unless you want to chat. To make it the most wireless, go to Sound and Screen> Audio Output Settings in ps4 and make sure the output to headphones setting is on Chat Audio or All Audio (forgot which one, whichever one works after you complete the next step). Then mute your TV and turn up your headset; voila, wireless sound. The only cable you will have to plug in while playing is the short microphone cable to the ps4 controller, if you want to chat online, that's it, and also the charger if you have to charge the headset. You can also charge the headset while playing since the charging cable is very long. You can lower and raise the volume on the headset too. All of the other buttons, however, like calling and receiving calls and the mute and Bluetooth buttons are useless and don't work on the headset because ps4 still hasn't released Bluetooth compatibility. Once the patch is made, this headset for wireless will be 5/5. For now it is a 3/5.

4) BATTERY LIFE: 5/5

The battery life is one of the best I have ever seen. Once it's low on battery the headset will start beeping every 30 seconds letting you know you need to charge it. And you can charge while playing. 15 hours battery life is no lie.

5) MICROPHONE SOUND: 4.5/5

The microphone is great and ALMOST sounds as if the person is talking right next to you. It's adjustable and removable. You can also hear yourself in the background if you want to know how loud you are. The only problem is the microphone does pick up a little background sound only if someone is talking loudly in the room you play in. There is no background static or  breathing if you breathe loudly though so none of this is a problem.  (CAUTION: The MIC WILL PICK UP slight BREATHING IF THE MIC is too close to your mouth and the mic volume IS SET TO MAXIMUM; the volume of the mic should be on 50% for maximum efficiency: go to devices> audio devices> microphone devices> then lower the mic volume to half since you don't need max anyway). And you won't wake anyone up while talking at night too since you can whisper and the mic will still pick up your voice quite nicely. This mic is the best if you are alone playing the game. If you have a lot of people in your room talking a lot around you while you chat online, then don't get this headset unless you turn the mic off since people on the other end will hear your voice mostly, yes, but also other voices echoing ever so slightly in the background. This ain't no Astro when it comes to cancelling background noise.

6) BUILD: 4 /5

Not cheaply made at all. The WiFi Box is hollow but that doesn't matter. Nice and stable, still mint condition after 8 months of use.

So there you have it. A great headset worth every penny, but not without its annoying little problems. The only headset you will ever need for Ps4, unless you want to have the best and upgrade to Astro. I haven't tested the new Ps4 Gold Wireless Headset but I've heard that one is good too. I don't know if the Gold is better than the Px4 though, so you'll have to test that yourself. Gold Wireless vs. PX4 would be a great review, wouldn't it?

Right now I'm a Level 15, which is, I think halfway to the top rank. Today I actually thought about trading it in. You see unlike just about any other driving game, Grid2 punishes good drivers who get slammed around by slobs and aggros. In other words, crashes are costly. Except in the online version, I have yet to get into a room where the damage done to your car alters the performance of the car. Since Grid2 has the ability to sense who is causing the problems, this would seem to be a good thing, but if you're not running the lobby - good luck. If you are running a lobby with your friends, that's the best situation, but it has been difficult getting good races online with competent gamers who respect the basic rules.

Racing in Grid2 would seem like it's more fun, but not if you are serious about holding a racing line without a whole lot of fancy drifting. In fact, Grid2 is Oversteer Central, and it takes a while to get used to and figure out how to tame all these tail-happy cars. Even though I have mastered it on a number of the grippy cars, I still find it annoyingly different from the original Grid.  On the other hand, it is a lot more fun than the understeer and completely detuned performance of cars in Forza.

Cars are distinct and upgrade paths are simplified and clean. The interface is very crisp and you know exactly what you're getting. It's a lot easier to max out a car class in Grid2.  Although there doesn't seem to be a lot of different cars, there are plenty for a serious racer. There's a fair about of beauty, but I think it's just right and not overdone. I mean, get real. How long can you stare at a videogame car as if it were actually real.  I actually prefer the more authentic motorsportsy feel of Grid2 to Forza - I mean nobody really races half the cars on Forza.

The online and career are practically two separate games. That was a surprise.

On the whole, it is a better game than the original, but it really makes you work to get the goodies. It feels like Codemasters is teasing us. Since on the whole I like the sort of challenges, I'll give it four stars. It's a very good game, but really not quite as fun as it could be. But at least it's not hokey like Horizon.

The headphones are simply too tight which puts too much pressure which is why they break.  The soft thing wrapped in leather that goes on top of the head has a metal piece of steel inside it which is bendable.  I bent it and so far almost a year or so after my headphones are still working perfectly.  THe key to bending the piece of steel is you have to bend it at the sides, NOT in the middle otherwise the headphones wouldnt fit right.  Grab only the leather part, do not grab the plastic ear cup.  the first bend is around the T on the writing written on the headphones.  You will feel a bump underneath.  This is where the first bend is made, and then the other bend is on the other end where the writing ends at the H.  Bend it the opposite way, this will open the headphones and make them a little looser on your head.

As far as the headphones them selves go, i did this mod to help prevent the breakage problem every one else is having and so far about a year and no issues.  the cable that is from the ear cup to the remote is about 2 feet long which is horrible.

I love how it keeps track of my weight the how it graphs my progress. I like the little test it gives us before each session, though results on those tests seem to vary widely from day to day. (My Wii Fit age can be anywhere from 30 to 40.)

There are four areas we can work on: yoga, strength training, cardio and balance games. Though the cardio is included, I feel the focus of this product is in strengthening the core muscles. For someone like me, who is neither athletic nor in shape, these exercises are not easy. My neighbor's co-worker actually injured herself so badly doing the Wii Fit, that she ended up in the hospital! So, a message for the unfit: go slow.

The difficulty levels in Wii Fit increase gradually. The more Wii exercises I do, the more exercises are unlocked and I then have the choice of doing longer sessions.

YOGA

Holding those poses is not easy. Keeping the dot in the perfect spot is even harder. One of the problems with holding the dot still is that I am not always be able to see the dot from whatever position I have myself twisted into.

STRENGTH TRAINING

I found my heart beating hard after doing some of these, harder than it beat after cardio, so it can be an intense workout. Be prepared to be sore!

CARDIO

Jogging can get a little boring. I can't run faster than my little guide.

I'd get a littte frustrated with step sometimes, because I'd step, but the step wouldn't register. It's more about stepping with the beat in that game. They do let us step while watching tv, which I like; but it's not a hard workout.

The hula hooping is fun, at first. As I hula hoop, the friends throw hula hoops at me to catch, but after awhile, they stop throwing hula hoops at me for me to catch and I just have to hula hoop. I get bored just hula hooping without anything else to do.

Boxing can be fun, but I found out quickly that the jabbing motion doesn't register well. I have to ""hit like a girl"" for it to work. It would be fun if it was a true boxing game rather than the choreographed boxing game, but maybe that would turn off some women.

BALANCE GAMES

I have never been athletic, so balance is not easy for me. I have a very hard time with balance games, but balance games are the most enjoyable part of Wii Fit.

SUMMARY

Wii Fit is a great way to motivate the couch potatoes like me. My core muscles need work and this is a great help. I recommend Wii Fit for anyone like me.

For those who need cardio, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. It's not very good at focusing on that, the workout is not great (I'm not breathing very hard, and that's a bad sign because I'm very out of shape) and you might easily get bored.",Great motivator for couch potatoes,1247529600,29,,
4.0,False,"02 10, 2017",A35QJSYLRMYVH3,B00S5E4LX0,Jon,"I've owned the Rosewill 9000V2 RGB (Brown switches) for about 2 months now.

There are several things I like about this but things that I also dislike.

The RGB LEDs are on every key and they look nice however, unlike other top brands such as Logitech, Corsair, or Razer, there's no software to pair with this. You can't set specific keys to a certain brightness with some keys at full brightness. The lighting profile instructions are incredibly confusing to learn from; the manual lacks just basic explanations for procedures. There are several pre-installed RGB designs so if you just want it to look good then you should be fine.

The switches are great. I own the brown switch version and I have no problems at all. When I first used this, there was a very audible ""squeak"" noise when I pushed in the larger keys (backspace, enter, space) but after some breaking in it disappeared.

The cable is a removable mini-USB cable. One end is your typical USB male end, the other is a 90 (left) mini-USB end. Not to mention, it's a small, braided cable.

The footprint of this keyboard is, in my opinion, small. There's no other bells and whistles besides what you see in the picture. My previous keyboard, the Corsair STRAFE Red LED, had a huge ""forehead"" at the top and the keyboard was flat out massive. This has a thinner ""bezel"" - if you would - and lies rectangular with no curves.

Multimedia keys are okay at best. I appreciate them being there, since it's better than not having them at all but I guarantee you won't use any outside the volume ones.

Lastly, the LOCK LEDs are flat out awful. In the top right are NUM, SCROLL, and WINDOWS lock LEDs. They are incredibly bright; they are bright enough to light up the ceiling over the keyboard. Then, for some unknown reason, Rosewill decided to put the CAPS lock LED on the caps lock switch itself. That doesn't make any sense. Not to mention, the LED bleeds into the RGB colors heavily.

Overall, I think the keyboard is good, but not great. This keyboard, in my opinion anyways, is targeted at people who want RGB but don't want to pay $150+ for your top of the line Corsair, Razer Chroma, etc. At the same time, the lack of software alone is really off-putting. You have some wonderfully done RGB but no way to control it easily. It makes no sense. I emailed them and they said it's impossible to add it in. Because of this, I just keep my LEDs on a very low white.

Simply put, if they removed all the lighting from this keyboard, it would be perfect. It would be a solid $80 keyboard.

Note: The keyboard doesn't go fully into sleep when the PC is off. If you click a button, it wakes up and stays on until you unplug it. Rosewill support also said this is something they cannot fix.

And the included pictures don't do the keyboard justice. Use it only as a reference.

Edit: It has been many months since I used this keyboard and have since switched to a different TKL one. However, I think the issue with the keyboard not turning off with the PC is a USB-port issue. The port doesn't turn off unless a specific setting is checked off.

Though I own nearly every non-GameCube title in the undead thriller's history, I'd never been able to stand one long enough to actually complete it, right up until this past week. I'd always found the series to be misleading, disguising itself as a straightforward action title before slowing the gameplay down to a crawl and relying on endless puzzles and feats of memory to lengthen completion times. Time after time, I'd sit down with the goal of finally tackling these games, and time after time I'd get bored, stuck or distracted, leaving the game behind. I grabbed Resident Evil 3 when it was relatively new, and the title has sat, unplayed, on my shelf for years. That was, as I said, until this past week, when I sat down with renewed vigor and vowed to complete the first title in the series, even if it drove me to madness.
I'll make it really blunt; the story is absolutely terrible. The uninspiring characters meander their way through the events without a care in the world, occasionally encountering plot holes large enough to drive an oversized bus through. Nagging issues, such as why somebody would lock their home's single shotgun away in a room that's only accessible through a string of unrelated tricks and puzzles, aren't even touched upon. What if somebody breaks in, in the middle of the night? Is the owner of the mansion really going to have time to roll out of bed, run downstairs, jog to one side of the house, move around a couple statues, grab a key, run to another corner of the house, open a door, grab a fake shotgun, return to the original side of the house, unlock the doors and replace the ""real"" shotgun with the fake? I suppose the story does the right thing by failing to even mention these things, but they'll still tug away at the back of your mind as you play.
The graphics of the first Resident Evil really haven't aged well. Humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically, each one looking almost identical to the others. Polygon models are simple and blocky. Textures are pixelated and undetailed, looking more like a game assembled on the Super Nintendo's SuperFX chip than a PlayStation title. The series' characteristic pre-rendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places, forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room. Merging still images with live polygons, Resident Evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the PC classics ""Myst"" and ""Alone in the Dark.""
The bread and butter of any console title, its gameplay, is the one area where you'll really learn to love or hate this series. Rather than bothering with camera angles and awkward environments, Capcom has instead sent players through a series of screens, occasionally containing interactive elements of their own. You'll control Jill or Chris from a series of dramatic angles, never in control of the camera itself. They'll enter a screen on the left side, mosey around a little bit, kill a couple zombies and leave the screen on the right side, immediately entering the next screen from another direction. Though it was a somewhat novel concept at the time of its release, this scheme brought with it numerous problems, the most notable of which was your interaction with enemies on the next screen. It's not uncommon to run full throttle off the edge of one screen, only to find a zombie waiting for you right at the edge of the next. It's a really cheap way to take a hit, and can mean a speedy, frustrating death in later stages.
Looking back, the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary. Rather than applying a more traditional platformer's control layout, Resident Evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotation-based configuration. Left and right don't serve to strafe, they stop the character's movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place. Up moves you forward, and down moves backwards. Pressing R1 draws your weapon, and pressing X at the same time fires. It's a scheme that's more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship that's defined the action portions of this series since day one.
Many of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion aren't so much brain teasers as they are time wasters. You'll realize what needs to be done within moments, but chances are good you won't have the piece needed to do so on your person. It took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as Chris, cautiously walking around, learning the position of the zombies, figuring out the puzzles, groaning as I realized the piece I needed was sitting in a chest, fifteen minutes away, and repeating that process. The second time through, playing as Jill and remembering which random item I would need where, I finished in three hours and twenty minutes. That's one heck of a variation.
The soundtrack to the first Resident Evil is really something that's difficult to categorize. Imagine, if you can, a blend of symphonic suspense, the song that plays when you push ""demo"" on a keyboard, and elevator music. That's Resident Evil's melody. The composer tried to capitalize on the few ""jump out of your seat"" moments the storyline provided, but surrounded by cheesy samples, monotonously repeating tunes and quality that sounds more like something on the N64 than the PSX, there was only so much that could be done.
On the large, this was a different kind of game than what we were getting at the time, something fresh. It wasn't a blockbuster, oh-my-god-get-me-the-sequel-now, mind numbing experience. I can understand why a game like this would deserve a sequel, but even today I couldn't have predicted the amount of games it would spawn.","A Solid, Unsuspecting Launchpad for Survival Horror",1054684800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I'm a huge James Bond fan. I love the movies. I mix up the martinis when I watch my DVD collection at home. I have all the console games based on the game. So I had high hopes for the GameCube version of this much-loved franchise. While the game was fun, it didn't have quite the thrill of some of the other games in the series.
The graphics are great. And the special gadgets they have are great. But you can get through the game in just a few hours, and the multiplay in this game just aren't as good as in previous games.

However, Bungie generally does not make the same mistakes that Lucas did, for which we can be thankful. Although I felt it could have been a little better, the story for Reach is well developed and artfully told. The characters are rather static, but they have always tended to be in the Halo games. The gameplay is great, with enough similarities to the previous games to make it familiar to the gamer, but including enough new variations and tweaks to make it feel fresh. The graphics and musical score are both excellent.

Where this game really really shines, however, is the multiplayer. Halo: Reach brings many new game types to the table, with tons of different versions within each type. Firefight has evolved from the fun past-time of ODST to a fully customizable onslaught of foes that will take a long time to get old. New variants like Invasion and Headhunter are very fresh and fun to play, and the additions of the different loadouts, although a bit different than what Halo players are used to, is to me at least a very excellent addition.

Sadly, while the NWN platform itself was a major breakthrough, the included gameplay was routine, uninspired, and sometimes even silly. Shadows of Undrentide (SoA) shows that the Bioware crew can not only create a great technical product, but also deliver a solid story.
Unlike the original NWN storyline, SoA has a coherent plot that, while short of ""compelling,"" kept me interested. The fact that it was written for single-player mode meant the storytellers could focus on developing non-player characters rather than try to have the story work with lots of different players (not an easy task!). While many have complained about the lack of multi-player support, personally I've been unable to commit to that kind of gameplay anyway, and the few experience I've had were disappointing.
The fact that NWN is both a generalized toolset and a game means a lot of tradeoffs: one is that the graphics and environments become pretty uninspiring after a while because they re-use the same assets over and over again. To me, this is almost a blessing, as it forces story developers to focus more on the story rather than dazzle players with graphics.
Toolset enhancements and expanded assets (monsters, spells, etc.) make this expansion essential for those of us creating content.
Although not approaching the peaks of the Infinity Engine series of games, the NWN platform still has a lot of room for growth, whatever the power-gamers who want shiny graphics instead of good stories might say.","Better story, better puzzles, better characters",1066953600,3,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

4.0,False,"04 28, 2010",ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B000SQ5LQ4,Poisoned Blade,"In the latest installment of the Splinter Cell series, Sam Fisher hides in shadows and kills bad guys who cuss like drunken sailors after a bad night of gambling.

Story:  7/10
In Conviction, Sam comes out of retirement and goes after corrupt government officials who are intent on throwing the country into chaos.
The story is well told through cut scenes and in game dialogue, with some great voice acting by Michael Ironside.  If I said any more, I think I'd spoil the story so I'll stop here.

Gameplay: 8/10
I'd categorize this game as a stealth / shooter.  Faithful fans of the series may see these new innovations as dumbed down, and action fans may find that the new innovations assist them with the stealth gameplay.  Like previous Splinter Cell games, Sam hides in the dark.  You can shoot out lights, use EMP pulses and grenades, or flashbangs to disorient your enemies.  You also get sonar goggles late in the game, that detect enemy positions through walls (Similar to Batman: Arkham Asylum.)  Sam is also equipped with various weapons:  One pistol, and one other weapon that is a submachine gun, a shotgun, rifle...  Once you are discovered, the game becomes a shooter, causing you to rely on frag grenades and your secondary weapons to take out the bad guys.  In Splinter Cell Conviction, the game also shows a ghosted Sam if you are detected, which shows the ""last known position"" of Sam.  If you see this appear, you can expect the enemies to converge on your ghost or throw grenades.  It's best to distance yourself from this position ASAP.  The good news is that you are fast.  So if the enemies do spot you, you can quickly circle around them and flank them.  Another mechanic at your disposal is the Mark and Execute Attack.  If you take out any bad buy with a melee attack (stealth neck break, disarm, jumping down from above, pulling them through a window...) you can mark enemies.  To mark an enemy, put the cursor on them and press RB and you will see an icon above their heads.  You can mark 2 or 3 at a time depending on your gun.  Once marked, you can Execute them in slo-mo by pressing the Y button.  So, if you encounter 4 enemies, and one has his back to you, you can melee kill him.  Mark 2 of them while you are still hidden.  Head Shot Kill one of them.  Then quickly press Y to insta-kill the remaing 2 that you marked.  This technique makes Sam awfully powerful if you want to rely on this strategy.

Levels: 7/10
Most of the levels in the game require you to stealth around and take out bad guys.  A few of the levels are confusing, where you aren't quite sure what to do or what constitutes a ""fail.""  Some of the levels are straight up Gears of War style action gunfights.

Graphics: 6/10
Splinter Cell Conviction uses the Unreal Engine.  The game looks good, not great.  But the game also does itself a disservice.  When you are stealthed, the game desaturates the colors, so the game appears dark and black and white.  If you are in the light, the game saturates the colors back to normal.  So, if you are playing correctly, the game is very dark and colorless.  This doesn't help at all in the graphics department.

Sound: 8/10
The music is exciting and the stealth tracks are suspenseful.  The gunfights and gear do a great job at punctuating the action.

Replay Value: 8/10
The Campaign is only 5-6 hours long, but the game makes up for it with their Mission Modes.  Play solo or with a friend, to enter a level and take out all of the bad guys.  If you are seen, the bad guys get reinforcements, which increases their number by about 10.  I felt that these Missions were more fun than the campaign.

Maturity: M
There're head shots, a bit of realistic gun violence, no sexual situations, and CRAZY amounts of profanity.
Pretty much every bad guy says stuff like, ""I'm gonna get you Fisher!  When I find you, I'm gonna **** you with a puppy that I ****** to death, then **** your grandma in the *** with it while I **** a ***** then **** a **** down your ******!!!!""  Yeah, it's a bit much.

Overall: 7/10
If you're a fan of the series, you'll enjoy playing this game.  Hardcore stealth fans may be turned off by the new mechanics and shooter aspects, but these same mechanics make the game more fun for action fans.  If you are great at shooters, you could probably play this game barely using any stealth at all.
Buy it if you're a fan of the series and you have friends you can play with online.
Rent it if you want to play an action / stealth combo.
Rent it if you liked the older Splinter Cell games, but thought they were too hard.

It took the normal shooter game and added in changes in environment - you moved through time to persue your enemies. TimeSplitters 2 expands this with better graphics, sound, and multiplay features.
The plot isn't much to get enthusiastic about. An evil enemy race is trying to wipe out humanity, and they have a time portal. They run back through time with crystals and you have to go back into each time period to track down the crystal and do other miscellaneous tasks while you're there.
The graphics are indeed nice, from flaming torches to dreary sewers and polished marble floors. But when you compare them to the likes of Halo or Kingdom Hearts, they're a bit old looking. There aren't shadows. The backgrounds aren't very dynamic. You shoot walls and get tiny holes, unlike the deformable terrain of other current games. The textures seem flat and a bit repetitive.
They did make an attempt to have the sounds match the eras, with lovely chanting during Notre Dame and twanging during the Western era. Even so, you don't feel 'immersed' in the game. Characters don't make noise when they walk. There isn't really any ambient noise.
The weapon choices are fun and time-appropriate. In Chicago of 1932, you've got Tommy Guns. In Notre Dame you're playing with shotguns. So there's always new variety as you go from level to level.
The missions aren't very challenging compared to other games that are out. They are extremely linear and there's rarely any brainpower involved. There's side missions like ""blow up file cabinets along the way"" or ""shoot out whiskey barrels"". There's usually a rationale given but it's pretty flimsy.
There are other 'mini-games' that you can play. Do things like fight off the living dead, smash the glass and so on. Try to get the best times to get high rankings.

To give you an idea, I have two character builds; SL 84 Warrior, SL 119 Sorcerer.  I say this to let you know this review is coming from someone who loves the Souls series and understands how to use the games mechanics to progress quickly and efficiently.  This game can be best described as some sort of hybrid/clone of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.  Some improvements have been made, but there are flaws that need to be addressed.  This review focuses primarily on the pros and cons of the game as I see them, rather than the generic graphics and fun factor discussion.

IMPROVEMENTS:

This game is somewhat more difficult than its predecessors.  This will be immediately apparent in the very first stage.  To give you an idea; in the original Dark Souls, I beat the tutorial and first stage while dying once.  In Dark Souls II, I played for 3 hours and died 10 times before seeing the first boss.  This game was designed for veteran souls players in mind... for anyone new to the series, I would not jump in without having played Dark Souls first.

There are now multiple bosses per level.  I find this change both compelling and refreshing.  This allows for increased multiplayer and PVP opportunities as you can summon and invade even after one or two bosses are defeated.

This game is designed much better to be played as a community.  You should NOT do much of anything by yourself in Dark Souls II unless you consider yourself among the elite of the hardcore.  Either summon, or be summoned, and you will obtain frequent success.

The game world is very large and varied.  There is so much to explore and so many alternate paths per level that you can complete a level while only discovering about 60% of what is has to offer.  Exploration is fantastic, the only drawback is when you summon, many of your helpers will want to take the quickest path to the boss and bypass secrets/treasures just to complete the stage.

Summoning works much better than in Dark Souls.  I have summoned someone in under 3 seconds; and this is coming from someone with terrible/unstable/slow internet service.  Multiplayer works flawlessly but there still might be some lag with invasions.

The PS3 Souls Community has become incredibly experienced/skilled.  You will be amazed at how good the players you summon really are and that makes some boss fights feel much easier even though they really are not.

An impressive amount of NPCs.  There are so many NPCs, vendors, covenants, phantoms in this game you will lose track.  On the other hand, you'll have access to greater amounts of  game lore and items than ever before.

Bond fire frequency/placement.  Bond fires have been setup up to be much more forgiving this time around.  You will have one pretty much after every boss so with only a few exceptions, you will not be at risk of losing a large amounts of souls.

Leveling up incredibly easy.  (This might be considered a negative depending on your perspective).  A lot of people are saying that you can't farm because some enemies stop respawning after bosses are defeated.  I would say this has been the easiest game to level up in the entire series.  All you have to do is keep getting summoned at levels/boss fights and WIN, and you will rack up an incredible amount of souls in no time.  In addition, if you find/purchase the right equipment, item drops happen at an alarming rate.  I've gotten five copies of weapons/armor in a single stage.

FLAWS:

Your health bar drops every time you die.  I don't mind this as much as other people, but in the more difficult stages when you hit a wall (and you WILL hit the wall), this can become unbearable.  Treat  those effigies (to become human again) as if they were the most precious item in existence because they are.  Do whatever you have to to stock up because you will need them under this system.  Alternatively, you can regain humanity by being summoned and helping someone defeat the boss.

Enemies have lost their unique/specialized fighting styles from Dark Souls.  In Dark Souls, you had to truly study each enemy fighting style and adapt accordingly several times per stage.  In Dark Souls II, the enemies are not as intricate or deep.  What makes them more difficult is there now come in more mobs/swarms.  In some places, you will have to face 4-5 very strong enemies simultaneously and it detracts from the fighting experience.  It saddens me to say that for the most part, fighting here is like playing checkers, it's not like the chess of the first Dark Souls.

You can be invaded while being hallow.  I personally believe this to be one of the biggest aggrievances in the game.  I have been in situations where I cannot find a summon sign to help me, my health bar is low cause I've died too many times, and the enemies are so dangerous and powerful that I spend more time running away than fighting.  Now just imagine being invaded while under those circumstances.  You are all alone, weak, low on resources, without allies, and without even the slightest semblance of hope or victory.  This is Dark Souls II.

****WARNING: 4 MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD****  Skip the next four lines if you wish to go in completely blind.

Obtaining ultimate souls weapons is entirely too easy.  I remember in previous games, you have to farm the building materials, find the right NPC, gather enough souls, find the ember; it was a tremendous investment in time and resources.  Now, all you have to do is find/unlock the right NPC and trade in the soul for the ultimate weapon; that's it.  This is absurdly easy/simple.

There is a version of 'Blightown' in this game that is an even worse nightmare for me at least.  You won't be able to see much of anything, you will be lost and have no sense of direction or where to go.  It truly is a pure hell much worse than the stages that follow.

You can be FORCED into PVP.  That's right, in certain levels there is a covenant that can FORCE you to invade them, have you fight the stage's enemies AND them at the same time.  This is completely unacceptable and should not have been included in this game.

Some bosses repeat near the end of the game.  I cannot describe how much I hate it when I see the same boss again.  They even drop the same soul again so you can have multiple souls of the same boss in one playthrough.  There are no excuses for this.

The beauty / cohesiveness / continuity of the original Dark Souls world has been lost.  Now, you can and must warp from bonfire to bonfire from the very beginning.  While this is extremely convenient, it disrupts the Dark Souls formula too much.  You know that at any time, you can escape the level and just warp somewhere else.  In Dark Souls, you had to stick it out until you conquered the area which I believe added to the experience.  This is no longer the case.

You cannot level up or upgrade equipment at the bonfire.  It is such a waste of time to have to warp to an NPC just to have to level up every time.  In Demon's Souls it was cool because the worlds were separate, but in Dark Souls II it just doesn't fit.

Overall, notwithstanding these flaws, I thoroughly enjoy this game.  It is still incredibly addictive for those that wish to conquer and obtain ultimate power and mastery given the true horrors that await.  I love the Souls series through and through and cannot get enough of this experience.  It will be inconceivably brutal; inevitably there will come a time when you will want to put the controller down and not come back.  But don't for one second give up.  Continue, and all those feelings of frustration, failure, despair, hopelessness and unparalleled glory that is the hallmark of the souls series will be yours.",A True Souls Veteran Review...,1394928000,38,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,False,"10 23, 2015",ARADXCOUVBS09,B00ZJEMMKI,Gavin Scott,"These are nicer than I was expecting from the pictures. They fit snugly and comfortably for me without extending the headband, so the band may be a touch larger than average. You can extend each side by about an inch if your head is even larger. The ear cups are comfortable and provide a reasonable amount of passive noise cancelling. The headphones emit some sound into your surrounding environment, so you won't be able to play next to someone without them hearing that there's sound going on.

The mic boom is fixed and rigid and folds up 90 degrees when you don't need it. There's no mute LED or other indication of MUTE state. The cable is flat (like a linguine noodle) and only one meter long which is just about perfect for plugging into a controller or a laptop, but you'll probably want and extension to use it with a desktop computer. For its intended purpose though it's just right.

They come with two AAA batteries which are required for the lighting, volume controls, and haptic quadboost effect. If you don't install the batteries or switch off ""active mode"" then they operate as regular passive headphones. The audio is about the same in both modes, though with the internal amplification turned on I thought it sounded a bit crisper. The batteries are supposed to last around 20 hours, and there seems to be no auto power-off, so you better remember to turn them off after use (the green glow of the lighting should help as a reminder).

In active mode both sides light up with a green LED that illuminates a clear plastic window with a circuit diagram pattern, beyond which you can see the circuit board on the left one and the batteries (:P) on the right.

There's a dial to set the level of the ""quadboost"" which is described in different places as a ""bass boost"" and a ""haptic effect"". Honestly there's no detectable effect on the audio from adjusting this, and you get just as much bass either way. What you DO get with the effect turned up and a sufficient input volume level is a medium-strong haptic vibration effect that vibrates the headphones against your head. This actually seems kind of cool and adds the same sort of additional effect as controller vibration (though it's simply a side effect of strong bass input level and not actually controlled by the game). A bit like sitting on a sub-woofer while playing.

In active mode you have mute and up/down volume buttons on the outside of the left ear cup. Volume can be increased above or attenuated below the level you would get in passive mode. All three of these controls are buttons that involve deforming the plastic outer layer of the case to press the actual buttons. The mute isn't too bad being a large area at the top, but the volume button areas are small and provide little to no tactile indication of where to press, so making volume adjustments in active mode is actually quite annoying. I would much rather have had actual exposed buttons or a rotary knob for this. You'll probably find a volume level that you like and then may find it easier to change the volume from the source rather than on the headphones.

The cable ends in a single for conductor plug. For an XBOX One controller you'll need the version which has the appropriate 3.5mm jack, or if you have one of the older ones you can get an adapter. These headphones will also work with most recent laptops that have a single-jack mic/headphone connection, and many other devices as well. The unfortunately don't come with a Y adapter for use with PCs that have separate heaphone and mic jacks, but these are easily and inexpensively available.

The audio sounds excellent, both for gaming as well as music and video watching on multiple devices. The construction seems excellent, though pretty much all plastic, so they seem like they should last a long time as long as you don't drop or step on them too much.

Total weight with batteries is 11 ounces. I found wearing them for an extended period of time was comfortable (they did not press on my ears and become painful the way other headphones have in the past). They are completely enclosed but have not become uncomfortably warm.

They come with very minimal documentation (typical for a game accessory), a two year limited warranty. and there's a $10 ""PDP Reward Card"" in the box which might be good for a discount on further stuff from the company, though it points you to a web page that's 404.

So far I've found nothing that would prevent me from recommending them. The volume/mute controls are a bit annoying, and while construction seems good, they don't feel quite as indestructible as some others. However the weight is good, audio quality is excellent, and the haptic feedback feature actually seems to add to the gaming experience.

So, 4.5 stars rounding down to 4 in this case I think, and recommended.

Graphically the game looks sweet. Sound is also spot on and controls are good, but too many of the moves rely on slightly imprecise moves of the analog stick up or down with a button. It's not bad, but could have been executed a little better.

Overall there is a lot to like about Dragon's Crown. The Vita hasn't exactly had a great list of games this year, but this game and the upcoming Killzone and Batman games look to change that trend.

I do think the price of $40 is a bit steep for this game, which feels more like a PSN only download game. $20-$25 would have been where I would have predicted the price should have been. It's less than 1GB in size, so it's not a bad option to download the game rather than buy a physical copy. One reason for this would be if you own two Vita systems and want the game on both.

I pre-ordered and then suffered through the release date being pushed back, back again and then forward.  Fortunately it was all worth the wait.  There hasn't been a zombie game this well done, this challenging and this much fun in a long time.  I've been waiting for a  perfect open world zombie game for years and Dying Light almost delivered.

PROS:
-  Graphics are pretty amazing.
-  Open World. You can pretty much go anywhere and explore everything
-  Near perfect difficulty level. Just frustrating enough at times to keep you interested and easy enough where it should be. Once you master the game you can even try hard mode to make things even more difficult!
-  The Developers actually listen to the gaming community and appear to be committed to furthering this franchise based on the gaming community's feedback
-  Parkour and combat are very well mixed
-  A great balance between firearms and melee weapons
-  Realistic progression with weapons and skills. You need to spend a little time grinding it out in order to upgrade your weapons early on
-  Establishing safe houses around the map is helpful and fun
-  Roam around and loot, search and bash zombies when you aren't in the mood to do missions etc.

The single player offline campaign mode has been so much fun I haven't even tried much with multiplayer yet and I've owned the game since release day

CONS:
-  The campaign isn't too long but expect to invest a significant amount of time in order to upgrade your weapons etc. It seems like a long time if you're a busy gamer that can only play in shorter spurts.
 -  I wish this had a local coop mode but you'll hear me say that about most zombie games these days
-  I find the concept of ""crafting"" weapons in zombie games to be a bit tired and over done. I wasn't excited when I heard this announced for Dying Light, but it's actually done pretty well and can significantly improve your melee weapon effectiveness
-  Weapons can be damaged and most can only be repaired a certain number of times  The concept of weapons being able to be damaged or brokn makes this game realistic. Unfortunately it happens at the most inconvenient times if you don't pay attention. I'm most irritated with the fact that most weapons can only be repaired a certain amount of times before they're junk.

Overall Dying Light is a blast. I don't feel disappointed in spending $59.99 which is rare with many console games I encounter.  If your'e on the fence I'd say get it.

I personally resolved this by countersinking the opening of each thumb-stick (approximately an additional 1/32"") allowing the thumbstick to slide a bit further down on the shaft and therefore clear the inside of the housing.

And I cannot comment on anything else since I couldn't play the first one at all. So, it was nice to see what I was missing. Law and Order 2: Double or Nothing, just like the TV show, has two halves: detective and lawyer. While I've played as the detective in numerous of games, I never experienced one as a lawyer before. I'll say that was a pretty fun experience. The best part of Law and Order 2: Double or Nothing is its plot. Somehow, during the game play, how the story unfolded was getting bizarrely stupid, but the time the case arrives at the court and how it explained, the story started to make more and more sense. As for the detective side, I thought it came fairly easy and routine, so solving that part wasn't hard for me as it took me a couple of hours in one sitting. One thing I didn't like about it is the strictness of the questions when I would like to be flexible in asking more. Other than that, I do not have a complaint. Now, on the lawyer side, I actually thought my case was falling apart, and I was very inclined to agree with the defending attorney that the case ought to be dropped during the trial. Somehow, I just got lucky and made through the first two days. Honestly, I could have prepared the case so much better than the female lawyer and presented a much more convincing argument. How the case survived the first two days is beyond my brain. Mostly, all I had in my mind is that I really need the gun to seal the case, and it turns out to be the life-saving moment. The most surprising moment was finding out that the judge threw out the boots because of the stupid technical error. If that was the case, then the detective should have known better about that since he has like at least twenty years of experience. The most challenging part of the lawyer side is the hitting of the hand to object during the line of questioning by the defending lawyer. In the end, I also solved the case the first time, so I would say it wasn't that hard, but I was walking on a very thin ice most of the time, thanks to the incompetence of the lawyer I played as.

4.0,False,"11 2, 2008",A306153FTKS9PL,B000X1PE16,Turtle502,"Dead Space is one of those games that simply every gamer must play. It is nearly flawless in terms of design and gameplay. The story is virtually tightly-woven and will keep you entertained until the credits roll.

Level design is probably the most interesting that I have seen in a game yet. Although there are dead-end points on each level, and sometimes you need to travel to these points, for the main missions the levels typically loop around a central ""safe"" area, so that if you leave that area in one direction, you'll return to it using a completely different path. This prevents a lot of backtracking and keeps things fresh.

The enemy AI is typical for survival-horror. None of the enemies take cover, none of them really hide from you, they simply charge at you. This can sometimes be annoying in certain areas, especially when you are trapped in a room with quite a few of them during a quarantine sequence. I consider these spikes in difficulty (or ""mini-bosses""), which can frustrate at times until you develop your own strategy for handling them. Completing these moments is fun and satisfying.

The third person viewpoint works well for this game. You really get a sense of what is attacking your character.  The complete 360-degree movement of the camera around the character is amazing, allowing you to keep track of everything around you at all times. The camera, however, is not without its flaws: if you back into a corner, Isaac will virtually disappear, or you won't be able to pan the camera in the direction you need it most. This can lead to some very frustrating deaths.

The lack of a HUD display is welcomed. You really become integrated with the character since everything you need to know is displayed on the back of the suit or on the weapon equipped. The inventory system is interesting. You can equip up to four weapons at a time, and switch quickly between them using the D-pad. Having certain weapons equipped determines what ammo pick-ups you'll find during the game. I especially enjoyed the fully-integrated store and safe, so that you could easily manage your inventory in one spot. However, although weapons were a button-click away from reloading, refilling the power to your ""stasis"" ability requires navigating into the inventory during play, while being attacked during battle. The number of button presses required to do that was simply annoying, and quite often took me ""out-of-the-game"", leading to some frustrating deaths.

The upgrade system is interesting but tedious. Depending upon how you spend the cash you locate throughout the game, and how much you conserve ammo, you might be able to upgrade fairly quickly. Upgrading requires acquiring power nodes that are inserted into slots on an electrical schematic. It's slow and tedious, although most players will be able to upgrade the most important equipment by the end of the game.

The game is quite immersive and will make you lose all track of time while you are playing. What seems like 5 minutes will turn into an hour, easily. The game has excellent atmosphere, and everthing comes together to make a nearly perfect virtual experience -- level design, textures, enemies (there are fast enemies that are really creepy!), sound, and music. The musical score is very similar to that found in the Alien/Aliens movies, and is very fitting to this game. Near the end of the game, it becomes less scary -- but still remains extremely tense and anxious.

On the normal difficulty, expect to play between 15-20 hours. Ultimmately, it depends how cautious you are and whether you explore every possible area in the game. The achievements for the 360 are well-designed and should provide at least some replay value. Most gamers will probably play this title twice. Potential downloadable content -- in the form of suits and weapons -- could provide extended play in the future, but the game is not designed to support new maps.  With all of this in mind, this is a ""must-play"" game, not a ""must-own"" game.

Theisen,"The King of All Cosmos, infamous for his continuous talk of himself and our protagonist in the second-person, is back and offbeat as ever. Katamari Forever pushes the knob up even higher by offering not one, but two Kings for your enjoyment. We are quite moved to tears by the insanity of it. The charm of the series has returned and offers even more inexplicable gameplay than before, giving us another just-for-fun and family friendly Playstation 3 exclusive. To newcomers to the series I will spell out the cardinal rule of the Katamari series; nothing will ever, ever make sense. It's not supposed to, so just go with it. Laugh at any random little thing you want, since there's no time where it would be inappropriate to laugh. Also, keep in mind that since the game is originally Japanese that a lot of the story ""animations"" and items you'll be rolling up won't be familiar to an American audience... but this doesn't at all subtract from the fun.

It seems the King has lost his memory after being stuck by an asteroid during a jumping contest, forcing The Prince and his Cousins to create a robot King to keep order of the universe and create new stars. Further details are not important, but it brings us to the ""gimmick"" of this game and what gives it its depth-- besides there being plenty of new ball-rolling quests to undertake, you'll be revisiting a lot of the classics we've already seen (mostly from 'We Love Katamari'). Naturally, recycled content can only count so much, but it's rewarding and fun to play them all over again now with high definition graphics and a storyline even sillier than last time.

Well then, time to get being your infinitely-sticky katamari and roll up the galaxy once more, one room at a time. The game controls remain wonderfully simple and precise, with all game control done with the two analog sticks. Turns, spins, etc... all of it is done without having to push a button, and the game even makes use of the L3 and R3 buttons as one of your special moves. One new feature here is the ""Prince Hop"" jump which comes from the motion sensing of the Dualshock 3 controller. It can be kind of awkward and requires one to be sitting up perfectly straight to pull off, but there don't really seem to be any times during the game where you're forced to use it. Consider it just an optional bonus wacky game feature.

Just in case your eyeballs weren't already popped open and fixated on the blob of items before you, there are some beautiful new artistic touches added. The tried-and-true ""old"" graphics are gone-- not the modeling, but the coloring and shading. ""Watercolor"" and ""Sketchbook"" are good words to describe the environment you'll find to start. In case these don't quite sit well with you, there is an option you can unlock that changes the style to your choosing... including the original coloring and filter you're accustomed to. One quite clever graphical gimmick is that when 'recreating' a katamari from the past to return the King's memories, the level will start out as little more than a black and white fuzz outline of the environment. Quite literally, you're digging around his memory and fixing it. As you roll over objects and get larger, more and more comes out in color.

As is tradition for the series, the soundtrack is top-notch ...in its wildly quirky style, mind you. A lot of the songs are remixes of things we've heard before, but it sounds fresh nonetheless and never gets dull no matter how many times you might repeat a level. Just in case you're sick of a default music, you're free to change the track before you start your next adventure. Along the same lines as the music never getting dull, the levels won't wear your out and you'll likely be repeating levels several times in order to get better results and try to drag out even a few words of praise from the King or Robot King. Besides just the normal size and time results from the past, you're now given a letter grade mark as well as a score on a scale of 1 to 100. Getting top ranks over 80 can be quite challenging, so try to look past how depressed and sad the Robot King gets when things don't go quite right and keep trying. Replay value is, thus, excellent.

Of the few critiques I might give is a lack of online play. There are leaderboards for results of the normal missions and there are 2-player game modes, but nothing you can do with a distant friend or random player. Since this is far from a competitive game once can forgive Namco for not wanting to pit players against one another competitively, but the option for it still would have been nice. Besides that, I really don't know what the game could do to warrant a 5-star rating... but there is only so much a game like this can do. It will never be an epic multi-million pop culture title like Action and Role Playing games can, but then again this is never supposed to be. Why try to fix what isn't broken? This is both the basis for fun and the crutch of the Katamari series.

What are you waiting for? Get rolling! We eagerly await your results. Though far from a deep and complex puzzle game, Katamari Forever will give a great 'smiles per dollar' rating on the purchase price and is the type of game absolutely anyone can pick up and enjoy just like the other games in the series. Very few other games can manage to appeal to all ages and audiences like 'Katamari' can.",We are Moved to Tears by the Joy of It,1253664000,,,
4.0,False,"11 24, 2009",AMKG2LY6IDY5D,B0001Y7404,David Rey,"Okay I went back and forth with this game.  First let me say this game DOES NOT SUCK as some people say.  It does have its cons but its not a bad game at all.  Now that I've played through it I think this game is VERY good!

Most of the arguments against it usually have to do with character development and escort mission and going back to the room, etc.  Or some just say, ""oh this wasn't supposed to be a Silent Hill game"".  Well that still doesn't mean they didn't make a good game and a story line to fit it into the Silent Hill series.  Also, if you really pay attention, they do develop the characters and everything, even the ghosts fit into place.

This was the first Silent Hill game I played and let me say, I had to put it down for a while because it just freaked me out too much.  Then I got Silent Hill 2 and was addicted to playing it til I beat it.  I loved that game and still do but then I saw what people meant when they said SH4 veered away from the SH formula.

I then went on to get SH3 and SH1 and Origins.  After playing them all now, I must say that though I absolutely LOVE SH1 and SH2, SH4 is definitely one of the most scariest to me.  I think they really managed to make a very creepy atmosphere and story that is hard to get out of your mind.  This game is full of ""WTF was THAT!"" moments.

The graphics are good in this game.  But again, I believe the reason we play these games is not so much for the graphics but for the atmosphere it creates and to get scared or freaked out.  Resident Evil doesn't do that for me (ie RE4), but Silent Hill does and Silent Hill 4 has a lot of PSYCHO moments.

Also, the ghosts that some complain about can get annoying if you don't know how to handle them or have a weapon to pin them down.  But once you know what to do, then they are not an issue.

The only thing I didn't like was the need to keep going back to the Room to change weapons, but at the same time that gave you an opportunity to see some freaky stuff happening... I don't want to give any spoilers!  XD

Also the escort mission is not that bad, in fact, it is a WHOLE lot better than Resident Evil 4 where Ashley, the president's daughter, doesn't even help you fight!  In this one Eileen HELPS you fight even though she is injured!  Also you watch her from the very beginning through a hole in the wall which helps you start to actually care for her.

Everything fits together well in this game if you let it and give it a chance.  It gives some background to SH2 and the history of Silent Hill as a whole.  Anyway, I suggest if you want a good scare then pick this up used.  It is an awesome game.","May not be the BEST Silent Hill game, but its the SCARIEST",1259020800,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Whitehead,"A band of adventurers arrive at Easthaven, a town in the Icewind Dale region of Faerun, far to the north of most civilised lands on the far side of the Spine of the World. The town's mayor asks the adventurers to travel to Kuldahar, a village of druids in the foothills of the mountains, where they have reported strange goings-on. The adventurers agree, but are cut off in the foothills by an avalanche. Proceeding to Kuldahar on foot through an area inhabited by hostile creatures, the adventurers learn of a threat to all of Faerun that is developing in the mountains and the caverns under them, and they must defeat this threat before it's too late.

Originally released in 2000, Icewind Dale was the third of the Dungeons and Dragons games using the Infinity Engine, developed by BioWare and Black Isle (now Obsidian). These three games were effectively an attempt to corner three distinct types of fantasy: Planescape: Torment was the 'arty', literary and philosophical game, essentially a video game equivalent to Gene Wolfe, whilst Baldur's Gate was the more traditional large-scale, long, broad-based and well-characterised epic, following in the trail of Tolkien. Icewind Dale, on the other hand, was the much more combat-oriented, sword and sorcery adventure, much more of a romp than the other two. This led it to getting somewhat mixed reviews at the time, though viewed in isolation from its forebears, its positive aspects become much more apparent.

Starting off, Icewind Dale has you creating all six characters in the party, giving them names and deciding on their races and character classes. This is unlike Baldur's Gate, where you only created the leading character and then picked from a range of pre-existing companions, and also unlike Planescape: Torment, where you had a pre-generated character (though you could change his stats). This is the biggest change from the other games, since your party is totally user-generated there is little to none of the party interplay seen elsewhere. There is no possibility of romances or rivalries erupting between party-members, which removes some of the flavour and unpredictability of the earlier games, but also makes Icewind Dale a lot more old-school and traditional, which is not entirely a bad thing.

Once you've created your party, it's RPG business as usual. You can explore the opening town, solve a few puzzles (usually through item quests or combat, though you can resolve a few quests through dialogue alone) and so on before you're given the main quest. You have to fight your way through the mountains to Kuldahar (a town built in and around a colossal tree), which becomes your base of operations as you range out on various missions for the denizens of the town. These involve a lot of dungeon explorations and assaults on temples and castles held by various enemies, so a combat-focused party is a must, though the prevalence of traps and sorcerous opponents means you want to bring a thief and at least a couple of magic-users along as well.

The game is well-written, but compared to the other Infinity Engine games straightforward (indeed, somewhat refreshingly so at times). There's a few nice twists but generally what you see is what you get, and what you get is a metric ton of combat. You fight dozens of different types of enemies, from orcs to powerful enemy wizards, and amass vast quantities of loot. You also level up at a rate of knots compared to other D&D-based games. Generally speaking, if more than ten minutes go by without a ferocious combat sequence, something's gone wrong somewhere.

Luckily, Icewind Dale uses a later iteration of the Infinity Engine, with stronger graphics (including the heaven-sent ability to change the graphics resolution to something bearable on a modern PC), a friendlier interface and more options for character classes and combat (not to mention being able to carry lots more loot). In fact, if you ignore the simple fact that the game is 2D and sprite-based (there are 3D options for spell effects, but these tend to be hit and miss with modern graphics cards), it's aged very well indeed. The hand-painted environments are gorgeous, the sound and music is of a very high quality and the combat is fast and furious (though, as usual, you can hit space to pause the game at any time to issue fresh orders). The pace is only let down by the traditional D&D problem of having to rest every couple of fights to replenish spells, or having to quick-travel back to Kuldahar to unload the frankly ludicrous amounts of loot you amass on your quests at regular intervals. The game also ties in nicely (and unexpectedly) with the Icewind Dale trilogy of novels by R.A. Salvatore, despite taking place almost a century earlier (and fifteen years before Drizzt Do'Urden arrives in the area). This tie-in is very logical and satisfying, compared to the more obvious (and cheesy) cameos in the Baldur's Gate series.

The minuses are, for the most part, the obvious side-effects of the positives. Almost every situation in the game is solved by you hacking your way through it (though there are a few more original and interesting puzzles along the way), and overall the game lacks subtlety. The writing and moody black-and-white cut scenes are great, but given you spend a lot of time in combat-focused dungeons, some time can go by between plot-related events happening, which occasionally threatens to reduce the game to a hard grind. And, as great as the graphics are, the harsh snow backdrops and the very large creatures show up some issues with the engine, leading to some pixellation. The combat focus of the game also means it's pretty unforgiving and total party kills are not uncommon. As with all Infinity Engine games, but moreso here, you need to have a finger hovering over the quicksave button at almost all times and remember to save between combats, before resting, after resting, before tackling a complex trap (especially the ones which can backfire and blow up your entire party if you fail a roll) and at least every five minutes regardless of anything else.

That said, the game's not quite a brainless hack 'em up. The story, which it kicks in every now and then, is intriguing and the writing, when it does appear, is generally pretty good (as you'd expect from some of the same team behind Planescape: Torment). These elements give the game a bit more depth than its reputation suggests. In fact, if the game does suffer in departments, it's usually through comparisons to its contemporaries. Taken on its own merits and in isolation, a rewarding and impressive CRPG emerges.

Icewind Dale (****) is a fun, furious and enjoyable roleplaying game which has aged excellently, and is let down only in comparison to more story and roleplaying-focused RPGs. For those looking into a great dungeon-exploring or more action-based RPG, Icewind Dale more than satisfies.

Due to the game's age, there are a variety of ways of getting it. The Good Old Games edition may be preferable since it has been optimised to run on Windows 7 and Vista with no problems, and also includes the free expansion Trials of the Luremaster (which needs to be downloaded separately for the other editions). You can also get it as part of a triple-pack with the paid-for expansion, Heart of Winter, and Icewind Dale II (UK, USA) or as a boxed copy with just the expansion (UK, USA).",An enjoyable action-based RPG which has aged well,1309737600,2,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Design: Nothing too spectacular, looks good but not amazing in my opinion.

Overall: I mainly use this mouse for gaming. It's extremely comfortable, so if you're looking for just a daily usage or a light gaming (As in you don't game a lot) mouse I would highly recommend this if the price isn't too high. This mouse is fairly heavy, but to me that's not a con. I do love the way it feels and the weight of it compared to an extremely light mouse.

It has four programmable buttons on the side where your thumb rests, which is great. I pretty much use at least 2 of those buttons in every single game I play. The on the fly DPI switch is great too, very easy to change mid-game to your pre-defined settings. The actual Logitech Software is great too, never had any issues with that. You're able to customize your buttons and create macros from within there. This mouse also has an ""infinite"" scroll wheel option you can turn on or off with the click of a button. I really haven't found any personal use to this other than it just being a bit fun to spin!

My only real complaints about this mouse is the battery life is not the best, it may also be due to the fact that I'm still using the battery it came with. No problems plugging it in and playing at the same time though. Now I'm not just sure if this is me or if its the actual laser sensor on the mouse. While gaming, I notice that sometimes this mouse isn't the most accurate. Especially when ""Pixel peeking"" in FPS Games. I feel like the mouse jumps around a bit too much and skips pixels. It's hard to describe, but the best way I can say it is...Imagine your drawing a straight line and out of nowhere your pen skips that perfect straight line a bit. So in that end result, you have gaps in that line.

Other than those few issues, I absolutely love this mouse. It's extremely comfortable and the thumb rest on it is great.

That being said, I thought this was a terrific game. The graphics were nothing short of jaw dropping and the mechanics were very smooth. Some very good points I wanted to highlight:

1) The story:
Nothing fancy or too overblown so anyone can understand it. It only requires a very base knowledge of Resident Evil, and really holds it's own as a standalone tale. Also has a playable file called ""The History of Resident Evil"" which gives you a brief overview of all the previous game storylines in case you were confused as to the story or previous events.
You can get alot more out of it by watching the movie ""Resident Evil: Degeneration,"" as there are alot of references to previous corporations and ""Degeneration"" does well to sum it all up.

2) The Gameplay:
Much of the in-game mechanics are very smooth and the motion capture makes the characters have a very fluid appearance. None of the characters' actions seem joggy or forced, they all have a very ""human"" feel to them.
The quick equip weapons system makes it easy to interchange between firearms and exchange items between your characters.

3) The AI:
Vastly better than alot of the games out there. Not only are the zombies completely able to swarm your characters, alot of them are capable of flanking, piercing your defenses, or waiting for an open opportunity to strike.
Also this applies to your in-game partner, Sheva. The character isn't completely inept and really does help out the main character Chris.

4) The Co-op:
When playing with another person, it truly brings the gaming experience to a whole other level. The amount of teamwork involved in this game make it almost impossible not to have good communication with your partner.
That being said, the AI applied in the co-op is also helpful in that they obey your commands quickly and efficiently.
Another great point is that none of the co-op schemes are ""pre-destined"" in that many of the situations can be flipped to where either Sheva or Chris is in danger and one or the other needs to cover you.

5) The graphics:
As I said are nothing short of amazing. The level of clarity and detail included in the environments is beautiful and distinct. Not only that, but there are a vareity of environments to go through, so you can see the beauty of a dust covered African village, or the darkness of the wet marshlands.

Overall this is a very solid game. While many will cut it down in comparison to Resident Evil 4, from a new perspective, Resident Evil 5 does a great job.

Cut to you in the Fiction Fixer's office. You have been promoted from cadet (a trainee, as you were in ""Adventures in Wonderland"", the first Fiction Fixers game) to full-fledged Fiction Fixer. Your first assignment is to enter the book ""The Wizard of Oz"", and battle the Illiterati agent who has infiltrated the book and is changing the Land of Oz - for the worse.

Using your Fictionizer, you enter the book, to find yourself near a farm with a giant tornado coming towards you! You have your work cut out for you.

""The Curse of Oz"" is a combination hidden object (HO), adventure (point & click with inventory) and puzzle game. I counted 25 HO scenes. They are colorful and medium difficulty. There are 18 puzzles, which start out very very easy and then progress to medium difficulty. All are very colorful, with some repetition. There are many inventory actions, ranging from easy to medium difficulty. You are generally given clues in the dialogue for what to do next or what item your inventory is missing.

By itself, ""The Curse of Oz"" is fairly short. But this edition has a bonus of the first Fiction Fixer game, ""Adventures in Wonderland"", and it's mini-game, ""Hansel & Gretel"". That gives you more play time (though both of the two latter games are shorter than ""Curse of Oz""). ""Adventures in Wonderland"" has an additional 20 HO scenes and 25 puzzles, of the same difficulty as the main game. When you finish it, you unlock the mini-game, ""Hansel & Gretel"", with another 8 HO scenes and 2 puzzles.

From the main menu, you have access to a Strategy Guide, which, in additions to hints and skips, makes this a game appropriate for all ages and experience levels.

When you start the game, you select whether to play in Regular or Expert mode. Even in Expert mode, you can skip any puzzle and have unlimited hints that recharge fairly quickly.

""The Curse of Oz"" and ""Adventures in Wonderland"" load separately and can be deleted separately once you have finished. The first time I tried to load the game on my PC XP, it froze the computer and I had to shut it off, unplug it, and start again. The second time, everything worked fine. Once installed, you do not need the disc to play.

Gamezebo com rated ""Curse of Oz"" one of the Best Casual Game of 2010. And I can see why. The story line, with its tie-ins to the book, is a lot of fun and the whole game is colorful and fun to play. If you haven't read the book, I recommend it, for children or adults. The game, in little details, is faithful to the book, rather than the Judy Garland movie. For example, per the book, the magic slippers are silver rather than ruby. And one of the creatures encountered in the fearsome lion/bear-like Kalidah, which do not appear in the movie.

It's a very nice box, looks great on your shelf.

The art book is too small, I was let down. The art is great, but it's on tiny pages and half of the book has lore written in it. Less text, more art on bigger pages please.

The in-game cloak was cool at first but is a waste. The cloaks were originally decent at lower levels but the stats dropped. You will randomly get a cloak out of 3 possible options, adventuring, diplomacy or crafting. Overall the cloak was a let down like the art book.

The guild trophy, who the heck knows as it's barely getting added next week! Look at the date I wrote this and look at the date this game launched! Right now it's an ugly wooden trophy board that can't be dropped. It WILL have 3 different buffs, unlike the cloaks you are supposed to be able to choose which sphere the guild buff helps. It will be a small buff for all of your guildies that are online. It can go in a guild house, no guild HALL required. That's a good thing, guild halls are  a lot of work. I think this trophy might actually work out for us!

Trial keys...well the game was very unstable at launch so everyone I gave a buddy key to quit. I still have some saved, but they are working on a free trial now. It was never really worth it.

Three months of station access was cool. It lets you look at certain stats on their vgplayers site. It's cool, but the stats are often incorrect. In the end this isn't anything special. Another let down.

The audio CD is great, but there were more audio tracks released on fan sites pre-release that couldn't fit on the disc. Slightly let down by that, but it's a great CD! You'll like it!

Cloth map is cool, but it's stiff cloth with cheap print. It's not impressive, but it's cool to have. I've never used it for anything, but that's me. If you were hoping for an in-depth impressive cloth map you'll be let down by it, but it's still decent.

There's that old clich' that's always used, ""it's so real it's just like watching a movie,"" and that's usually not the case, not even close. Heavy Rain however, lives up to that, as this is as close to an interactive movie we've had in gaming. I guess to be completely accurate, I shouldn't say Heavy Rain resembles a movie as if graphically it's photo realistic and nearly indistinguishable from a movie (although what I said about facial animations still holds true). I guess it's like a movie in terms of characters, narrative, and cinematic storytelling.

This is pretty much the video game version of the Choose Your Own Adventure books. Despite what other reviewers may say, this is definitely a game of quick-time events, where you choose what happens next either by succeeding or failing at said event,  but it's done seamlessly and intuitively so as not to seem like a gimmick. I'm not the biggest fan of this type of gameplay, but what kept me intrigued was the story, which I felt was the strongest part of the game. I'm not a movie expert, but to me personally this game's story rivals the stories I've seen told in crime/mystery/drama type movies. All the characters had depth that made you care about them, and the way we go from controlling one of the four main characters to another is just like when a movie cuts from the main character to a secondary character in a different setting. I wanted to go forward to learn more, and as the game concluded, and we learned who the killer was, I was definitely surprised, but it made perfect sense. It was a motive you could believe in.  Everything fit together perfectly. Unlike a movie (or a dvd with no extra bonus features), this game has the advantage of having multiple endings, and by multiple, I'm talking double digits. But for me, once I got my one set of endings, I had NO inclination to play it again to explore other gameplay possibilities or endings. This was due to two main gameplay flaws that I was not about to subject myself to sit through again:

1) The walking controls are ridiculous. There is no reason why I should have to hold down R2 to walk. As it is, if you use the left analog stick without the R2 modifier, your character basically tilts their head in that direction, allowing you to sort of move the camera that way. No, THAT should be what the modifier does; Have the analog stick move you by default, and ONLY if you choose to want to look in a direction should you have to press R2. Think about it, at any given moment,  were you doing more walking or `head tilting' in the game? In fact, did you ever head tilt other than those few moments where you're prompted to by the game with that little circular motion thing telling you to search your surroundings? Maybe once or twice right? See my point?

2) Also, the walking is way too slow. It's too drawn out. I can't play through the whole game again with these slow motion walking characters. I realize this is probably a realistic pace to walk in, but since it's a game, they should've given me the option to run (how's that for the use of the R2 button eh?), or at least speed up the default walking speed. It feels like a chore to move from one spot to the next. Again, had they let you move with just the left analog stick, MAYBE this wouldn't have been as big of an issue (believe it or not, holding down R2 is actually fatiguing).

3) Ok, this one isn't so much a flaw as it is personal preference I guess. With the game's environments looking as great as it did, it sure would've been nice to be able to interact with it more. At any given point, you might be in a room with some of the most detail you've seen in a game, but unable to do anything with it other than doing that damn head tilt or switching between the two default cameras to see what else there is to look at. Generally speaking, some of the button prompts you get when you walk up to an object to interact with it isn't really even an interaction at all because it's not YOU doing it. Essentially, you're just triggering a cutscene by choosing to wash your face, or picking up that object off the ground.  What I would've loved to been able to do is switch to a first-person view and look around and have fun. All those fun environments to check out in first-person: the night club, the party mansion, hec, inside of the apartments. My guess on why you couldn't do this is because these are all pre-rendered scenes, and you're not really moving a character and exploring, so much as ""moving the picture to the left or right"" and seeing what else is on the canvas. With it being pre-rendered, the objects you want to examine in detail simply cannot be viewed from ""that angle,"" because there's no instance of it from that perspective. Hmmm...but then again you have those handful of levels where it's a third-person above the shoulder view, and it does feel like you have a free camera to rotate around and work with (like the police station).  Oh well, I can't explain it from a technical level, that's why I'm in school for game development :) All I know is that  these wonderful environments they created felt all too much like a movie since all I could do is WATCH IT.

Again, that third and final complaint I wouldn't defend too strongly, I concede that these types of gameplay mechanics could just be a function of the kind of game it is, and that me complaining about that is like complaining that a basketball game doesn't have enough Platforming elements to it. It is what it is. Had the controls not been flawed this game would've been amazing, and had tons of replay value. But even as it is, this is unique game with a deep, engaging story, and a perfect soundtrack.

There's nothing terribly wrong with Prototype, but there's nothing particularly amazing- so, I would normally  give it an average rating- 3 stars. However, the gameplay IS pretty fun, so I'm going to give it 4 stars.

Gameplay: What is there to say? You're a superpowered man who can eat people and disguise yourself as them, drive a ton of vehicles than can wreak havok, walk up the sides of buildings, and bash helicopters in with your bare hands. The game is quite fun to play.

Plot: With some ups and downs, Prototype's plot is pretty good. We have a formula that interests the viewer: You wake up with no recollection of what's happened, and you have all these strange abilities. The military is hunting you, and you need to survive while you find out the truth. The plot has cutscenes in which you're talking to a masked character, who is not revealed until later, as you ""recollect"" (play through) events. Combined with the amount of the plot that is gained on the side by finding ""web of intrigue"" targets and consunming them, you find out a lot without having it spoonfed to you. While it's not the quickest way to get a story told, it certainly is an interesting approach, and one that I enjoyed. Points to activision for that.
At the same time, some moments are predictable, and there are some plot points that are...the best way I can describe it is ""meh"". Still, I thought I knew who the final boss would be. I was wrong.

Video: Another area where Prototype has nothing flagrantly wrong, but nothing amazing. Prototype runs at 720P on either console (360 or PS3), it doesn't look bad, but if you look, you can tell. The graphics aren't superb or bad. Unlike inFAMOUS (which I bought at the same time), the city feels pretty generic and boxy. The game has some low quality textures at points, but it is respectable graphically throughout.

Audio: I don't currently have a surround sound system, so I can't speak for directional sound. The music of the game is pretty good, and the sound effects are decent. One particular criticism I have is that the voice acting is of VERY inconsistent quality- like they did everything in one take. There are some lines that are so poorly delivered you have to cringe. The script itself is not too bad though, and the web of intrigue scenes (many) have a ton of voices, so props on variety.

Controls: An area where I will give Prototype props.  The controls are pretty intuitive as a whole, which is great with the amount of havoc you wreak. You'd expect jumping up like Superman and hopping onto a helicopter, ripping the door off, and hijacking it to be hard, but the game does pretty well. It doesn't absolutely baby you, but it's intuitive (with the occasional inevitable bugs).

Length: There's a decent amount of side material and missions to add value to the game. Thankfully, they were able to do so without making the game feel artificially stretched out.

Overall: This game is fun to play, and it's pretty well priced. I can recommend it. It's not a legendary title, but it's a solid title by any means.","Pretty decent, but not all that memorable.",1257984000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

I haven't played too many basketball games since Super Nintendo, but I know quality when I see it and this game has an all around good feel to it. The controls allow for quick movement and slick ball control. The character movements and actions are among the best I've ever seen and give the game an extra realistic feel.

The graphics are so-so when I look at it on a whole with other next-gen console games. It also seemed like the higher I set the difficulty setting, the dumber and less talented my team would get. I'd miss multiple layups in a row and set an all time record for bricked dunks.

On top of that if I started getting a decent lead on the opposing team I seemed more prone to get foul calls from dumb teamates I couldn't control like 3 seconds in the paint or fouling a shooter outside the paint. I understand this makes the game harder but I don't think frustrating teamate A.I. is the answer.

Also I'll be the first to admit that I'm not crazy about rap but even somebody that loves to listen to it would tell you that the music is garbage. There's bad rap and then there's really really really bad rap.

Well basically you run from a killer with a giant pair of scissors which is scary thinking about it. EEK!! gives me the creeps... LOL anyway, the game is really scary especially since scissorman can jump out at any time and attack you. You either run away or hide somewhere to stop yourself from a horrible death. You try to figure out who this guy or what this thing is but now i know what it is... basically i thought at first it was professor barton and boy was i right...

Yet like every good game, all games have their pros and cons but the good news, this game only has two cons...

Pros: 1. The game is very freaky, do what i did, wait until ngith, close all windows in your room, your door, turn off the lights, and crank up the tv stereo. the music itself that plays when scissorman is near will make you jump out of your ksin literally....lol....

2. The game plot is very nicely done, it has very cool and unique characters and the scissorman is a very freaky character...

3. The environments are great, i love this freaking game!!!!

Cons: 1. Sometimes when scissorman jumps out, you sometimes don't really have any hiding places and have to run through ten million doors to find one...

2. Having to use a cursor instead of walking with the d pad, my cursor on the game sometimes screwed up and the character wouldnt run and she kept goign all over the place, i foudn out you have to click it a certain way but don't worry its easy, i was being stupid and not noticing it... lol....

I guess I was looking for some vast improvements in the series. I truly believe EA Sports had good intentions, but sometimes they are ahead of themselves. The first thing I noticed was that there was no Franchise Mode but it was there hidden under another name. I'm not going to elaborate on this year's Franchise Mode because every other review has done so. Anyway, I am writing this review because if you are a loyal Madden fan then no matter what EA does, we as fans will still buy and complain about everything that gets a change. One thing I realize as human beings we are not fans of change but we will complain and still love Madden 13. So this review is basically to say I love Madden no matter what, because despite the drastic changes it is still a fun game. It has however changed more to please more online players. I am still truly a Madden 12 fan, I wish I wasn't so eager to sell it for 13 but that is what loyalty does.

If you have Madden 12 and have not purchased 13 yet, it's not a rush to purchase, maybe savor 12 for a while longer and wait until 13 drops in price during the holiday season. All in all, people will complain about every little detail but at the end of the day they will adapt and adjust and keep playing until 13 Madden 14 comes out next year...

***One last thing, this year seems to be a lot more challenging, I was blown away at how challenging its become. I almost questioned my ability to play on All-Pro, it's a matter of adjusting to some of the technical game changes.

They can also be removed very easily should replacements ever be necessary. They do not use adhesive or anything caustic, instead they simply snap into place using the existing d-pad and a rubber lip around the bottom.

Actual use took some adjusting but once I grew accustomed to them they worked just as well as without.  My only complaint is that the physical size provides a few challenges.  Playing an FPS required a recalibration of muscle memory to correctly aim and move.  Also the extra height does make pressing the sticks down a bit of a challenge.  I imagine someone with smaller hands may not be able to push L3 and R3.

First off, I am tired of always feeling the need to be politically correct. With that said, MANHUNT is a breath of fresh (foul?) air in a genre that tends to be slightly different versions of the same old thing.

4.0,False,"03 16, 2011",A2KQDT7WF3ITP7,B0047TG2R0,Joseph Sayre,"Dragon Age, an RPG player's gorefest. The first DA created a massive world full of things you wanted to know about, interact with, and kill. The enemies were, i'll admit mildly generic, but they fit the theme of a swarming enemy using numbers to win battles as opposed to skill, so it was completely forgivable. The main issue DA has though is it drags, much like many RPG's the battle system is very easy to use, and account commands for. However, as all RPG's it simulates an actual battle about as well as chess does. The problem is in RPG's you get time to think, time to plan. In actual battles, you get none of that. Dragon Age I showed us that battles can be hectic and still be RPG-like, but its still very structurally slow, and often as long as you have a good enough healer, what you do doesn't matter. In addition, attacks which were rolled for would land even though they couldn't. The battle animation for Peon's Plight takes about a second, and the ogre it was hitting as far away from me by the time it landed, and well, he died. I was happy, but, it was weird.

Dragon Age II looks to improve the battle, while retaining the massive RPG elements that made the first one successful such as character building, stat based improvement of abilities, and an epic story that's immersive. But does the game actually live up to the hype behind it?

The Good:

A lot of Dragon Age 2's strengths are its weaknesses as well, don't be alarmed to see the exact same happy note as a negative note.

The battle system:

- The last battle system in dragon age more or less returns, the wheel is still here for the 360 and PS3 versions and it functions the same way. You still use the right trigger to toggle the 6 settable spells and can access the wheel using LT for more or abilities etc. Targets however have been changed up, you can no longer use abilities in battle unless they are in range, this can get odd when you go to use mighty blow and won't because you're a few too many degrees off the target, but it does keep you from wasting valuable mana or stamina, which is a plus. There were a lot of occasions when I'd use an ability in DA 1 and missed because the enemy wasn't quite in the arc of the attack I wanted to use, leaving me in cooldown and more vulnerable than i would have liked. The biggest change though is battle speed. During battle Hawke moves quickly, or very quickly depending on class. The rogue is a speed demon to make an understatement. Whats interesting I've found though, is that depending on your class is how you can fight effectively, mages and archers are good for support, mage nukes are good for crowds and warriors are generally good for crowds while still retaining sanity. The rogue seems best played as a one thing at a time type attacker. His speed will let him get away from most players but by micro managing his attacks to focus on one enemy at a time rather than gung-ho fighting, the rogue becomes much less of a crazy attacker.

= The thing though is that attacking is button mashed by A or X depending on console. Now there is nothing explicitly wrong with this, but it does get monotonous, still, often later in the game your mash will be less frequent as your move pool will keep you in your special techs more than simply mashing A.

Character Development:

- Characters in this game are MUCH more easily customized. Remember how Morrigan's shapeshifter tree blew? No problem now. Every character is capable of being customized to fit your needs. Want the knight you get early on to be a tank? set her up to do so, you can even change her equipment to suit the type of warrior you need her to be, easy stuff, and much better than the last game. In addition, levels seem to come faster in this game, you get levels much quicker in this title in the beginning.
The system to level up has been changed, not in actual premise, but in looks. Each class has a set of abilities, all viewable from the start and all possible of moving around in. However just like the last game, there are prerequisites to each ability in the trees, and there are level ones as well. Look them all over and do some planning on the character's first level up to get acquainted, try to figure out your play style, and plan accordingly.

- Dog is now a pet spell. Believe me, this is a good thing.

- As far as actual Hawke goes, Hawke's character is defined by the conversational choices you make, say something firm and your character's alignment to a more violent or serious character type increases. This effects things they say in battle and more. A sarcastic character will say different things in the beginning of and during a battle then a noble one will.

- Just like the last game, your conversational antics will shape your friends views of you, do things they like, you guys become friends, do things they don't and well, you can imagine. The games calls it rival, but i don't know if the member will simply leave like in origins if rivalry peaks.

- Lastly Your party members are not without voice in conversation, they can participate in conversation given the chance, and some of the time, they will be happy you asked them for advice. In DA 1 this was possible, but, well i won't spoil much, but you literally give them the torch and say ""do what you will"" on occasion, and they do, sometimes outright solving a problem rather than providing what they think.

Menu's:

- Overall the game's menu system is more streamlined, its much prettier and the level up method borrowed straight from Mass effect is welcome, any party members needing to level will be in here. Its a circle menu like Mass effect for everything else. If you're not familiar, when you pause, you use LS and A/X to select your choice, the menus are pretty easy to navigate this way.

-Your inventory is still the same, a list of items in regards to the items slot you're using is displayed and you can use X/Square to compare a new item with an equipped one and then choose with A/X or leave it set with B/Circle. L1/R1/LB/RB lets you cycle through characters on any submenu. Its easy to use once you get used to it.

- The biggest change however is the abilities, all abilities are set up in navigable trees, each tree can be individually selected and modified upon level up with points. All trees like DA 1 can be utilized cross subclass just like the first one. However on occasion it can be difficult to precisely select an ability that you wish to upgrade due to the controller input due to bad placing, when with a mouse it would be easy. Still, the abilities are much more easily understood at a glance. Diamonds are abilities, small icons are upgrades, and circles are Passive abilities. All in all though, the menu system used by MA works well, and I can't complain that its borrowed.

Graphics and animations

- DA 1 looks much more stiff than this game does, the faces in DA2 are more emotional, and the movements are much less action-figure like, they flow much more humanly (if not superhuman sometimes) and as a whole look more peoplelike.

-Speaking in game (lipsync) has gotten better as well, but it was quite good before, still it IS nice even that has improved. The loading screens are varied and pretty and overall the graphical quality has improved as well. Environments do look better.

- Armor types have improved as well, expect more armor skins and types in this one as well as weapon graphics.

- Elves, Darkspawn and Qunari all have updated facial and bodily features as well, each race now looks much more distinct than they did in DA.

- Character customization is much more extensive than in DA1, worth noting that there are about 20 or more hairstyles for both genders plus more of others.

The story:

- This game had me at the beginning, the voice acting is very very well done, and no character I've come across yet seems to have a bad voice actor. The story itself is the same brand as DA1 however, and having not completed the title, i'll have a hard time completely stating its a rehash, but then again RPG's don't typically offer up drastically different stories from one another in principle (become powerful beat boss, repeat) Bioware as always however, has a unique talent for making characters mke impressions, you'll have favorites and some things these characters go through or do will excite, appall, disgust, or even sadden you, and i couldn't ask for a more immersive experience there.

Dragon age 2 is not without fault however.

The battle system:

- Mashing A/X is a chore, especially with the rogue, continually mashing A gets to be annoying, and might make you frustrated. But again, it might happen less the more abilities you get.

- I still don't get why there isn't a RT activated 3 way replacement menu (3 spell replacement menu on cycle) so that you could have 9 total spells mapped to XYB by pressing RT once to switch to the next set of spells and using LT in conjnuction if you needed to change in a pinch. Still press RT once to change to next subset, and twice to get back. I use more than 6 spells/abilities, and it would have helped, but the Circle menu gets the job done.

- The main issue you might see though is the speed at which battles happen, frail characters can be overwhelmed and killed quickly, Hawke can become uncontrollable, and the battle system irritating until you really get a feel for it. But what bothers me is a lot of that 'RPG feel' is lost in the button mash, and essentially the game kind of turns into a hack n' slash dungeon crawler on the surface, but it does get harder and make you micro manage more as time goes on.

You either like this decision at core or not, and its game breaking depending on who you are, it may feel dumbed down, but in its defense, combat in DA1 was rather bland in execution, not the animations themselves though.

Talking:

- This is hit and miss with me, sometimes i want to take a particular route and the option to say whatever is there, but the actual statement isn't what i anticipated. This frustrates me, sometimes I pick a violent sounding response to have it come out as a cold response, or a matter-of-factly response rather than ""i want to slam your face into a wall with a nailbat nine times."" Its nitpicking but still.

Map:

- The only other real issue I have is the game's map. I liked the last games map, and this one just gets a bit, i don't want to say confusing, but its more complicated than needbe, and that said, its a bunch of arrows and boxes with Day Night and Mountain options. Still, i think i liked reading my quests, the way they they are set up in the this menu is kind of a to do list, and its a bit irritating, because you now have your quests on your map, but no info about them. Maybe i just haven't gotten used to it.

Overall, i think DA2 catches a lot of flak for pushing the game to seem more mainstream, just like Mass Effect did with 2, but honestly, the battle systems being more refined and more actiony typically add to immersion and cause more thinking on the fly. Still the tasks can be mundane this way causing massive horde killing like a action platformer, which occasionally happens. But Bioware games focus a lot on the equipment and stats, its more subtle, but it was very evident in ME and DA. DA2 gives me the ability to run away to heal much easier and to lure darkspawn into traps easier or funnel them. DA1 not so much as you can get hit by attacks based on attack chance rather than location.

DA2 is worth a look if you like RPG's or action games. Try the demo on PSN or Xbox live, it will give you a pretty good insight of what to expect, but, the game is much harder than the demo lets it on to be.

I'd like to give it a 4.5, but 4 will have to do. Its good, but that's not perfect.

**************UPDATE***********************************************************************

I have now beaten this game, and have decided to update my review. The rating still stays at 4 stars. The 3rd act is phenomenal in presentation. I was in awe, as all of the things reached a climax and what happens, simply happens. I expected something, but not what happened, and what DID happen was awesome, you'll have to play it.

But i do have some new things to review.

Dungeons: I am dead serious, about 95% of your quests return you to the same dungeon, a part of the same dungeon, or the same layout for a house or something similar. Every mansion is the same, every undercity is the same, every cave is the same, on one instance is it colored different, but its inexcusable for the lack of creativity in a game like this, even if they were lame or small, the identical dungeons are awful.
Even worse, this is coming from the company that baffled me with the amazing dungeons constructed for Origins and Awakening, and you do see that in the well, about 3 dungeons you visit over the course of about 100 sidequests. I have to admit, i was disappointed.

Updating the Button mashing, i hate it, i hate it, i hate it. Even as a warrior, it was monotonous, and though extremely useful at times, a button press once could have been used to lock on and auto attack an enemy until dead and tilt stick and attack to choose another target, I did NOT like spamming A, and it does not get better the more you play, you spam A like crazy with the occasional stop to drive your abilites and its usually a split second or a full second before you're back to button mashing. Not to mention, the animations, there are about 5 major looping standard attack animations, and being in control of them somehow made me notice it more. I felt more like Kratos than a general most of the time, i wasn't shouting orders i was an unstoppable monster of death. It didn't work for me, it was like God of War with RPG elements.

Weapons and armor: Ok, you cannot customize your friend's gear, you can't wear other class equipment, and often cannot use certain equipment due to stat allocation (magic for warrior) making 66% of the items you pick up or wish to buy in shops completely useless. I question why Bioware did not put a filter in the equipment obtainable. What i mean is, instead of having to accumulate a treasure trove of awesome mage wear as a warrior, why not simply only allow Warrior exclusive items such as plate or chainmail. Weapons, i Can understand since your allies can use them, but armor is exclusively for selling and aside from selling it for pretty much nothing, there is absolutely no hope it will be used or anything other than selling. So why include it? you already have a junk folder in your inventory, so why include yet more junk we can't use right there in the equipment?

I don't like the warrior 2 hander, he wings it around like a wiffle bat, it's ridiculous, the weapon has absolutely no illusion of weight at all, and it angers me, Origins showed the power of big weapons but though you hit like atlas, you barely moved, your attacks were slow, but worth it.

Spawn, I'm unsure what it is, but this game likes its waves. However units warp in, come out of nowhere, or jump from an obscene height to the ground. Its so unrealistic, and so action platformer.

Dragon age 2 is a RPG driven Beat Em Up like God of War or Splatterhouse, it's sad, but its true. It plays well and it has a good story, and as a standalone title, its very very good. However, as a Dragon Age sequel, its a failure. It lacks the inspiration the first game had, its down to earth nature, and its grand world, but retains Bioware's amazing storytelling.

It took several expansion packs to make Civilization 5 great. While the launch of SimCity was horrible, the servers have been better since. When I read about the issues in March, I waited about a week or two to go on. It was spotty at best but, after about a month, there were no issues connecting for me at all. Do I think the launch sucked? Yes. If anyone remembers way back when Ultima Online was available there were a million problems. It happens. Yes, at times I might get kicked off while playing but it usually happens once a month. Never in the afternoon but usually late at night. Do I think refunds were in order; absolutely not. The whiners and crybabies; Yes. Now, I'm not saying every 1-2 star reviews are the whiners and crybabies because I don't think this game was perfect. I'd say that the ones who didn't ""buy from Amazon,"" are pretty much the whiners stepping on their soapbox.

Concerning the DRM: It's a matter of opinion. I personally don't care that I have to be online to play SimCity. Many years ago, this would be a travesty but most people have connections that are on 24/7. I can sympathize though with people who either don't have a constant internet connection or live in a area with a slow connection. Not everyone has a Fiber Optic connection. My sympathy stops when you know full well that this game requires a internet connection to play, yet you still buy the game.

The graphics are pretty good. While the ""Sims"" seem more like stick figures, the buildings look especially nice. The skyscrapers look pretty. Not amazing, but pretty. The streets look nice as well however, sometimes there is a glitch when you place roads, it will sometimes place a intersection that doesn't belong or show a pathway right into a home. I wish that the traffic lights could of been more realistic but I really like how in this SimCity, the driving Sims really pay attention to the traffic lights although pedestrians don't which looks unrealistic. Also, the city looks alive with your citizens going about there business. For example, a homeowner within your city drives to the Garbage Dump, reports to work and is driving a garbage truck to pick up the days garbage. I love how the trucks go to each and every zone to pick up the trash. The simulation does a fine job letting you know whether you need to plop more buildings to add more garbage trucks. The idea of ploppables is fantastic!

In all honesty, I don't miss the terraforming and region creation tools from SimCity 4. Yes, I believe in this SimCity that there should be more of a variety of regions. Right now there are only a handful that allows you to have up to 16 cities and several ""Great Works."" Great Works act as huge bonuses to your region. For example, if your region cooperates and builds a International Airport, citizens from your whole region, even if they aren't connected to all 16 cities, can visit any city within the region. You also can get a huge influx of tourists. If you built a city catering to tourists, then this means more money in your coffers. Some cities have rivers running through it, some cities have a ocean bordering it. While this does help your sims in the way of commuting to other cites, tourists visiting, and relieve traffic, this does take away valuable real estate to build on a already midsized map. Still, some variety on the actual plot of land you chose to build your city is needed.

Concerning city size maps, yes, I do believe they are not large. Gone are they days where in SimCity 4 you can create a city with millions. While it's possible to create a city with 1 million people, all cities will look the same cramming people within city block after city block. In my honest opinion, if I created a city with millions in SimCity 4, the city seemed to have no heart and no specialization. Yes, I could add a mall, prison, missile silo, and a toxic waste dump but the simulation was not realistic. While at times I will think, ""hey, a bigger map would be nice,"" but thinking about it, Id rather be able to specialize my city than them all looking the same. Playing SC4; the cities and region looked the same. You could put everything down and not have to worry about the budget. The one thing I do miss from SC4 was creating a giant region. It would of been nice if the regions in SimCity allowed for more cities. The cap is 16 so far.

Concerning multiplayer, Cities XL failed but with SimCity, it's pretty nice. If someone needed money or municipal help, help was on the way. In Cities XL, you had to pay $9.99 for the multiplayer aspect, but on SimCity, it's free. Communicating and trading is much easier on SimCity than CXL. Just remember that the multiplayer aspect on CXL was shutdown years ago. Focus Home Entertaining who bought CXL from Monte Cristo hasn't done much with the several additions to CXL. The most was the ability to mod. Those that want to complain about Maxis/EA should look at Focus Home Entertainment. They re-released CXL as CXL '11 with adding a good amount from CXL '09 (Monte Cristo) but the same old bugs that plagued CXL '09 were carried over. The game once again became unplayable if you had several hundred thousand citizens. Subsequent releases of CXL just added some buildings but again, the same bugs carried over. How can you justify a $29-39 game adding maybe 100 buildings each year but the same old bugs infest it. FHE takes forever to answer you if you have a problem and yet again, CXL Platinum is pretty much the same as the other CXL iterations.

Going back to SimCity, now you can specialize your city. You can craft a mining town, a resort catering to tourists, a technological center that creates flat panel TV's and CPUs, and a cultural mecca that includes stadiums, arenas, and a amusement park (DLC). Your decisions affect who comes to your city whether it's tourists or other workers from other cities within your region. This can also create traffic nightmares. You have several traffic solutions to work with although I was slightly upset that if I create a huge city, I couldn't create a subway. With the city land size not great, at least give me the option of creating subway lines. The one thing that CXL excelled at, the ability to create ""lines."" For example, bus lines and subway lines. You can't create bus lines in SimCity but you have the option to place Bus Terminals, a shuttle depot and/or a bus depot. If your Bus Terminal has a long wait time, you can add more buses to your terminal in the form of ploppables which is a great idea. The idea of Ploppables allows you to add to a building instead of building more and more of the same type. For example, if you build a Coal Power Station and you find that you need more power, instead of building another Coal Power Plant, you have several options to add to your power plant. In SimCity 4, it wasn't uncommon to have a dozen coal power plants in your city which was a pollution nightmare. In this SimCity, besides pollution, you have to take into account which way the wind is blowing plus you can add clean burning coal furnace ploppable if you have the necessary ""research,"" from a university within your region.

The simulation is very nice. When your garbage trucks drive around in SimCity 4, all they do is drive around. In SimCity,they will drive around to all zones, stop, pick up the trash, and move to the next zone. The simulator does a really good job showing you different charts/graphs from garbage, coal deposits, happy Sims, crime, pollution etc. How the zones ""communicate"" with each other is great. Your sims will look for work. They will mostly look for work within your industrial zones as well as commercial. The amount of workers varies for each zone type (C/I). Even your trade depot which sends out trucks to your industrial zones and mining complexes to bring back to the trade depot to ship out your freight from your industry and sell or buy your ore, coal, and/or oil. Within your industrial complex at your trade depot, you can buy/sell alloy to create TVs and CPUs to sell for a lot of dough!

Many have opinions but personally I don't mind about the always on component of the game. My internet is on 24/7 and rarely does Verizon cause a hiccup. If the server is down or if my internet is down, then I'll just simply play another game. Will I get annoyed? Of course but hey, I got other games. Origin which is where this game is located (like Steam) I find is not as good as Steam but I've never had any hiccups with Origin.  I've never had that issue and I will go on SimCity any time during the day and/or night. I usually encounter the ""server not responding"" when I'm playing at night but it has been a very long time since I got that error message. The last 2 times I was thrown out of my city was because Verizon was shooting updates. It happened late last night; I called Verizon and they said that there was a update that was sent. When my internet was back, I found that my city was still there, saved, and had everything I did that day for the few hours I was on. While I didn't exit SimCity and see it sync and save, it still showed everything was there.

Yes, it seems that SimCity is adding DLC to pay for but who hasn't been doing this. Tropico 4 just added more content that you need to pay for. Look at Train Simulator 2013, it has over $1000 worth of DLC. I hope SimCity does get expansion packs. SimCity 4 was great with the addition of the Rush Hour expansion pack. Yes,  Do I hope SimCity's maps get bigger? Yes. I do find SimCity enjoyable. Not quite up there with SC4 but I would rate it higher than CXL at this point. For those that will bug out with my 4 star rating, get over it. I happen to enjoy SimCity. Feel free to argue your points in the comments but at least keep it civil. My opinion,  I don't need comments telling me to go f- myself just because it's my opinion. Show some class.

Concerning the DLC (downloaded content) of European City packs; what's the big deal? Personally, Im glad it wasn't included within the limited version since I wouldn't even use it. This was why I changed my order to the Limited version. For those that wanted it, they had the other edition that was $70. Those that complained about paying $70, then you should of gotten the Limited Edition. Having available as DLC just means that if you change your mind, buy what you want. Same thing with the new Amusement Park DLC. If you don't like it or question EA concerning it; again, don't buy it, it's your choice. Spamming us with DLC is nothing new. A majority of games other than SimCity have been (and still are) doing it. Buy what you want; pass on what you don't want. It's funny because then you get the whiners who say,"" I don't want this crap in my game.""

People really need to stop whining about ""bigger maps, it's SimTown, the server issues, why did I buy this, I wasted $70."" I know growing up is hard to do as accepting the fact that there are people that actually enjoy the game. While the game is not perfect, it's much better than what it was at release time.

+ FREE multiplayer
+ Nice fresh graphics that really update the SimCity series
+ The simulation is very nice (If you build a hotel and gambling casino for tourists, by placing commercial zones nearby, you'll see motels/hotels and shopping pop up and tourists will go there
+ Glassbox Engine looks good
+ Specialized cities
+ The bus stops plop ON the road like it should unlike SC4 that took valuable real estate (2 tiles)
+ YOU HAVE TO THINK AND PLAN AHEAD; put into thought what you want since the saving option was taken away

- Maps aren't very big
- Highway placing (parkways) taken away...in other words, we have no control and/or placement of limited access highways. Which is a bummer, I miss toll plazas :)
- Wish we had more hotels and casinos or resorts to place in our tourist specialized city
- The road placement tool is a little awkward
- Server illness sometimes happens (it throws you off) but honestly, since I've had SimCity (since day 1) I've only been thrown off 4 times and that's mostly since June.
- Origin (I find Steam slightly more reliable BUT when Steam has those 75% sales, you will be happy that SimCity is on Origin.
- Not enough region variety
- The city sites in the region look the same for each ""resource type""
- The pathfinding for the firetrucks/police vehicles/ ambulance is baffling which was fixed in a patch

***By the way, the Prima Guide is very informative. You can also get it online and it will update according to the game****
*** The embellishment of constant server bugs is more from people who jump on the anti-EA/Maxis train and follow others.***

4.0,False,"07 23, 2009",A3ALLLC2FXZ134,B001COVME6,Halicon5,"Little King's Story is a cutesy Real Time Strategy (RTS), Role-Playing (RPG), simulation, and action title that definitely stands out from the pack.  Aside from some strange design decisions and a few graphical flaws, this is a shining example of an original idea that I hope to see grow into its own franchise.  Fans of the Harvest Moon/Rune Factory series as well as fans of Overlord and Pikmin will probably immediately recognize the influences in Little King's Story.

PROS:
+++ Original gameplay that blends a variety of genres
+++ Creative and colorful graphical design
+++ Clever and interesting enemies, bosses, characters, and townsfolk bring the game to life.

CONS:
--- This game should have used pointer controls similar to Pikmin New Play Control.
--- The blur filter on the graphics is extremely over-used
--- The game gets off to a pretty slow start for the first hour

GAMEPLAY:  Very, very awesome.  Role-playing, city building (but not planning), exploration, lite resource management, and total subjegation of your loyal subjects.  It's a good package.  Basically, you play the role of a young child who gets whisked away to a magical world where he becomes King.  Specifically a King with a bent towards world domination.  Despite the cutesy presentation, the Little King is actually a bit of a tyrant and dictator.  There is definitely no democracy to be found.  I certainly wouldn't want to live in this country that I'm running, but I'm having fun running it.  You bend the citizens to your will, ordering them to do whatever you wish, be it farming, digging holes, or even charging to their untimely doom while battling a cow.  You can wander around with a gang of citizens and soldiers, gathering taxes from the homes of others or raid and pillage other countries (7 in total).  If you have shiftless, layabout unemployed people, you can force them to get jobs, whether or not they like it.  All the while you are exploring the countryside and building a small nation.  Although the game has a plot, you are basically allowed to proceed at your own pace, which really allows for multiple play styles.  Throughout the game you also get the opportunity to participate in little mini-quests and objectives to keep your populace (and princesses) happy.

Similar to Pikmin, combat relies very heavily upon using your companions.  You can choose to attack using Little King, but your loyal subjects make much better soldiers and cannon fodder.  Some citizens can perform special functions, such as farmers, carpenters, merchants, and lumberjacks, while the combat focused units are a bit more obvious.  Different enemies are weak against different types of citizens, so planning your raiding party in advance is critical to your success, although mobbing and swarming enemies is frequently an effective yet crude tactic.  Throughout the game you gain frequent opportunities to increase the size of your kingdom, purchase upgrades, new buildings, and equip your citizens with different items and artifacts.  Despite the game's kiddie look and storybook presentation, this one is a deep, deep game that keeps growing on me the more I play it.

CONTROLS: Good, but they could have been better.  For a game that is very clearly inspired by the Pikmin series, the controls feel archaic.  Moving from the slick and neatly improved controls of the Wii re-release of Pikmin to Little King's Story is a rough transition.  It isn't that the controls don't work, but the complete lack of pointer control seems like an oversight.  Because of this issue the process of selecting and directing units in combat feels a little clumsy.  The camera feels a little to claustrophobic and close as well.  Honestly, if the controls were better this game would immediately jump to 5 star ranking since the controls are the only thing holding this game back from its fullest potential.  Luckily there are some upgrades that you can unlock that make navigating your units through the world much easier, such as the defensive and evasion formations.  I really would have preferred that the squad formation controls to be available from the moment you start the game instead of having to purchase an upgrade, but once I took over the first kingdom of the Onii, my complaints about navigating the world really became moot.

GRAPHICS: Good and bad.  The art style is cookie cutter cute.  Brilliant design and beautiful color palettes bring the game to life.  The whole world is animated, down to the trees and flowers.  Cut scenes are particularly striking and look like an animated children's book.  Simply amazing.  Unfortunately, many of the in-game textures are very low res, which combined with the overuse of a blur/brush filter tends to mar the otherwise beautiful designs.  The in-game graphics never get in the way of enjoying the game, but they really could have been a lot crisper.

SOUND: Good, but not original.  The voice acting is somewhere between ""so-so"" and ""good"" and consists of structured gibberish sounds, similar to games like Banjo-Kazooie.  Some people will find the voice acting cute and charming, others will find it annoying.  The music is public domain classical and arranged quite nicely with a nice mix of classical, romantic, and baroque period pieces.  I really feel that the music fits the game perfectly, although some original tunes would have been nice to see as well.

VALUE: This game is going to take most people quite a while to beat.  My current estimate is about 20 hours, give or take.  There doesn't seem to be any one ""right"" way to play the game.  The open and relaxed approach to progress means you can take the game at the pace you prefer.  While no where near as addictive as Rune Factory, the game will probably keep you coming back for more.  The constant minor upgrades to your kingdom definitely keep me going and I frequently found myself saying ""I'll conquer just one more section of the map...."" until far too late into the night.

Some people may be turned off by the cutesy look of this title and the lower resolution graphics, and I can't blame them, but they will be missing out on a great little game that is unique to the Wii.  I already hope a sequel is planned for this game and I really hope that it will address some of my complaints about the controls, because this game truly screams for pointer control.  Young children may struggle with this title as it is quite complex and the controls aren't as intuitive as they could have been.  Even with these issues I definitely recommend this title as a purchase for most gamers, especially fans of the Pikmin, Overlord, Rune Factory, or Harvest Moon games.",This Little King is wee bit of a Tyrant,1248307200,69,,

4.0,False,"06 28, 2014",A2NOJVQUPKPTEI,B00BI83EVU,R. Pickman,"Watch Dogs is an interesting experience. It's one part Assassin's Creed, one part Grand Theft Auto and a dash of Orwell's 1984.

The premise is that it's Chicago in the very near future (like 5 years) and you are a hacker. Smart phone technology has allowed the devices to become the hacker's tool of the trade. You're part of a two man team that goes into crowded upper class areas (Hotels, Restaurants, etc) and hack people's phones and drain their bank account into your own. One of your jobs goes awry and an unknown malcontent decides to teach you a lesson resulting in your niece being killed. You could grieve and give up your life of crime, but that's not your style. Revenge is on the menu and you're serving it cold.

Aesthetically and mechanically Watch Dogs is primarily GTA. The whole of Chicago is your playground. You can steal cars and drive them, missions frequently involve evading police. Based on your crimes the police up their force to pursue you. You can kill anyone, etc. There are no prostitutes, at least none that I have found. I always thought that was stupid and gimmicky anyway, so no love lost there.

Several things have been taken from Assassin's Creed as well. Free run and climbing is here. Although you can't climb everything like you can in AC, which makes sense, you're a hacker not an assassin. Walking around you are able to listen in on people's conversations (which often lead to side missions) and drain their bank accounts, very similar to some of the open world mechanics in AC. You can buy better equipment and use it via the weapon wheel like in AC. Even crafting grenades and other tactical devices. You have to hack these communications towers and that's what shows you where all the side quests and missions are, much like climbing the towers in AC.

Side missions include VR mini games, running down gangs that are on their way to kill someone and stopping them before they do so, tailing criminals and stopping their crimes before they hurt anyone etc. They're fun albeit a little repetitive. You're generally well rewarded with positive reputation, money and exp. If nothing else they break up the gameplay.

Watch Dogs includes several RPG elements. Most things grant you experience points. If you evade the police, you get experience. If you successfully hack something you get experience. Thwart a crime, experience. Kill a gang member with a well-placed headshot, experience. When your experience bar is full you are awarded a single skill point. You don't gain levels and I believe that the experience bar always takes the same amount to fill. Skill points are used to buy, you guessed it, skills. You have several skill trees; hacking, driving, combat, etc. Like a standard RPG you buy skills with skill points and certain skills have various requirements to unlock (your game progression, previous skills, etc). There are a lot of skills that are very useful and I'm pretty sure if you put in the time, you can unlock every single skill.

You collect money from quest/mission rewards and from draining bank accounts. Money buys better weapons, ammo, new outfits, new cars (cars can be summoned virtually anywhere as long as you own them), etc. The outfits are kinda cool and allow you to give your character a look that you prefer. Most are essentially what he's wearing on the cover in different colors and patterns.

The vehicle system is very helpful because Chicago is BIG. You can steal a car, but the alarm may go off, or someone may call 911 earning you unwanted attention. You also have a phone app that allows you to order one of the cars in your inventory from a friend who knows a guy who will park your vehicle of choice a block away from you. Every time you steal a different kind of car it will show up in this inventory. The standard low-end cars are free from the get go, the better cars cost an initial fee to fully unlock. There are A LOT of cars. Armored cars, semis, sport bikes, Ferrari's, Volkswagen, Lancers, station wagons and the list goes on. PLENTY to work with. Each handle differently and have different durability. Obviously a fiberglass sports car is going to explode faster than an armored truck.

Let's discuss combat. As I stated you have an array of weapons. Hand guns, shotguns, sniper rifle, frag grenades, signal jammers, assault rifles. You can buy them or pick them up off dead bodies. Obviously some are better than others. This works well as you can approach each situation differently. So many things can be hacked. You can daisy chain hack cameras, quickly identifying where all the enemies in the area are. Scanning them will tell you things like whether or not they'll call for backup, if they have any explosives on them, etc. You can overload circuits causing things to explode, usually killing those nearby or at least getting their attention. You can burn them by releasing steam valves. If they have grenades you can remotely detonate them. I like hanging out outside a compound and using the above mentioned tactics to kill off most of the enemies and then sneak in using the silenced pistol and sniper rifle to clean up the rest. BUT you could use a semi or armored car to blow through the front gates and hop out with your shotgun and grenade launcher an turn the place into an inferno. The choice is yours! Combat works very well as a third person shooter, I have absolutely no complaints.

Missions are put in categories by type and you have a progress wheel, much like the memory sync strands in AC that let you know how many of a specific mission you have done and how many you have left. It's a great system for the completionist.

Graphics are fantastic. They really pushed it with this one. Sound is well done, but Ubisoft has always done well with sound. The soundtrack is phenomenal, a lot of Chicago bands. Ubisoft did such an amazing job recreating Chicago. I can't stress this enough. I live in Chicago and it's a very strange experience driving on streets in the game that I do in real life.

My ONLY complaint is the same as I have with GTA. This is really just a matter of opinion and preference. I feel like the sandbox world is stronger than the overall story. I find myself frequently putting off the story so I can try different things in the open world environment. This may change as I get further into the story AND, from what I've played of the story missions, they're much stronger than anything Rockstar has every put out. Yes, I know Rockstar doesn't try to focus on the story, it wasn't a dig at them. You do feel for the protagonist and the situation he's in. I just feel that the story doesn't pull you in from the get go as much as it should. Overall though, it's a phenomenal title and Ubisoft has done an amazing job at combing elements from several successful genres into a single, solid title. If you're on the fence about this one, don't be, it's definitely worth your time.",Assassin's Creed + GTA + 1984 = Watch Dogs,1403913600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Plot: The plot of the game follows the Adventure Time universe where Finn and Jake are sent to find three missing princesses in the Nameless Kingdom. It follows along in story a lot like the show it is derived from and there are multiple appearances from the tv show along with some new characters. Adventure Time fans will have a lot of enjoyment out of this and even I who had not watched Adventure Time yet enjoyed the overall premise of the game. I was not lost at any point in the story and I appreciate that people who don't watch the show can pick it up and play it .

Another perk for fans is that the voice actors who voice the characters in the show actually provide the in game character voices for Finn, Jake, etc. This is always pleasant because most often than not, video game adaptations of movies and tv shows hire new voice actors who do a less than stellar performance.
_________

Gameplay Experience: The artwork and play scheme of the game reminds me a lot of a clash between bowser's inside story and the Legend of Zelda. In fact, this game is not just for Adventure Time fans, but for Zelda fans as well. There are a lot of references to the Legend Of Zelda like the opening stage where you have to get into the castle through a secret passageway located at the woods in the side of the castle. The game plays a lot like Zelda following its top down gameplay with the hacking and slashing of monsters. There are vast dungeons with tons of mind breaking puzzles to go through.

I must warn you that the difficulty of this game is hard. I died multiple times in the game and I am pretty sure kids will even have a harder time going through certain levels. Also, this game seems to have no mercy on you. Some parts are incredibly difficult or there's a puzzle that I can't seem to figure out but the game does not offer any type of hint at all. Certain dungeon levels are huge but it seems like a lot of cut and paste so it all looks the same resulting in me getting lost numerous times and having to back track( Not fun at all).

Conclusion: This game is fun but it does have its setbacks. It is difficult and for gamers who are experience with top down games and will be a joy to Zelda and Adventure time fans.

4.0,False,"06 9, 2011",A2YYJWJ2DEABJ7,B0045U4U52,D. B.,"Initially, I wasn't sure about this game. Everybody said the story was awful, the gameplay was rough, and that the main character was just annoying. Mostly, I disagree.

For me, I've always been interested in the Parasite Eve games, but I had never had an opportunity to play them. From the research I did when I was interested in the PSX games, I understand that this story has nothing to do with the previous Parasite Eve games. I don't even know who all of the Cameo characters are supposed to be in relationship to Aya. This is the first time that I met them.

From the get-go, I was very impressed with the game. I actually felt like the controls were sufficient and the gameplay was very fun. In the grand scheme of things, the gameplay is probably really repetitive. It actually doesn't feel that way. That's probably because the environments are constantly changing and the enemies are differing slightly as you go. One big issue people have had with this game is the difficulty. I saw those complaints and decided this game should be one I start out on Easy. This was a good idea. In that mode, it was still challenging but I didn't feel like I was going to get a migraine because of it.

The story is actually very interesting to me. It's based around this invasion of creatures called the Twisted. They emerged from beneath the Earth and popped up everywhere across the globe. Aya was found shot, covered in blood, and in a wedding dress around the same time that the Twisted emerged. They find out that she has the ability to send her Psyche into other people and can use their bodies. They then create a machine that can send her Psyche into the past.

That's about the gist of the beginning. There are only 6 episodes in the game, and playing through them takes about an hour long. I think it's the first 3 chapters that you play in the past, then you play in the present (2013) for the last 3, with a little more time in the past in a bit of the last chapter.

In the first three chapters, the given circumstances of the timeline are completely changed. Something significant is completely changed from the last chapter. That was really fun to try to keep up with. It was also incredible to receive the story. The cutscenes were just awesome. There was a lot of detail, the occasional weird line of text, and new questions for you as you go along. It feels more like an action-mystery game than say, a survival horror. In fact, it never feels like a survival horror. It rarely attempts to be creepy because in the time or two that they do, it doesn't pan out. Actually the creepiest part of playing the game was listening to awkward Maeda. He's a stuttering Japanese man who seems nervous, but not too nervous to talk to Aya like she's some object.

A lot of people say that Aya is whiny and weak-willed. I disagree. I believe that she wanted to help people out, and then I believed that her reason for going out there was because she needs to find out who she is, and she just so happens to find out more and more as she engages with the Twisted. I thought of Aya as a caring individual who would fight to protect others.

Unfortunately, she's highly sexualized. As you play, her clothes rip more and more until she's left with scraps. Yeah, her butt-cheek will be visible. It's a bad idea because this is a PSP game. While their graphics were awesome, you'll never be able to make people appreciate the sexiness of your three-dimensional sprite.

Then there will be plot-twists that are just dumb. Actually, I was okay with the plot twists as the story went along, but I hated the end scene. Everything is perfectly shaped to fit together into the story until the end when they explain how the twisted were created, how Aya lost her memory, and how to change the past to save the future. Well they forgot to answer one glaring question: that of the true catalyst that started the whole continuity of the game. Why did the officers in uniform EVER show up and start shooting? If you have the opportunity to play this game, please ask yourself that. There was no explained reason, no previous tiff, no Kill Bill assassination for running away. The officers just shoot. And if you were to try to explain it from the information they give you, it won't be logical. So something that seemed incredibly intelligent and put together makes a wreck of itself in the last ten minutes. I've never been so appalled by the ending of a story before. I hated making myself sit through the end credits.

Luckily, most of the story is appetizing. Gameplay is augmented by what is called DNA boards and weapon customization. Both are great concepts and feel very simple to understand, but they do have their short-comings. The DNA board doesn't have a tutorial, but you can actually unlock more abilities for Aya by playing around with it. It was kind of fun trying to fit things in like a puzzle so I could strengthen my character. It got a whole lot less fun when I realized I had spent ten minutes on just a couple nodes, re-trying the combinations so the nodes would be a higher level. Right before working on the other nodes.

Weapon customization is fun the first couple times you open the menu, but quickly gets disappointing and frustrating. The controls or layout of how you choose your weapons and how you customize them just don't feel right. It feels like a lot of work trying to gather a lot of information from a lot of different places. The other frustrating thing is that there are so many weapons in the game, but you'll only unlock maybe a fifth of them in your first playthrough. On top of that, each customization costs money, and a lot of it. Each weapon can be customized with anywhere from 8-20 pieces. The first pieces cost say 1000 BP. Then the second row of pieces costs 2000-4000 BP. So to fully customize each piece, you must unlock them through hours of gameplay, unlock the customization, and then spend 15-30,000 BP on each weapon. You earn about 8,000-12,000 in an hour of gameplay. The cost is SO high that you end up focusing on only a couple of weapons for the run-through, and then the weapons stop doing nearly enough damage.

I wish they could have come up with simpler ways to handle those two elements because I ended up spending a VERY significant amount of my time in these two menus rather than in the gameplay they were supposed to augment.

The other thing I want to mention is that the difficulty really comes from the controls in certain situations. The majority of the game, you automatically lock onto an enemy with the L button. When you snipe, or grenade launch, or tank, suddenly all of your movement is taken away. Aiming with a sniper is AWFUL. The crosshairs move so slowly that it feels ridiculous trying to ever hit the target. Which is weird because the game encourages sniper usage in so many places. If you use the sniper, you can hit weak spots which cause massive damage. Also, the bestiary tells you where the weak spots are. This is all well and good, but the crosshairs move really slowly while the enemy is moving fairly quickly. You also only have about 10 shots. When you try to snipe, you'll almost never hit the weak spot, and then you're a sitting duck while the twisted comes and knocks you on your back which, by the way, resets the crosshairs, so you have to do all of that searching all over again.

Well, I'm the kind of person who can talk about how bad things are very easily, but talking about the good doesn't happen quite as easily. This game I played almost non-stop for two days straight. I hated the ending, but went right back in and played for another two hours. The gameplay was so fun, that I don't know if I've ever been so enthralled by a game. Also, the graphics are extremely fantastic. The game has great strengths and great weaknesses. It's too bad that they couldn't have made this a true continuation of the previous two games in the series for those of us who might have been interested in seeking out the old games as well as for the fans. An oversexualized game like this feels like fan-service, but it's really doing your fans disservice by not honoring the continuity of the previous entries in a series. By the way, Square-Enix, half of your games feel like carbon copies of each other, and the other half, your name was Squaresoft. I'm really starting to think that Square-Enix has not in recent years been truly deserving of the praise they hold.

I can also tell you that where they ended it the first time through pretty much guarantees that there won't be a number 4. Bummer.",Following the Reviews Wasn't Necessarily True,1307577600,7,,

I say the power button isn't wide enough, because i pretty much need a fingernail long enough to put enough pressure on the button. As for the Cartridge slot, I decided to bring it to work after i eye-balled and marked up where the slot sits when the 3DS is installed. Asked a coworker to cut the section I marked off out, and save me the little locking clip on the upper edge. He did as I asked which was great. I sanded down the new opening, and filled the gap in the plastic with silicone/RTV. then carefully sanded down the very edge of where I re-positioned the clip to hold the 3DS in the handle-grip, and used a small bead of MEK glue and let it sit for a bit for the small clip to take hold.

My suggestion is turn on the Japanese language and turn on the subtitles and enjoy the game that way. Yes, you will actually have to pay attention to the story but the Japanese VA's are just so much better. (For me I prefer Sub over Dub)

So I was pretty disappointed when other than deciding on your character's appearance and clothes, the game is nothing like the The Sims at all.  It's more like an action/adventure/puzzler type of game.  The premise is your Sim's car breaks down in Strangetown, a Roswell type village in the middle of the desert, and since the locals think you have nothing else better to do with your time, they recruit you to run their hotel.  After that, you're sent on various missions, like getting building permits, finding certain items, cheering people up, fighting off aliens with water guns, etc.  Unlike the regular Sims game, there are very few things that are customizable.  The only thing I give credit for is that the creators of the games were awfully creative when designing their scenarios.  Either that, or they were ingesting/smoking some illegal substance.  Still, I'll give them kudos to that.

Even though I personally was disappointed in the game, my daughter loves it.  She told me that it was better than Kirby Superstar Ultra, which is saying something, because she adores Kirby.

My husband has played The Sims 2 on DS and he liked it a lot too, though he told me it's boring after you have done all the missions and just have to run the hotel.  Neither he or my daughter have played The Sims PC game, so they have nothing to compare it to.

So, in short, if you're looking for a mini version of The Sims PC game, this isn't it.  But if you like weird fun games that send you on various missions, you probably will enjoy it.","Not Like The Sims on PC, but fun for a video game.",1232668800,,,

If I want to play Phantasy Star4, I need a Sega Genesis.  But in this case, with the Dreamcast consoles' production be halted and for a rather low price (not necessarily through Amazon), it's quite a deal.
The games that I have look very good.  I have found that the Sega products tend to keep a more 'cartoony' style while the PS2 is desperately trying to get the characters to look more human.  (Well, humanoid.  Only Square can do it best...)  I don't have many and that brings up the next case.
Sega honestly doesn't have any games that I really want to play.  Even when first coming out over a year ago, there were few games that really caught my eye.  Carrier was one of them because I thought the premise was better than the Resident Evil games (which I don't care for...).  I needed a fighter and Streetfighter fulfills that.  I have DOA2 on the way, but the game that made me buy the DC was Phantasy Star On-Line.

""The Punisher"" is now available for the PS2 (there are also X-Box and PC versions available), and I can honestly say that they have finally come out with a superb vision of the dark and brutal world of this cold-blooded antihero.  It's violent.  It's disturbing.  It's unsettling.  It's intense.

As it should be.

You're Frank Castle, a.k.a. ""The Punisher.""  You have cemented yourself in a life of violence as you plead to punish the guilty since the judicial system does not.  The story in the game is that you have been picked up by the police and they are now questioning you about a number of ""assaults"" carried out by you.  You relive those flashbacks and gun down criminals left and right while trying to find out who is the mastermind behind the sudden crime wave (not to mention the number of attempts on your life).  Your gut says it's Kingpin, but evidence points elsewhere.  It's up to you to find out and learn why you're locked up in Ryker's Island to begin with.

The game has a pretty simple formula to it and once you've done it all... you've done it all.  And yet, the game is so entertaining and engaging that the replay level is extremely high.  The graphics are crisp and clear, the music is haunting and fits in with the mood, and the unfolding storyline guarantees you wanting to complete the game.  There are a variety of weapons for you to choose from and different methods for taking out criminals.  You can perform quick kills, use them as shields to protect yourself from gunfire, and the best feature of all, interrogate the guilty.  You're going to need help along the way, so getting some answers from the criminal scum is a must.  There's simple interrogations (gun tension, choke, face smash and punch), and there are also ""special interrogations"" on each level and section (can you say ""buzz saw,"" ""shark"" and ""electric chair?"").  You can also perform ""special quick kills"" that differ from level to level.  Not to mention the intense ""slaughter mode"" where you assault your enemies with an unlimited amount of knives.

A nice bonus is that the voice of ""The Punisher"" is none other than Tom Jane, who was the star of the most recent ""Punisher"" flick.  To some, this may not be a big deal, but to fans like me, it is MAJOR.  An excellent decision, I must say.  He really adds the tone and mood of Frank Castle splendidly.

Some of the drawbacks are that the controls take a little getting used to and the number of enemies on certain sections can be overwhelming.  Also, some of the ""special interrogations"" can be tricky and if you're not careful, you may prematurely kill the only person who can help you out (I suggest using the ""special interrogations"" on enemies that don't have the white skulls above them, so that way the only penalty you'll get for prematurely wasting them is some lost points).  Like I said, once you've done everything, you've pretty much have done EVERYTHING.  However, I have to say the replay level is extremely high.  You'll want to replay certain levels over and over again.

Overall, I'm extremely happy with ""The Punisher"" videogame for PS2.  ""The Punisher"" is one of my favorite comic book characters, and this game does a fine representation of it.  If you're a fan, definitely check it out as soon as you can.

Like most RTS games, the tech trees are fairly shallow with limited options and units are not customizable beyond researching new techs for them.  There are three fairly similar races which are also not customizable.

However, it's not all bad news.

Although you'll likely be spending a lot of focus on overseeing large battles between fleets, there's also a lot of room to conduct secondary operations -- sending smaller strike teams out while the enemy is hopefully preoccupied with your main fleet.  A lot of RTS games simply don't reward this sort of thing very well but in Sins, it opens up a lot of strategic options.

Multiplayer is integrated and well supported, including a feature that lets you save and resume multiplayer games.  This is something that RTS gamers have been asking for for years.

Games can easily last several hours, depending on how many players and how big of a game you wanted.  Personally, I enjoy the option of having a ""big game"" rather than simply the small map 15-minute skirmishes most RTS games offer.

The AI is pretty good and actually pretty amusing to have on your team.  AIs will communicate with each other through standard chat and will try to coordinate with you and each other.  (Enemy AI, on the other hand, tends to be annoying by making constant demands.  This is the ""diplomacy"" aspect of the game and frankly it would probably be more fun without it.)

Graphics are very nice, should you choose to zoom in far enough to see them all, although the only reason to zoom in that far is to look at the graphics.  It's generally more practical to be zoomed out far enough that ships are dots.

I think the bottom line for me is that I see this game as a good start.  It's really nothing new.  Real time space based empire games have been done before and arguably have been done better.  However, I see this game as having a strong potential as a platform that they can build on.  I don't regret my purchase but I'm more keenly interested in what they have in mind for Sins of a Solar Empire II.  Deeper tech trees?  More races?  Customizable ships and races?

4.0,False,"09 12, 2015",A2DOTE0Y3SY7M2,B00W435BU0,Paakaa10,"In spite of the animosity directed at EA SPORTS for their Madden NFL franchise and its status as the only officially-licensed NFL game, the story of the series since the debut of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One has been of continual improvement year-over-year. With Madden NFL 16, the on-field product has continued evolution and the overall mode offerings have become more focused, but the cornerstone Connected Franchise Mode continues to get short shrift and deserves more attention than it has been given.

On the field, Madden NFL 16 offers a few new tools to separate itself from the past few titles. After a defensive-focused effort last year, this year's game offers new control modifiers for quarterbacks to have more control over passing. Using L1/LB or L2/LT and the passing icon, or tapping a passing icon twice, has the result of a high pass, low pass, or touch pass respectively. In addition to greater depth to pass controls, interactions between receivers and defenders has been given significant attention; receivers can now use X/A, Square/X, or Triangle/Y to trigger a possession, run after catch, or aggressive catch depending on the route and situation. Defenders can also choose to play the ball or play the receiver in coverage. The result is a system where the passing game feels more in user control on both sides of the ball than any Madden NFL game in recent memory. Now there is legitimate strategy to be found when deciding what catch is right for a situation, or deciding whether the risk of playing the ball on defense and going for the reward of an interception is the right move when covering a game-changing receiver. It takes getting used to in terms of re-learning how to trigger catches and defensive attempts, but the result is a much more strategic set of interactions.

The running game has gotten much less press, but it has seen nice improvements as well with regard to contextual awareness for the ballcarrier; in Madden NFL 16, the runner is much more aware of where teammates are and has a nice contextual spin move to clear through traffic. Defenders also benefit by a re-tooled gang tackling system, especially in the run game, and it can be great to watch multiple defenders converge on the ballcarrier to take them down and clean up the tackle. There are still some issues with regard to players tangling up together in the post-play, but in all it's significantly toned down from the early days of Madden NFL's physics system.

While the game's graphics continue to improve in subtle ways, the broadcast presentation still needs some work to catch up to the rest of the package. Photographers and cameramen now dress appropriately for the games and have specific bib colors to denote their task, but aside from the addition of some love-or-hate stat bubbles after plays, the majority of the broadcast remains all too similar to fans buying the game each year. Commentary doesn't seem to repeat as much as in recent years, but this may be due as much to another year of new lines being recorded as anything else.

Connected Franchise Mode offers improvements like the ability to sim specific results in an online league (a long-requested tool) as well as streamlined and more logical college scouting, but it also introduces a Dynamic Drive Goal feature which is nice in theory but has some struggles in practice. For example, if you turn the ball over on offense and the booth overturns the call and gives you the ball back, you will fail your active drive goal on offense and be stuck with a defensive goal (since the game thinks you're on defense) and you'll obviously be failing that goal too since you can't achieve a defensive result with the ball. Most frustrating from a broadcast perspective is that these drive goals show up in an ESPN BottomLine style display, just reinforcing that years removed from NCAA Football's demise, we're still left without studio updates or any greater league context in Madden NFL 16's CFM. Even the CFM menu hides league news and notes more than recent years. It's frustrating to see CFM continue to go without features enjoyed years ago in the college game.

Madden NFL 16 does offer a new mode in Draft Champions, which is essentially a ""free-to-play"" version of the popular Madden Ultimate Team where players draft a team of stars over 15 rounds to create a team for four games. For those not wanting to invest significant time or money into MUT, this is a nice middle ground. Players can go against the CPU or peers for these games.

MUT, Skills Trainer, and The Gauntlet are all still present, with similar offerings as would be expected from recent Madden history.

Madden NFL 16 sees solid improvement on the field in meaningful ways, but CFM still remains weaker than other modes in the game, especially with regard to unfortunate bugs plaguing the mode at release. For Madden NFL 17 to work towards instant classic status, intentional gameplay refinement and CFM ""catch-up"" should be prioritized.","Better on the Field, but CFM Needs Attention",1442016000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I switched to this mouse from a generic 2 button mouse that I couldn't bring myself to get rid of for far too long. I've been a gamer for ages and after 8 years of world of Warcraft I got this mouse because lets face it, I needed a lot more buttons.

The razer synapse allows you to fully program each button to do another function. I personally set them to use other hotkeys in my games so suddenly I have half my keyboard on the side of my mouse. Personally I wish the buttons were spread out because I have a bad habit of pressing two or more of the buttons at the same time so that's about my only issue with the mouse. The shape fits nicely in my hand and I love the weight of the mouse as I move around. Not too heavy or air light. The only issue I come across is I often have to start the synapse before opening a game otherwise it defaults. Not sure if my installation messed up originally causing this or its just some weird quirk about the mouse itself. Once you get it up and running its fine though.

4.0,False,"09 6, 2004",A2CK0J588YXU7S,B00006F7RJ,Tiberius,"Spearhead foreshadowed the horror that is Breakthough, through a shortfall in the single player campaign.  The campaign had numberous flaws; too short, ridiculous missions and various little things that I won't go into.

The campaign starts with you parachuting into France during Operation Overlord.  You land in a barn, and fight your way to your British comrades where for some reason your M1 Garand, MP40 and Colt .45 are replaced with an Enfield, Sten and Webley revolver.  I'm not sure why, I guess it's so you can use different weapons for a change.  I hear a lot of people complaining about having to use the Enfield instead of the Garand, but you can just use the Sten if you don't like the Bolt-Action rifle.  Either way, the campaign starts off well as you and your new friends wander the countryside blowing up artillery pieces and finally a bridge ending in a predictable cutscene where the bridge blows up as the train is about to cross and it ends up falling into the water.  Either way, the campaign is not bad up to this point.  No complaints.

Next, you're in the Ardennes fighting your way past German lines to steal a supply truck.  This part is ok, you navigate the map, blowing up Nebelwerfers (rocket launcher artillery that you should remember if you paid attenion in Allied Assault) after you use them to blow up German tanks and half tracks.  Everything's ok so far.  Once you reach a German supply depot, you fight your way to a supply truck where the campaign goes crashing into a river like the train in France.  Next thing you know, you're in a half track with an anti-tank cannon.  Your job will now be to protect the supply truck from swarms of Germans with perfect aim at great distances.  Once you beat this part, you'll know why Hitler lost the Battle of the Bulge seeing how many tanks and half tracks you'll have to destroy just to pass.  If by some miracle you do, rest assured it doesn't get better.  The next section is just a waste of time, plain and simple.  You have to run from foxhole to foxhole, waiting for the artillery barrage to stop.  After what seems like 8 hours and 50 foxholes later, you reach the medic where you have to repeat the whole thing again.  They should have just left this out as it's not challenging at all and it adds nothing to the game.  Still, the worst is not yet over.  Next you'll have to hold the line which is sort of fun as you're basically slaughtering a horde of German soldiers, but you'll fail in the most pointless of ways, if one German (it doesn't matter if he's the last one) makes it into your trench.  Apparently that's all it takes, even if you kill him a second after.  Then you have to run to another line and repeat the process and then go back and do it once more.  From then on, the campaign picks up.  You advance and clear out a town and your part in the Ardennes is over.  Nothing more worth mentioning, really.

Berlin will satsify those are obsessed with sniping as it's pretty much laid out for that.  Long ranges, rubble, unsuspecting Germans, you get a nice Russian semi-automatic sniper rifle.  I prefer the Mosin Nagant (even more so because I actually own one in real life.)  You'll get to blow up some tanks with sticky bombs and 88mm artillery cannons.  You steal the plans then the game takes a course for the bizarre.  You'll find yourself controlling a Russian T-34 all by yourself.  At least in Allied Assault, you had a team, but this is ridiculous.  That means you drive the tank and operate the gun (that is loading, firing and aiming) all by yourself with your head outside the turret (!!!).  That's one well trained soldier.  Then you fight your way back to where you started with the Russian guys I neglected to mention earlier where there's a (suprise) large dramatic tank battle.  When you win, it's all over.  Painfull short, not that great.

The multiplayer is where Spearhead really shines.  It really makes up for Allied Assault's mediocre multiplayer by adding new modes of play (Tug of War which is a more flexible kind of Objective match, really) maps, skins, weapons, etc...  Being able whack people with nearly every single weapon instead of just pistols is nice.  The Russian PPSH is very nice for short ranges (near bottomless clip) and gives Allies the chance to use bolt-action rifles if they want.  Replacing the shotgun for the Germans is the much whined about rifle grenade which is really fun to use.  Even though players claim it is the same a the rocket launcher, it's not.  You're more of a rifleman (it's just a Mauser Kar 98k that can fire a grenade at an arc at longer distances than you can throw a hand grenade.)  You don't get regular grenades so you just exchange how you can use  your grenades.

All in all, if the multiplayer wasn't such a huge improvement, I'd give it 3 stars.  If singleplayer was better, I'd give it 5 stars.  Either way, it's well worth your money as long as you like to play multiplayer.","Could Have Been Better, but Still Pretty Good",1094428800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The world you're in is run by a corporation, which is harsh and controlling. You are a male or female vigilante, and you have four maps on which you can work: a suburban mall, Chinatown, a suburb, and a corporate building.
Each map is full-roam - you can go whereever you want in it. Each map is rather large too, complete with cars, glass windows to shatter, trashcans to pick up, and up to 250 running civilians, each with his or her own personality. While the graphics aren't glisteningly crisp like in Kingdom Hearts or FFX, they're still rather good. You can read the store signs in Chinatown and see the flower design on your character's Hawaiian shirt.
There are different modes of game play, all single player only. You can just roam around in a map killing the bad security guards and gaining points from short-term goals such as ""blow up all enforcer cars"". You can do a timed mode where you have to work through a series of objectives, gaining time bonusses as you go to keep time on your clock. Finally you can take on the almost 200-mission main sequence, where you are given specific tasks to do in order and report back at the end of each one.
On one hand, you can say that the game is very repetitive. While each level has different graphics, the tasks in each one are the same - avoid hurting civilians, kill the target enemy, gather up health. The splashes of red blood are continuous (although you can turn gore off).
But on the other hand, it's an arcade game, not requiring much thought. It's mindless fun, giving quick results and easy progress. There are selections of weapons, from billy clubs to swords to flamethrowers and miniguns. After a hard day, there is great satisfaction in the smash of a plate glass window.

4.0,True,"09 16, 2016",A364QHZHDP77LO,B01GD48X5U,Chasten Ruin,"Most people won't recognize the major improvements in this version of the game if they were casual players of NBA 2K16, but there is a lot to love about this version of NBA 2K.  It's still absolutely the best basketball game on the market...hands down.  NBA 2K Day has become a sort of religious holiday for me over the last 10 years.

Let's just jump into my impressions so far:

Graphics 7/10 - The game actually took a step back on the graphics this round it seems.  There's a ""Fournier"" effect happening with all the player's eyes that make them look like some screwed up bobblehead factory accident in some far off Chinese sweatshop and it's kind of distracting from an otherwise impeccable amount of ambient detail.  Those college bands are going to riot if they see how out of sync the musicians in the game move.  I'm assuming this will become a meme, along with the bug eyes, and get patched shortly.

Gameply 9/10 - Visual Concepts really raised the bar in gameplay.  Especially in the defensive and ball handling categories.  It's quite a major overhaul that makes the game a lot more realistic.  They also did a great job of re-tuning the players, setting new mins and maxes on stats based on an archetype, which allows them to become super specialized in certain aspects of their game (i.e. the ""Steph Curry Paradox"").  But honestly, I've been so impressed with the defensive improvements even though Jamal Crawford already broke my ankles four times in the first quarter of my first MyCareer NBA game.  Also, the physics dealing with size, strength, contact seem to be much more refined.  Now you can feel a size advantage in both lost agility but increased brute force.  I used to be able to hit intense-D and I would get sucked into my man like a magnet got turned on, but it feels more real now, there's a rhythm to defense, you can actually steal now without getting called for a whistle everytime, but it has to come in the flow of the game.  Same with offensive ball handling.  I can chain a bunch of moves that don't get me stuck in the same sequences like youd see in 16.  I'm really impressed with the gameplay improvements.

UI/Menuing 7/10 - Maybe I just hate adjusting to new UI's every year, but I'm really not a fan of the interface this year, especially since the game modes roll off into a second screen.  I like the launchpage with everything there in front of me.  Maybe I'm just getting older and more cynical about each new overhaul of the interface.

Game Modes 9/10 - They really went the extra mile with game modes this year.  They made a lot of substantial improvements to MyLeague, including re-adding Online leagues (with Live Draft and Keeper Support!) so you can play with your favorite fantasy league buddies and take the smack talk to entirely new levels.  They also incorporated an Offseason mode so you can begin with your team in free agency (for everyone that isn't a Warriors fan), the regular 80-year Association (although they dropped that branding), and then of course Season and Playoff modes.  The MyLeague changes have been really refreshing.  They also tweaked MyTeam, a mode I don't play much, and pretty much turned it into pack slinging orgy where you now get ""trial"" cards that are like little hits of crack so you spend all your money buying packs for the real thing.  Some people dig that though.  MyCareer, the mode I probably play the most, is thankfully Spike Lee free and the story is significantly better.  You really feel the character creation changes along with the gameplay changes the most by playing this mode.  MyCareer has always been a real treat for me as a gamer, and I honestly think it's accessible to anyone who really loves video games.  This years version is 10x better than the groan inducing scripting of last years Spike Lee ""Da""zaster.  MyPark hasn't changed much itself, but the gameplay improvements obviously have a huge effect when playing multiplayer.

For the true fan, you've already bought the game.  I mean, let's be real.  You've been reading all the news stories, seen all the trailers, downloaded the companion app and you're probably waiting for it to finish downloading.  But for those people who are thinking about buying the game, because they are between major game releases or they are just getting tired of sniping or firing rocket launchers, it's a no brainer.  This is the best game on the market.  The single player experience in this game is just as engaging as any open world or FPS.  It's just as accessible to casual fans as it is to hardcore gamers.  MyPark's multiplayer experience rivals that of any major FPS.  This game, outside of whether or not you like sports, is truly legit.  It might actually be the best produced franchise gaming title in the entire industry and half of the people who consider themselves hardcore gamers that should be playing it are missing out.

There are tales of crashes and performance issues and other bugs galore.  But overall, if you are able to play it, step back and take a deep breath, you will see that is a nice step up from the second installment.

Many things about Sims 2 really bugged me, and alot of people.  Things that really made it more annoying than fun to play.  Monitoring the bladder and food intake was your main goal as your peeps couldn't figure out to do this on their own.  Then much of the time if your Sim was unhappy about something they would wave their arms at you and babble.  Try to figure out what they wanted if you could.  The other big problem (for me) was the time issue when your Sim(s) went out of the house.  They would leave at, say, 7pm -- head out for a night on the town and do all sorts of stuff, and when they came back -- stupidly nothing had changed from their home.  Still 7pm. But all their gauges were down.  It really made no sense.

Thankfully, that sort of disconnect is probably the biggest change in this new version.  Many people here are screaming that it is a minor change -- but i would have to disagree.  This TOTALLY changes how you play.  The world is a living breathing place that continues on 24 hrs a day rather than taking some weird time warp machine every so often.

The graphics have also gotten an improvement but it's not something that's going to bring Crysis to mind.  They are fairly similar to the last version but noticeably improved details and shading make them better.  The biggest thing is that the game renders the entire town at once, your home and the outside world.  This is a tradeoff for just making the game prettier.

That being said, the animation is frustrating at times as Sims still have robotic ways of doing things.  And they tend to do things in simple step by step manner rather than grouping tasks.

The timespace issue is still going on and it is still one of the more frustrating things.  That it takes 4 hours to get up, take a shower, make breakfast and clean the counter is bizarre.  Many times you can't really do much but that and go to work.  My Sim will take about 1.5 hours to recycle a few newspapers because they are not smart enough to pick them all up and put them away.

That being said -- it is alot easier to enjoy this game.  Their are more goals and challenges to each day that are far more interesting than previous ones.  When you go to work you can choose what your Sim does at work without actually seeing them do it (hoping for an expansion pack to address that.)  Does it matter?  YES!  Why doesn't time just rush along like before?  Because you need to monitor what your sim is doing.

The new Moodlets area is brilliant.  It finally gives you a clear insight into what you are doing right and wrong so you can work to modify it or keep it going.  This removes so much of the frustration of the previous game.

So that is just a taste of the major good and bad points of the new game.  Personally I'm glad I didn't listen to all of the bad ratings here to keep from getting it.

But -- there are some bad catches to beware of:

-- The Mac version is flawed graphically and has some really bad aliasing.  They are aware of it and are working on it, but for now play it on a PC or boot up in Boot Camp and play that way.

-- There seems to be a real lack of objects and ""stuff"" in the game.  This is easily remedied by going to the Sims3.com site and buying them.  But, as many have pointed out, they are vastly overpriced.  If this is the wave of the future then I think most people will take a pass.  The prices are exorbitant and the value compared to add-on packs is low.  Hopefully they will see the light and make them more in line.  (As an example, one set of themed furniture that has 40 pieces or so will set you back $20!)  No thanks.

-- Time doesn't speed up as it did previously.  Whether this is intended or a bug, not sure.  But be prepared to sit around for 2-5 minutes every time your Sim sleeps.  Watching them.... sleep.... zzzzzz.

So no, this game is not perfect.  But I don't feel it is the colossal disappointment that many would have you think.  I'm guessing some of the more obvious things will go away with patches.  Some will be taken care of with future expansions.  And some may be here to stay.",Flawed but a Fun Step Up from 2,1244937600,198,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

4.0,False,"02 12, 2007",A2615K4AJSX078,B00027CXEM,H.Le,"In retrospect, Osidian did a very good job with this game (compare to Neverwinter Nights 2 - which was rushed big time for Xmas delivery). True, KOTOR 1 has a better, more epic plot.  But then again, if you have played KOTOR 1, you'd probably agree that not even Lucas himself can ever top a story like that.

In its own right, however, Osidian deserve much credit for an interesting story of their own in KOTOR 2. The story is now more personal, and it takes the morality issues of the light and dark sides thing to a whole new different level that is far beyond any Star Wars movie or books out there - probably too deep that, for some people, actually takes lot of fun out of the game.

As for me, I found the character of Kreia to be one of the most complex characters in any story.  For those of you who haven't play the game, Kreia is the mysterious jedi-like figure that you meet very early in the game.  And I don't think I'll give any plot away by saying that almost immediately, you know that she is not one of the good guy, but rather one of the bad guys who's simply on your side. The only thing I'll add here (spoiler alert - maybe)is that she was a Jedi who has fallen from the light side, and eventually, fallen from the dark side as well; she has fallen so deep that she almost remind me of Mr. Kirk in Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" (or Colonel Kirk in Apocalypse Now - if you prefer that version instead. Really, I could not help but feel like Mallow pursuing Kirk rather than an outcast Jedi going after Kreia).  Therefore, the story, at least for me, is all about the anticipation that leads up to the final confrontation with Kreia; everything else is mere subplots (end spoiler).

I figure this out early in the game so the story is excellent for me.  Otherwise, all I'd do is wandering around the planet systems doing menial tasks - and this is why some people find the game to have dumb plot.

Other than that, the gameplay is very similar with KOTOR 1.  Combat is fun, especially with light sabers and force powers.  Music, sound, and voice acting is great.  Those who played KOTOR 1 will immediately feel at home with the UI.  My gripes: The new feature where you can craft items (why  Obsidian loves this feature so much I have no idea) is rather useless.  Beside light sabers, it's not much use to craft anything else that you can get by either buy or beat up someone - because chances are, in the first place,  you still have to buy or beat up someone to get the parts that you need to craft any item. Romances are poorly attempted. Either do a job that is on par with KOTOR 1 (or other Bioware games) or don't do it at all. (Spoiler alert)Also, the great scene where all the Jedi Masters are present to judge you - I'd love to get the option to fight them before Kreia can step in (end spoiler).

Your character is a newly-hired ghostbuster recruit that gets to test some new equipment when things start to go very wrong. You get to visit the Sedgewick hotel (and re-capture slimer in the same ballroom as the first movie), and many other nostalgic tie-ins to the movies.

The campaign gameplay is particularly fun. Wrangling ghosts with the proton pack and throwing out traps to catch them was right on. The only problem I had with my game was in the library where the game stuttered. But the voice acting, music (pretty much straight from the movie soundtracks sounds like), and sounds are right on. The sounds in particular. The sound of the proton pack being engaged or hearing it tear through furniture, etc.

The online gameplay is a nice addition to the game. You can pick from the 4 ghostbusters and the rookie and earn money to advance your rank. I found it also particularly interesting that certain ghosts are on the ""Most Wanted"" list and you encounter them almost randomly when playing. The missions are challenging and include: Thief (protect 4 artifacts from thieving ghosts), Protection (power up a PKE disrupter and protect it while it starts up from attack), Containment (catch all ghosts w/in timelimit), Slime Dunk (compete to slam slimers into traps), Survival (survive wave after wave of ghosts/demons). Most of the missions require teamwork from your teammates.

I assume the game's popularity has more to do with atmosphere and subject matter than anything. I didn't enjoy the actual play very much.

The box art and cutscenes might mislead unsuspecting players into thinking Vampire is an epic RPG or even a first-person adventure. It's neither. While the story, conversations, and character development are engaging, the game itself is an old-style isometric hack and slash. Which is fine, when that particular system is implemented competently. Here it only occasionally works. Too much of Vampire's environments consist of narrow hallways and blind corridors where enemies and allies alike jam themselves into environmental wedges, run headlong into adversaries, and generally act in manners directly against common sense. Level design is pretty, well detailed, and enhances the mood of the game, but it is amateurish in terms of interactivity. This would be a minor flaw if, again, the meat of the game weren't the combat itself. Yes, there are many RPG elements like character leveling and the often fun experiments with trinkets and baubles picked up at the local shops, but the fun bits devolve into frustration whenever a member of your crew runs headfirst into a gaggle of bloodsuckers, despite your commands.

The story nearly makes the gameplay endurable. I didn't know much about Vampire's universe, and was intrigued by the ""vampire mafioso"" storyline. Rather than preying on innocent damsels in distress, Vampire's protagonists are a human-sympathetic clan at war with other more sinister vampire families. The story unfolds through fairly taut and convincing (for a video game) dialogue, and the occasional cutscene. I was never bored with the story progression, and my curiosity about the next winding turn kept me playing for a good while. Eventually the infuriatingly clumsy and often poorly balanced gameplay soured the experience for me though.

If you're a huge fan of this game's particular universe, and simply MUST know how the story goes, then Vampire: The Masquerade Redemption may be worth the effort. Just be prepared for the headaches.",Take off the Goth fanboy goggles,1193529600,2,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

4.0,False,"03 12, 2004",A169I83JL8QJGN,B0000A09EN,Daniel A Moir,"When I first saw the remake of Resident Evil for GameCube one of my biggest hopes was that Nintendo would pursue remakes of other classic Playstation games for their system, and then seize the games (like they did with Resident Evil, with only Spin-off titles hitting other consoles). I hate to admit it, because I am an avid hardcore cross platformer, but deep down I'm still a Nintendo loyal, and I wanted Nintendo to take back what it lost last generation to Sony. I had hoped to see remakes of Silent Hill 1, ports of SH2, 3, and the forth-coming 4, and remakes or ports of the entire Final Fantasy series. Needless to say that the announcement of Crystal Chronicles had me in tears (not literally) over what might have been... At least Nintendo got one of the many Playstation games I'd like to see brought to their system... and it's a big one.
 Argued by many to have been the single greatest game on the original Playstation Metal Gear Solid continued the story that began way back in the late 80s with Metal Gear on the original Nintendo. Although the true sequel Metal Gear 2 was never released domestically the NES was graced with an unofficial sequel called Snake's Revenge. As far as I can tell Snake's Revenge is not relevant to the plot of Solid, which is actually Metal Gear 3.
 The storyline is well known by now, so I'll not review it, as it is sufficient to say that it remains one of the greatest games stories of all time. So good in fact, that even Metal Gear Solid 2 failed to eclipse it. What is relevant for the sake of this review is that aside from a few minor changes to the dialogue the story of the original is here and in tact.
 Obviously some people wonder what's changed? Well not much, thankfully. Silicon Knights, Konami, and Nintendo must have felt that it wasn't necessary to fix what wasn't broken. Instead they took the elements of Metal Gear Solid 2 that made it so great (hiding in lockers, moving dead bodies, etc) and used it as the basis of the Twin Snakes. The only addition to the game play I would have liked to see is better use of shadows for cover.
  Most of the voice-overs are done by the original voice actors, including David Hayter (Writer of the X-Men movie) as Solid Snake. So far the only voice that doesn't seem like the original is that of Mei Ling, and while I miss that adorable Chinese accent, one could point out that Silicon Knights was correcting a flaw of the original game... Mei Ling was born and raised in America, so it would make sense that she spoke with an American accent... even if her original voice was more fun.
 The graphics have been given a major overhaul, and kudos to Silicon Knights for the accomplishment here. Their previous outings have not been graphically impressive, but always had a decent artistic flair to them anyway. In Twin Snakes they have both. True to the artistic style of the MGS series, and yet better looking on GameCube than on any other system. I was blown away by the animation in this game. It's simply breathtaking to see how fluid everything is. The game does contain very impressive lighting, shadows, and weather effects that simply had my jaw to the floor. Character models may not be as good as those found in the Resident Evil or Silent Hill Series, but they don't fail to impress either.
 Silicon Knights proved with Eternal Darkness that they are champions of sound on the GameCube. MGSTS is no exception. Gun shots sound real, voice overs are phenomenal, little subtle sounds are very important in this game, and Silicon Knights did great with it. I was blown away by the sound, which tops 90% of the games out there.
 The enemy AI is nothing short of amazing as well. Though the original was no walk in the park by way of difficulty this game makes MGS 2 look like a kitten. The enemies are that smart. This game has me at the edge of my seat and I am a seasoned Metal Gear fan.
 In closing I want to say thank you to Konami, thank you to Nintendo, and Thank you to Silicon Knights for this amazing masterpiece. There is very little to complain about. This game is great for both nostalgia, and for newbies alike. Whatever your thoughts about GameCube this is defiantly a must have title...

Overall, the game is good.  However, when stacked against its PS3, 360, and PC brethren it fails to compare, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.

The plot is your standard alien invasion story/government cover-up.  Nothing new, but it's still intriguing.  The graphics are nice to look at, considering it's the Wii.  However, I really don't think they are that much better than Metroid Prime: Corruption's.  It does have a solid framerate with decent shadows and particle effects.  The controls are similar to Metroid's.  Aim with the Wiimote and move with the nunchuck (pretty precise).  I like how you can throw grenades using the nunchuck, but it takes a little practice (I usually end up throwing them way over the enemies heads).

There is a nice assortment of aliens/enemies.  Environments are a little bland (again, it's the Wii).  Maybe it's me, but sometimes the AI can be brutal.  Enemies come in waves and there's no cover system, so you really have to keep moving.  In that vein, the game really doesn't have much that's innovative.  Even the All Seeing Eye (A.S.E) doesn't do much more for you than expose switches on the walls or explosives on the ground.

The Conduit was the main reason I bought another Wii (I had previously sold my first one because it was collecting dust).  At this point I'm probably enjoying House of the Dead: Overkill more than The Conduit.  It's not that I don't like The Conduit.  I just may have had overly high expectations.  At some level I'm probably comparing it to Killzone 2, Gears 2, and COD4 (which I know I shouldn't do).  As a Wii FPS, it's a definite 4 stars.

This review is going to include plot points of the first game, so if you intend to play the first game and don't want it spoiled at all, this is a spoiler alert.

Kate hasn't been back to the Hof1KDs since the first game, so when she hears that it has been sighted in Trenton, New Jersey(?!)she rushes to the scene and promptly crashes her car. Luckily, it is by a dock with transportation to the house itself. Once there she finds out that the house has been plagued by fireballs that are being generated by the Palm of Zoroaster, a demonic gem. Kate must track down four crystal skulls that activate an organ that has appeared in the house made of Jericho pipes,(and is the only means of destroying the Palm of Zoroaster), as well as the gem itself.

As in the first game, Kate travels through portals and encounters some ghosts and this time a lot of skeletons that have left behind detailed diaries and notes. But unlike the first game which emphasized exploring the house and getting to know the mediums that live there, the sequel takes place mostly in exotic locations like Tibet and Jerusalem that are accessed through portals in four paintings in one of the halls of the house, though two rooms in the house are also explored. Since this is a quest to find the skulls and PofZ, the focus of the first story which was freeing the souls of troubled ghosts is very much on the back burner. Only two of the mediums from the original story make an appearance, though Kate does meet Gabriel, the mysterious figure that heads the house, in person.

I had mixed feelings about this. The game creators obviously worked hard to make this story not just a retread of the original, which is very much to be appreciated. OTOH, I really enjoyed the premise of the original story and would have liked to know more about the mediums and origins of the house. Each of the four portals gives us more information about the story behind the Palm of Zoroaster. I found the first one that leads to Tibet the most compelling part of the story, the others a bit murky and not as interesting.

This is definitely a game for those who enjoy Hidden Object Scenes as there are many and they are revisited. The scenes, like in the first game, have interactive elements and are clear and well drawn. There are also morphing objects again, this time 46 ones to find. Finding some of them was very challenging, and I ended up missing one of them in an area that I thought I searched very thoroughly, causing me to end up with 45 objects found, much to my displeasure.

The mini-games were a mixed bag. Several of them involved simply remembering where you had seen a code or sequence of symbols and duplicating the order in the mini-game. There were several old standbys like rotating or swapping pieces type puzzles and finding matching pairs, which I actually enjoy. Surprisingly, it seemed the more challenging games were reserved for the bonus chapter. A game of duplicating patterns involving a dozen eggs and a variation of swapping and putting in order numbers in two rings were my favorites.

As mentioned there is a bonus chapter in the Collector's Edition and unlike many games, I thought it was worth the extra cost. The story involves Kate helping Gabriel, and we learn some of his back story. It is long (in fact, the whole game is long, you get your money's worth there)and contains almost all new locations to search which was very impressive.

I would also point out that this game has a map that not only lets you know which locations have active areas, but transport you to the locations, something that many games don't have but I wish was mandatory.

All things considered I definitely recommend this game, and I really hope there is a third one. It could be a great franchise, like the series of Puppet Show games. After all, we still need to find out what is happening behind over 900 more doors! Hopefully none of it involving Trenton, New Jersey.","House of 1000 Doors, World Tour",1337126400,10,,

I have no experience with the monster hunter series, so this review is from a fairly non-biased perspective.

I have put in about 10 hours so far, and stayed up very late after the game arrived on my doorstep in the early evening.

The most striking initial impression I have is the depth of gameplay, mainly the nearly overwhelming amount of items that can be gathered and combined together to make useful trinkets. The environment is detailed and sensible, monsters react to each other, natural resources and to the player in a logical and semi-realistic way.

Combat takes some getting use to, and there are no character levels, so essentially besides gear upgrades, the player his or herself virtually 'levels up' by getting better at controlling the character.

Unfortunately, the Wii is not HD capable, in fact with my widescreen HD the game actually looks much worse, more grainy, than screen shots taken from non-HD screens.

The classic controller is not the highest quality, and ranged attacks in zoomed in mode, basically like a first-person shooter mode, are not as fluid as it would be  with a xbox360 or a ps3 controller.

The story is light, so it is not a typical RPG in that sense, but there is so much to do and experience, to include a wealth of quests, so much so that any player will always find some rewarding enterprise to undertake.

I certainly recommend this purchase highly, and will likely invest hundreds of hours in the game myself. I have  yet to try online play because I feel like I need to practice in single player first, but I can see how playing with a party can be very rewarding, possibly even necessary.

Kills are gratifying as the screen does this little 'pulse' to let you know when you've dealt the fatal blow. While there is a backdrop of 'revenge-of-my-murdered parents' plot, the game has a small city of Brimstone with npc characters to chat with and get more storyline. There are also shops you can enter to purchase goods and spend money unlocking journal pages (a readable scrap book that gives background information on items, places, things in the game) and showdown characters. These showdown characters make for another side game more suited for multiplayer purposes. A good array of guns and other weapons equals non-stop action.

4.0,False,"03 26, 2006",A285YCRWRJVM1R,B0009JB3J4,Super Cool,"As the title indicates Ultimate Spiderman has a very short single-player story, which can probably be completed in six hours or even less.  The length of the game, however, is considerably lengthened side-tasks most of which are web-swinging races, some of which are gang beat-em-ups, and occasionally rescuing and searching for hidden tokens.  These side-tasks are by no means side-quests and are by no means as entertaining as the main story, so why do they comprise the majority of the game's length is a question that will boggle the minds of gamers.  This game had the potential to achieve greatness, but falls short due to shortness of story.  The inked-cartoonish look of Spiderman is great although not as spectacular as the model Spiderman in Spiderman the Movie game, which I have also reviewed.  I have yet to play Spiderman II, but at some point I plan to.  However, the short story of Ultimate Spiderman is far superior in gameplay than the gameplay of Spiderman the Movie.  Playing as both Spiderman and Venom is great and both characters are well-designed with fabulous inked-comic book looks, which in a way maybe better than the more deeply modeled look in Spiderman the Movie.  Play as Spiderman you feel both swift and powerful, while playing as Venom you feel a great sense of power and monstrous rage.  It is great.  The majority of missions are as Spiderman, which is fine.  The most spectacular parts of this game are the boss battles.  Wow, you truly fight gigantic characters in this game, that would seemingly crush Spiderman but cannot for his speed and wit are too great.  Venom leaps tall buildings in a single-bound just to give you a hint about his power.  The game has various unlockables but they are for the most part afterthoughts.  The Spiderman missions involve saving bystanders, chasing enemies down and cornering them, and fighting them with a strategy.  One major difference in this game than in the movie game is that Spiderman can actually fight well; he has got some skills and combos are quite easy to perform.  Not too many three-button combos here, but rather combos linked by bouncing off-walls or one opponent to the next.  It is a neat and rewarding combo system.  The few moves that are missing from Spiderman in this game that I liked in the movie game are impact webbing, webbed fists, and the web dome, of which the web dome was the most effective move in the game.  Impact webbing is a neat idea because you send a ball of webbing at high speed.  Do not think that would be effective, well then think again because it would probably be more effective than hurling a high-speed basketball at someone.  All the same the moves in Ultimate Spiderman just make sense and are good enough to really enjoy.  Spiderman is no longer a wimp that can be bullied by an ordinary street thug.  He is seriously tough in this game.  Venom, on the other hand, is back-breakingly tough meaning he can do back-breakers and skull-breakers, which is super cool.  The races against J Storm are entertaining and the other races are fun for a while but not enough that you want it to replace at least a few more hours of the story that you feel just should have been there.  In this case, less races and side-tasks is more, as in more better.  Rescuing the random New Yorker in distress, however, is quite entertaining and I try to rescue them every chance I get.  This part of the game should be kept because it is so random that it is entertaining and it seems like something that Spiderman would do.  The web-swinging in Ultimate Spiderman, however, probably has even more camera problems when making tight turns and leaps than the web-swinging in Spiderman the Movie game.  This observation is important when you consider that majority of the time spent completing Ultimate Spiderman are the races.  Also, in Ultimate Spiderman you have to work to keep swinging and speed up, unlike in Spiderman the Movie game where you can just hold down the R button or one of those buttons.  This idea is good and bad because you can no longer mindlessly swing, which is good because mindlessly swinging is not realistic at all, but you have to continuosly press buttons during swinging, which is bad because it can get tiresome especially during a long race.  The web-swinging of Ultimate Spiderman has a redeeming quality, however, because you can combo your swings and it becomes easier to do as you become more familiar with the controls.  For instance, you can swing, swoosh, somersault, swing swoosh, double somersault, and swing, swoosh, and back-flip, which are all super cool.  All in all, Ultimate Spiderman is a fun and great game while the story lasts, but next time Activision should put a longer story in their game and maybe then it would have spectacular.  It is definitely worth $20 but not the $50 that I paid for it.",Ultimate Spiderman is indeed ultimate but only for a short period of time,1143331200,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' GameCube'}",

Note that I have been a fan of 007 games since Goldeneye and most of my childhood consists of the classic ps2 games like Nightfire and Everything Or Nothing.

PROS:
Original 007 Storyline
Beautiful level designs, each different than the last.
The sneaking aspect is well put together.
An array of weapons ranging from the standard P99.
Perfect voice acting.

Cons:
The driving aspect i personally despise, my car would do a 180 when crashing.
No real time damage while driving.

One more thing, there's the aspect of ""focus aims"". Essentially, when you get 3 undetected kills in a row, you can then use these focus kills. Focus Kills allows you to do a slow-motion aiming (headshots anyone?) If i had to compare this to any other bond game, it would be Everything or Nothing as it's a third person stealth shooter.

Having played Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, I welcome this new version, which mercifully removes the horrible underwater battles and replace it with climbing, jumping and mounting monsters!!! I played 100+ hours on MH3U and then I actually stopped playing (particularly hated the underwater battles), but I've already sunk in 200+ hours with MH4U and STILL playing it due to its much more fun gameplay, seamless online multiplayer gaming, beautiful graphics and of course, the crazy monsters and the monthly FREE DLCs that Nintendo keeps gifting to us MH4U players! I'm glad I took the time to learn MH3U so with MH4U it's a lot easier for me to just pick up and go.

There is SO much replay value, and hunting the same monster species feels different each time because of the monster AI, location where it is, etc. The new weapons (my favourite being Insect Glaive, having used Long Sword in the past) are just super fun to use. And of course, I often get hit by the monsters as I get distracted on trying to mount them...! Fun fun fun!

The multiplayer truly shines through here. It is so seamless to go online multiplayer, and playing with a bunch of strangers doesn't matter when all 4 hunters have the same goal - slay (or capture) the blinking monster!!! It's so strange, you end up making some friends with these hunters really. Generally the multiplayer community is friendly to new and experienced players alike, which is helpful.

It's so unbelievably good that I bought a New Nintendo 3DS XL (MH4U themed of course) for this game alone, but of course, benefitting me for other games too with faster loading times, etc. If you haven't tried it MH4U is actually much more newbie friendly in that it guides you through most of the stuff so you don't fumble (like in MH3U).

Pros:

*Macro keys: I love this feature.  They are easy to program.  You just press the ""macro record"" key, select a macro key, and then hit whatever key combo you need.  Press the record key again and you're done.  I have used this for various things, including:

  *Remapping W, A, S, D to the keypad (I'm left handed).  Some games don't let you use the arrow keys.
  *Making multi-key combos into a single keypress (I use Shift+space to read through my Google reader from the oldest to the newest.

*Volume knob: This is wonderful too.  The thing that annoys me most about video games is that once it's running, you can no longer adjust the Windows volume level.  If I turned it down while on the web, I had to exit the game to turn it on again.

*The keypad is removable: yes, you can move it from side to side, but you can also get it out of the way completely if you don't need it.

*The cruise control button is also nice (and it may help with those people having the ""Ctrl+W+R"" problem).

*Good solid construction overall.

Cons:

*Like others have mentioned, the keys have been rearranged some.  I have definitely found myself pressing ""~"" at odd times.

*The backlight (which can be turned off) makes the keyboard hard to look at when the lights are on.  As I am not in the habit of gaming in the dark, this stays off most of the time.

*The knob for the volume seems a little flimsy.  I'm not sure how it will hold up in the long run.

I was way wrong in thinking that and if it wasent for you guys I would have never bought this.

While looking for ps4 exclusives to play (since everything I have is on steam nowadays) I kept seeing this pop up  on my amazon recommendations and decided to read why people were so hyped about it. I purchased the first game remaster on the recent psn sale for $10 (to my knowledge the physical copy isn't available in the US and is overpriced import..) and fell in love with it even for a vita game so buying this ps4 designed game was a no brainer.

This exponentially raises the bar on everything that made the first game great. Sure online aspects have shut down but they don't deter from the gameplay and enjoying the world and interactions of everything. Kats random voice sounds are adorable in each conversation, its not too ""family friendly"" but not too over the top violence. Its like watching a wholesome anime with good action/plot moments.

I eventually downloaded the demo and thought it played very well so I decided it would be worth the purchase.  My son has been playing it and I can gladly say he is enjoying.  The controls are smooth and he's is plowing through the levels with ease.  The puzzle sequences are so well put together to where they're not too hard but yet it gives him a challenge.

It was one of my first Wii games, and it was the game I had the most fun with, by far. The game to this day feels revolutionary and is great to pick up and play.

It's a collection of microgames, you have 5 seconds for each game. Now to me, that sounds bad and I wouldn't expect to get any fun out of it. Well, having been a fan since the GBA original, I for one know this series is very fun. Its all about the entertainment, and boy does Nintendo provide us with lots of it! Before each microgame starts, a box will pop up showing you how to hold your Wiimote. This prevents tons of confusion. Without this, we wouldn't know what the hell to do. When each game starts, instructions will appear for a second. They are usually 1 or 2 words; You get the point. Adding in the control scheme, quickly your mind must decide what to do. And for the most part, its not hard to understand. If you are fluent in your mind's movements, then you should be okay while playing this game. It makes you think fast!

The animation is wonderful. Through each of the many stages you can play, there is a cute little animation of things such as dancing cats or cheerleaders cheering you on that move around before each microgame starts. These are very entertaining to look at, so the game always has you enjoying what it has to offer. There are also boss stages which are not timed, and these can be very fun. Some of them aren't as good as others. They range from a Punch-Out clone to a full blown SNES Star Fox blastathon! Insanely awesome!!

The music is original, and the sound effects are funny. The game also has sounds come out of the Wiimote, and that's always interesting to hear. One microgame has you pick up the Wiimote like a phone, only to have the Wiimote's speaker say, ""Sorry, you have the wrong number"". Revolutionary, I say. Absolutely revolutionary.

The game is full of fast paced action and has many stages, as well as hundreds of microgames. Its full of replay value, and once you beat it, its always fun to back and play some more microgames. There are also a few unlockable standalone games with no time limit, in which you go for the biggest score possible. Can Shooter is similar to Duck Hunt, check that fire out.

I highly suggest this to every Wii owner. It appeals to the most casual, as well as the most hardcore of gamers. It also seems vastly underrated, like Wario's other game on the Wii, Wario Land: Shake It. Wario needs love just like Mario, and I say give it to him. By God, give it to the man. He deserves it. Wario has never disappointed us. Ever.",Revolutionary fun! This should not be passed up at ALL.,1289347200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The rhythm games begin easy, as expected, but the difficulty spikes pretty quickly. Sometimes I could spend half an hour trying to beat one rhythm game to advance the story. I love this difficulty and it has had my gamer blood pumping ever since one hour into the game. I played it for five hours straight before putting it down - this game is tons of fun and I highly recommend it.

The gameplay varies in each rhythm game as well as during the story mode. Mainly you go from area to area in Paris while trying to find people, information, objects or solve a mystery, but I really liked the overworld system where it is displayed on the top screen while the area is displayed on the bottom screen, allowing quick transitions and no need to wait long while switching between areas. It's convenient and makes great use of the dual screens. Rhythm games are placed throughout to add to the story or just as an optional extra.

The story was surprising but at the same time gradually builds up so there's not too much shock at once. When I first got this game, I was expecting something somewhat realistic, but uh, well no. It's definitely science fiction. I don't want to give out spoilers, but the best way to describe it is a classic Pokemon movie where the plot slowly builds up while introducing new bonds between enemies and friends and then something extraordinary appears, say a large floating castle or something.

The music is beautiful, as well as the animations. You can collect music and cutscenes throughout the game by either finding them or redeeming them with coins scattered everywhere. Also, I found the dancing level between Raphael and Marie to be absolutely adorable.

GOOD:
- Four-player online (or offline) co-op Gameplay allows two; three, or four players play through the game from start to end. A co-op player can come into the game at any time and leave at any time (note only one of you will play as the Master Chief, while another will play as the Arbiter, and the other two players will be Elites that work with humans)
- Great looking graphics and animation, that look even better then Halo 2, F.E.A.R. and just as good as Bioshock, while these graphics might not look as good as Gears of War do to some people these graphics still are some of the best seen to date.
- Intense multiplayer action online through Xbox Live with matches as small as one on one and as big as 16 players (and offline with out using Xbox Live using either spilt screen, or system link). Halo 3 is set up similar to Halo 2 in the sense that you're given a rank when you play multiplayer (this rank can go up or down at any time) this rank is representative of your skill and your matched with others of your skill type, that way new unskilled players and hardcore veterans will not often play against one another, unless they make a special match themselves that ignores rank.

BAD:
- Confusing plot to new players of this franchise - Playing Pervious games and read the Halo Novels will fill you in on the details, if you are incline to learn them.
- No Clan Support (like in Halo 2) - This might get fixed in a future patch
- Game is considered short to some (Campaign Story Mode).

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
- A Sci-Fi First Person Shooter with quick pacing and vehicle combat.
- Co-op and online versus/team games is the big draw here.
- NEW MODE: Forge is a mode that lets you edit all the maps in Halo 3, while you cannot rebuild the maps themselves you can in this mode, add and take away any and all of the objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones. This is all done in real time and you can invite friends to this mode while your customizing the map(s), they can play a multiplayer game while your doing this (instead of just waiting for you) and if you want you can forgo editing the map and join the game at hand as either a player or the map editor (who looks like 343 Guilty Spark), while playing as the map editor you can still add and take away any and all objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones any time you want.
- NEW MODE: Theater Mode is a video editor that lets you record and play back any and all matches from Campaign, Multiplayer, and Forge modes from the point of view of any player either in first person or third person (even in a orbit-cam where the camera circles around the player) all in real time (you can also pause this at any time as well as fast forward and rewind), even use your camera to fly around the match and see the match from any angle you want, Don't forget you must save your videos before you turn off the game or you will lose said videos. Also you can take a picture at any time and save it to your Xbox 360 then download your picture at Bungie.net

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
- Halo 2 (Xbox)
- Halo (Xbox)
- Resistance: Fall of Man (PS3)
- Bioshock (360)
- Gears of War (360)

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- There are bonus items scattered through the Campaign Story Mode called Skulls getting these ""Skulls"" will make the game harder (by doing things like turning off radar for the rest of the Campaign Mode your playing it) but will also greatly increase your meta game score for the Campaign Mode.
- There are two different limited collectors editions of this game. One is called the limited edition, which comes in a metal tin and has a bonus disc (with behind the scene videos and such) and also comes with an art book. While the other limited edition (called Legendary edition) you will find an art book a mini poster two bonus DVDs (with behind the scene videos and such as well as a collection of all the cut scenes form Halo and Halo 2 and themes you can download to your 360) And the it comes with a plastic Master Chief Helmet to keep your DVDs in (Helmet as big a volley ball).
- At Bungie.net you can sign up and pay a small fee to upgrade your Halo 3 account (default is free) to hold more space on their serves for your videos/pictures/clips that you made.",Return of the King,1190678400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41-ZOo3G0eL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cRifZ3F+L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511tF-QJLSL._SY88.jpg']"

It is a wonderful mix of sci-fi horror 3rd person shooter with a great story, plenty of action and gore.....creepy.  A good example of the scare tactics used in this game are the wall busters(as I like to call them) you could be all caught up in the moment only to have a creature bust through the vent shaft, ceiling, glass...any where they can and scare the heck out of you!  You will get goose bumps(I know, I have) The controls might take a little time for some as there are 2 button combinations for some actions like: LT+A or LT+RB which should not be to difficult to pick up pretty quickly.

The graphics are top notch along with a spooky sound track that you would expect from this type of game.  The story is done very well in my opinion and keeps you alert as to what you need to do next.  There is a very helpful direction laser as I like to call it,  that when activated (Pressing down on the right thumb stick) can show you the direction you need to go, very helpful if you get stuck.  There are some zero gravity areas that some gamers might find disorienting a bit, but should not be for most.

5.0,False,"08 10, 2005",AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00004LC81,R.A. McKenzie,"Holy crap!  How did Konami and company pull this one off?

What we basically have here is a game that takes almost everything we loved about ""Metal Gear Solid"" on the PlayStation, and crammed it onto a GameBoy Color cartridge with a new story.  It sounds impossible and doomed to fail.  But you must believe me --- this is one of the greatest ""Metal Gear"" games, and fans only familiar with the Solid titles on the 3 PlayStations are missing out.

The gameplay is surprising sharp.  As Solid Snake, you can brush up on your skills with the VR Training levels.  Believe me, these will come in handy if you want to master the gme.  Snake basically has all of the skills he had in the original ""MGS"".  He can flatten against walls to hide from the enemy. He can acquire weapons on the battlefield from handguns to rocket launchers.  He is given a radar to scope out the area.  In short, this is the Solid Snake fans have loved since 1998 (or 1988 for you original loyal fans).

The story has nothing to do with the Sony MGS games, but it doesn't have to.  It begins pretty similar to how ""Metal Gear"" did, with terrorists taking over an African fortress, and it's up to Snake to stop them.  Although this GameBoy story doesn't really get into philosphy as much as the Sony console games, this is still a tight espionage thriller.  The story is well-presented through Codec conversations that don't run on for too long, and animated cutscenes that are better than anything the NES gave us.

One difference between this GameBoy adventure is that this ""Metal Gear Solid"" is broken into 13 levels.  This is actually a great thing, because it offers you a chance to replay your favorite chapters.  Plus, it helps guide the player to the right path, rather than risk endless backtracking.  But make no mistake - this is still a ""Metal Gear"" game to its core, from the stealth tactics to the over-the-top bosses.  And like every other ""Metal Gear"" game in this beloved franchise, it has a few moments that seem to go beyond the core elements of the game.  I'm referring to the sequence where you must use the conveyor belts and your cardboard box to smuggle your way through the base.  How did they come up with that?

If there is one thing to fault with this version of ""Metal Gear Solid"" (besides the unavoidable lack of voice acting), it's way you can dispose of your enemies without getting caught.  Granted, this wasn't a big deal until 2001's ""MGS 2"", but nowadays, it's a tad silly that you can take out your enemies with little risk of getting caught.  But if you choose to challenge yourself and remain stealthy... you're in for a delightful challenge.

One last thing - the music is handheld perfection.  I hum some of these tunes to this day, and I hadn't played this game for many years.

The GameBoy Color release of ""Metal Gear Solid"" is among the greatest games in handheld history, with a high quality of innovation and entertainment.  If you don't own a GameBoy Color or original GameBoy Advance, this game is worth the purchase alone.  I'd even call it a superior game to the PlayStation original.

From the safety of their living room.

The Collector's Edition comes packaged in a Pip-Boy Crate. Press the side latches to open the center. Inside, you'll find the centerpiece PIP-BOY and the game placed stealthily at the top.  The game comes in a metal case.  Also included is a large fold out ""map"" featuring the Perks for Fallout 4.

The Pip-Boy itself is the main reason you're reading. It's surprising sturdy, made with hard plastic and two metal clasps. Inside is a foam insert so your arm fits comfortably. There is also a velcro strap to ensure it doesn't fall off or move around. My forearm is quite large and I find the velcro to be unnecessary.

The top opens up to reveal the compartment where you can rest your phone. I have a Galaxy s5. It did NOT fit well. I had to press very hard to make it fit, and while it did, I needed to get a hard, flat object (I used a sculptor's file) to get it back out. Despite not fitting well, the app looks amazing set inside the Pip-Boy. It DOES link up with your game and you can manually navigate through the menu screens, check your map, and all the other functions of the Pip-Boy featured in the game.

It comes with a nice stand that you can set it on if you'd rather admire it or when you need a break from killing deathclaws (radroaches for you greenhorns).

I did do one boneheaded thing - I did not read the instructional manual before checking out the Pip-Boy. Because of this, I discovered some of the ""interactive"" buttons and dials to be a bit flimsy. You can twist and turn a few of them, but as you can see in one of the photos, I ended up popping the top button (7 in the manual) in. I mistakenly thought this was the way to open the top. Even though I'm disappointed and a little sad that I've already broken my Pip-Boy (Bethesda - any suggestions?), it still looks very nice and will be an excellent addition to my collector's shelf.

All in all, if you can afford to purchase the Pip-Boy Edition and are a fan of Fallout, I recommend grabbing one. The Pip-Boy is fantastically designed, and unlike some collector's editions, looks built to last.

5.0,False,"02 28, 2013",A1P0JSFW184ZXJ,B0091I20E6,Geek Girl,"I was an early adopter when Razer first came out with it's Naga MMO mouse. I paid full price right up front because I just had to have it. If you play MMO's like WoW, you immediately understand why you need this mouse when you look at all the buttons! While I love my Naga to pieces, after a little over a year of moderate use, it started to fail. I have never had a mouse fail on me before, much less one I spent $100 on, so that was a huge disappointment. When I realized it was failing (cursor was jumping all over the place randomly or not responding at all) I decided to upgrade and get the wireless Naga Epic. I had been using that until this guy arrived.

Performance wise, I see very little difference between the G600 and the Razer Naga. They both glide easily, are extremely responsive, and have all the buttons your heart desires. The only real differences are really in the design. They both have the same 12 buttons on the panel, however the G600's buttons are larger and more raised where the buttons on the Naga are more low profile and easier to slide your fingers across. Which one is best really depends on you. It does take some time to get used to both, but the adjustment time to really get good at the Naga may be more difficult because it's harder to discern which button you're pushing without looking at it initially. Over time as you gain the muscle memory, this isn't an issue. However, I can see how the more pronounced Logitech buttons would be easier to navigate without looking. It's worth mentioning that Razer ships their Nagas with rubberized stickers that you can place on the buttons to help you navigate them if you desire. I didn't use them but in essence it achieves the same thing as the larger, more defined G600 buttons though some may not like the idea of stickers. Again, neither one is better, it depends on your preferences.

Where the G600 may have an edge is the new ""ring finger"" button along the right side. Being totally honest, this was a pain to become adjusted to because I am used to using that side as part of my grip. It was difficult to adjust to the Naga's side panel at first also because I was so accustomed to using that as part of my grip as well. But, I adjusted and I do very well with all the practice I've had. That being said, the G600 has this issue two-fold. You have to adjust to not using either side in your grip, instead guiding the mouse with pressure from the top and back of the mouse alone. Again, it just takes getting used to and whether you want that extra button is totally personal preference. I hold down the shift key to double my number of buttons, but I do think having an extra button on the mouse can only be a good thing. However, if you can live without the extra button, Naga offers grip customization via different panels you can swap in and out on the mouse. I would tend to prefer the extra button as I can get used to almost any grip, but I can't add an extra button down the road.

Both also sport the two buttons behind the wheel. These are typically your forward/back buttons with the browser that many mice have these days. The original Naga had these buttons on the left side above the panel, which is the typical placement. With later versions, they moved these buttons behind the wheel like the G600. At first I haaaaated this so much, and then I realized, hey, this is actually so much better! I don't have to lift my index finger off the main button to activate it anymore as I can just push it with my knuckle now. Sounds difficult perhaps, but it's really so much simpler and I wish they had thought of it sooner. I typically assign these buttons to something that needs to be used often and within a small window of time, such as Kill Shot for a hunter in WoW or my ""Oh no!!"" button that contains a macro with all my life-saving abilities, priceless for PvP! Which one has the edge? The G600's buttons are more raised and require a bit more pressure to activate. The Naga's buttons are nearly flush with the surface of the mouse and require slight pressure, enough that you don't activate it on accident but not hard enough that it's difficult to push. I prefer the feel of the Razer myself.

I really don't want to compare the Naga Epic (the wireless version of the Naga) to the G600, but I think it's worth mentioning that there is a wireless option, albeit for nearly twice the price when not on sale. I got my wireless Naga Epic for only $20 more than the G600 and I absolutely love the feature. The way they have integrated wired, wireless and charging is simply awesome. When comparing the price of the two, it's clear to choose the cheaper one as the quality of both is excellent. However, if you find the Naga Epic on sale, it's really a no brainer for me. I utilize the wireless option all the time when I hook my gaming PC up to my 50"" plasma. You can't play on a big screen with a corded mouse! Not without a sore neck and headache, anyway. I really miss this feature in the G600, but again, when not on sale it's hard to justify the extra money for the wireless option.

In the end, both contenders are such great performers, it's impossible to fault either of them. With the regular price of the G600 $10 less than Razer's wired Naga, you'd not be missing any features and you'd save yourself some money. However, when they are so similar in every way, the final decision comes down to design for me. While the black G600 has an acceptable albeit very ""normal"" appearance, the white G600 is not at all appealing to me. If they had done it all in white, it would be different, but I do not care for the two tone effect. The Naga's sleek, all black, rubberized texture is beautiful and I'm not above the fancy glowing effects on the body and wheel of the mouse in addition to the buttons. Both feature the ability to change the panel colors, but only Naga has the awesome glowing logo and glowing wheel. If you're going to be spending this much on a gaming mouse, you may as well get one that looks great! The $10 difference is worth it to me to pick up the (in my opinion) more attractive Naga. The wireless Naga Epic also features a spectrum option, where the colors cycle and fade in and out. Quite awesome, but I know there are people out there who will say ""Who cares?! You're not looking at your hand while you're playing a game!"" and this is true, but I still like the sexy style and feel of the Naga. I like function and style, and with so little difference in price, I don't see the need to make the sacrifice.

The G600 gives the Naga a run for it's money. Even though it's not the prettiest mouse, it matches Razer's Naga on every level and even boasts something the Naga cannot, the extra button. You can't go wrong with either choice. Highly recommended! :)",Look out Razer!,1362009600,,"{'Color:': ' White', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",

Let me explain,

This game gives you everything EXCEPT open world ganking and glowing weapons. I'll break this down even further;

PVP COMBAT -
Not really much of it. There is a few PVP scenarios you can get into, but for some reason they aren't very popular. If you get into a Ballista or Brenner or something of that nature its a scheduled thing, unless you start one yourself... then its even harder to people to go with you. But if you find a good group of people who want to do this, the rewards can be great!

PVE COMBAT -
Open world is HUGE. There are tons of different monsters and beastmen you can battle against. Unlike many other MMOs out there, the mobs don't all look the same here! Higher level ones with challange you with more abilities, and that makes for interesting game play for sure. Oh, and this game is not really Gear Oriented, but in most cases, skill oriented (Ninja tanking, for example).

QUESTS -
Holy Cr@p there are a Sh!!ton of quests in this game! Down side to them is they don't give you experience points. They do, however give you a fame rating for the city/town you do these quests for... and fame sticks with your character (toon for you WoW fans) for the life of it. As you can see, I have been playing this game for a very long time, and I have yet to repeat 1 single quest (unless I want to help someone else do it). Massive content that no other game EVER has came even remotely close to being able to match.

CRAFTING -
Some people like it. It takes a lot of time, as do most things in this game. You can make probably 60% of the items in the game through crafting. Personally, I'm big on this games Fishing. You actually have to fight the fish and wear it down to get it up out of the water. Good stuff!

CHARATER CREATION -
As far as looks go, theres not a big difference in anything other than race selection and hair color that anyone will notice much. Hume = Male or Female Human, Elvaan = A tall elf (compared to Santa Style or WoW) either Male or Female, Tarutaru = A very small pudgy (sometimes refered to as Cute) Male or Female humanoid, Mithra = a Female only cat that walks on 2 legs, and Galkan = a Massive Non-gender (refered to as male though) Hulking Dinosaur looking thing. Each race has thier own strengths and weaknesses associated with job selection.

JOB SELECTION -
Fisrt off, theres a ton, and patcheds keep adding more! Heres the list:

Warrior, Depending on the way you pla, can be a tank or a damage dealer

White Mage, A caster of healing magic

Red Mage, the jack of all things magical, the master of enfeebaling

Black Mage, Master of the Dark Magic

Blue Mage, Learns the abilitys of what its fights and uses them against your opponenets

Monk, The Master of Martial Arts with Hand and Foot

Thief, Steal Items and Money, Stab enemeys in their backs and run away fun!

Dragoon, Calls and controls his/her own dragon and wields a deadly spear

Paladin, A very Heavily Armored Tank with magic to heal themselfs

Dark Knight, A very Heavily Armed Dealer of Death

Beast Master, Charm enemys and force them to fight others for you

Puppet Master, Controls a puppet to do its bidding for them

Ninja, Master of Deception!

Samauri, Wields a Giant Katana and uses it to inflict many skills quickly

Dancer, Uses the power of Dance to change to do various abilities

Bard, Sing or Play an intrument to give your group various power boosts

Scholor, Can instantly switch between Black and White magic

Corsair, uses a deck of cards (and a gun) to give boosts to your group

Ranger, Pretty much like any ranger in any game

Summoner, call upon the mightiest of all creatures the History of FFXI has offered to fight for or with you

More, I'm sure there is, but theres just so many I forget about them all!

And on top of that, just because you chose 1 job at the beginning don't mean you have to start a new character to start a new job. Simply go into your house and talk to your Moogle, viola, change your job. You keep all the levels you have earned and all the experience and everything as you progress through the game. And thats not all with job selection, after lvl 18 you can do a quest to get a support job to your main job. For example, you are a lvl 18 warrior, and want to be able to cure yourself... well warrior does not have magic, so you go talk to your moogle and select white mage as a support job (I don't really reccomend doing this, but its a good example), now, you are a Warrior/White Mage. Your support job can be = to or less than your current main jobs level. Example again, 18warrior/9white mage. Max level in this game is 75, and that point you have the merrit system to make you even more powerful, which also carry on to other jobs if you chose to play a different one.

CUSTOMIZATION -
You pretty much choose the way you want to play the game. Although there are strong notions as to the way you should play a particular class, mainly because the game has been out for so long, but really theres nothing to stop you from doing things the way you want.

WoW bored me after a year, well, long before that, but I had a lvl 70 and wanted to see what endgame had to offer... that was a dead end for sure. I was also tired of how one-sided the PvP system was... IE; Rogues stun lock you, kill you, and theres nothing you can do about it while the swirly junk is over your head. This is not the case with FFXI, as EVERY job is perfectly ballanced. Your Human Skill, really does make the difference.

Theres never any lag issue. At all. Ever. The servers run like a finely tuned sports car.

This game is for PS2, Xbox360, and PC, so youll see a TON of people still playing this game today, and all day every day.

There really is almost TOO much to this game, and can be quite overwhelming, especially for the new player. The game helps out with that though, as it does start out slow, and gets faster and faster as you progess.

If you are a new player, and end up on the Titan Server, look myself or my wife up and one of us can help you out! I am Robotchicken, my wife is Shadowsith.

Basiclly, if you have come to the point of reading this review, just stop what your doing, buy this game, and get hooked like the rest of us. Sure you won't see glowy weapons or floating skulls off your shoulders like WoW, but you also won't see any of the cartoony kids stuff either. This is just purely a great game with tons of social interaction.",I just keep comming back to this MMO,1230595200,6,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

I am not a big fan of strategy RPGs so this game was a bit of a hard sell for me. I'm still not a big fan of them, but this game is about the best you can get. Certainly on a portable system. The controls, level design, interactiveness, etc. are all perfect. I particularly appreciated how they took advantage of the 3DS's capabilities despite being essentially sprite-based. There is also a great deal of character interaction including a marriage system where you can set your characters up. This can lead to a sort of creepy eugenics race where ""breeding"" the correct pairs leads to superior offspring, but if you ignore thinking too much about that then the interactions are just fun. There are an awful lot of sidequests and extra options to pursue here once the main story is done. The game itself can be completed in about forty hours, but if you want to get all the dialogue options it can take over a hundred. And there's more DLC coming!

The graphic scenes, all hand-painted, are absolutely beautiful. And the puzzles are challenging, fun and not all that easy. This is a feast for the eyes as well as the brain.

""Magic"" is that species of hidden object game in which pieces of various items are scattered around the environment. -the motif is similar to the Mortimer Beckett games. The objects in their entirety that need to be found are pictured at the bottom of the screen but you have to hunt all over for the often weeny pieces of that object. When you have collected the entire item, say, a hammer or a shield, it goes in your inventory and you have to decide what to do with it as each object fits back into one of the scenes in a specific place, in other words it integrates and performs a function.

Many of the scattered pieces cannot be found until you successfully solve a mini-puzzle, and these puzzles are original and intriguing and challenging. In one you have to connect a series of pipe pieces so that none of the segments drip water- it's a leaky pipe to begin with. It took me many tries to solve this one but when I finally did essential information appeared, allowing me to proceed. All of these unusual mini-puzzles require solving, you can't skip them or you're dead in the water! They're timed, too, but not horrendously so. You can do them! There are many walkthroughs on Google if you get stuck!

You are guiding a young girl on a quest to find her brother and thwart manifestations of evil along the way as you careen from one exotic place to another- Mayan ruins, an English castle, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece. You visit an African shaman and a Native American wigwam and a spooky graveyard and many more colorful locations. Hints are readily available for each environment but you have to earn them.

CAVEAT: The cursor behaves rather erratically in this game. I had thought the problem was with my set until I read other peoples' complaints.

Batman: Arkham Asylum changes all that.  This eagerly anticipated game is hands down the best superhero game that you will ever play, boasting big production values and enough fun for anyone to pick up and play, even if you're not a Batman fan.  The storyline finds Batman trapped in Arkham Asylum, and going toe to toe with waves of thugs and a number of villains from his great rogues gallery.  Utilizing some punishing attacks and inventive gadgets, Arkham Asylum is plenty addictive and offers up enough engaging, easy to pull off combat that you can't help but enjoy what you get here.  Not to mention that the game also offers up some great moments of stealth, detective work, and almost everything else you'd expect to do if you were Batman (minus drive the Batmobile, which personally would have the icing on the cake here), and it does it all spectacularly well.  There's also over 200 riddles from the Riddler (naturally) to solve in order to unlock a horde of extra content including Challenge mode maps, and the game as a whole looks grim, gritty, and superbly detailed and animated.  But singing the game's praises here hardly does it the justice that it deserves.  It goes without saying that if you're a Batman fan in the least, you need to get your hands on Batman: Arkham Asylum.  It is without a doubt the best Batman game, and best superhero game, to ever see the light of day, and it deserves your time and attention.

5.0,False,"04 2, 2005",A3E8OD9EKMMDEJ,B0002ILSJM,The Game,"This is definetely by far the best NBA game to ever hit any game system up to date, made by EA Sports, NBA Live 2005 is definetely a hit sports game and always will be. I will now break down my review in terms of graphics, gameplay, audio, and online play.

Graphics: The graphics in this game aren't actually all that great. They look very similar to those of NBA Live 2004 which is very dissapointing considering the how good the graphics could have been, or at least a little bit better then 2004. I'm not saying however that the graphics are bad, i'm just saying they should have been better. The player models are pretty good as well as the court designs, they look exactly the same as the real arenas especially the Key Arena and Madison Square Garden Arena, they did a wonderful job with those.

One problem though with the graphics is that the players don't show that much emotion when they foul out/injure themselves/(they just hop around like kangaroos when they hurt their legs or they bend down a little bit and walk when they hurt their upper body or back)or miss a really important shot. I think they could have done a little bit of a better job with that aspect of the game.

Another problem with the game is that the team coaches look exactly the same, the only difference being whether they are black or white. Also the coach movements are exactly the same everytime he is talking to the team which can get very repetitive and g@y to watch once youve already seen it.

Overall though, the graphics in NBA Live 2005 are amazing and definetely not ones that you should complain to much about.

Gameplay: The gameplay in NBA Live 2005 is definetely the best out of all the NBA games up to date. There are way more moves that you can perform, more dunks and by far way more realistic. You can set your plays anytime you want which make this game very easy to work your way around.

One new feature about NBA Live 2005 is the all star weekend feature. It includes the following.

Dunk competition- A tournament to see who can bust out the best dunk. The better the dunk, the higher the scores will be that the judges give you. This can be complicated though, as you have to sometimes press a long sequence of buttons if you want a full 10/10 points for the round. The A.I actually plays extremely well in terms of difficulty, its not like their are consistently performing the same dunks over and over. Overall, a super fun gameplay mode to play.

Three point shootout- Another fun gameplay mode to play. where you basically take turns shooting three point shots from each angle at the three point line. Whoever makes the most three point shots in a minute wins. The only problem with this is that it is extremely easy to make the shots, you have to just release the shoot button just as your player reaches the height of his jump, not that hard, but definetely worth playing.

Rookie challenge- I personally hate this kind of mode. You basically just play normal five on five with rookies that can hardly anything. You minus well just play a normal 5 on 5 exhibition with real teams and real players, thats much more fun. Not recommended.

One problem with the gameplay i find in exhibition modes is that the A.I is quite stupid, frequently running out of bounds and not driving when they have the perfect chance to. Also, the teams aren't really balanced in terms of statistics. When it comes to the highest rated team, would you think of the Memphis Grizzlies? Didn't think so.

But overall, the gameplay is really fun except for issues with the A.I and that the rookie challenge is a waste of your time.

Audio: The audio in NBA Live 2005 is all rap. I guess that if you like rap, you will like the audio, but for those of you who don't, you will definetely play the game on mute. Also, the rapstars are very untalented and half of them i didn't even know about. For example, has anyone here ever heard of 5pound? Didn't think so. But stars like Young Buck make the audio listenable, but not great. Another issue with the audio is that most of the time when you first get into the game, it is the same song playing every time by Young Buck which i thought was retarded considering that he has no talent whatsoever in the rapping business, sort of like Chingy, but maybe just a little bit better then him.

Online play: The online play for NBA Live 2005 is amazing. The only problem with it is that you can only play online on a normal exhibition mode, not a three point shootout/rookie challenge/dunk competition.

But besides that its great. You can choose whether it is ranked or not, you can create your own private rooms inviting all stars or rookies, there are downloadable rosters, (sometimes to many) and you are able to use your communicator headset to trash talk your opponents when your winning which is really fun.

One other problem though with the online play is that it frequently lags which can definetely affect the game if your trying to get the most accurate of shots or shoot your free throws, where you have to be completely accurate. You also get disconnected quite frequently, but no where near the amount of disconnects that you get with Mortal Kombat Deception thankfully.

In conclusion though, the online play and the entire game is a huge success and definetely worth playing for all of you NBA fans out their, or even some of you that don't even like basketball, it is still an incredibly fun game to play when your talking about any terms, whether its the new features or the old.",The newest EA Basketball game is a hit!,1112400000,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

For some reason, this game got pretty mediocre reviews but for a launch title its pretty good. The graphics and sound are well done as well as the controls in my opinion. The game is a combination of arcade style racing and Gran Turismo style upgrading in a sense. You can buy and install upgrades for your cars although you don't see a difference except for paint or body kits. The main problem I have with the game is that the collision detection is shoddy and if you barely bump another car it sometimes skyrockets them forward while leaving you sitting there. Other times the computer cars seemed exceptionally good on certain races and downright stupid on others.

Or sitting on the mat and rowing with the ""paddle"" (wiimote) trying to get to the goal as fast as you can.

Like the Wii Fit games, it keeps track of your scores and the scores of others that play so you are constantly trying to beat your best scores and get top scores in the games.

Still, I went for it. The design is a little bulky but nothing obnoxiously so. It comes with the battery pack and a USB charge cable that you can plug into the back of your Wii system. The battery back goes into the battery compartment of the Wii Balance Board and the cable plugs in to begin charging.

At first, I had the same problems that other people have described. It made the Wii Balance Board get inaccurate weight readings. To be fair, I tried it multiple ways. First I tried it on my hardwood floor, both with and without the foot extensions, then on the carpet, then with the sleeve and then with the sleeve and mat, all the while switching things up to see if the battery pack really wouldn't work. I even checked if pluging it into the Wii USB  Finally, it seemed to hit on the right combination of being both on and off the yoga mat with the sleeve and having the foot extensions in (make sure the sleeve is put on AFTER the foot extensions or you'll get inaccurate readings)

In the end, it's been two weeks and the battery pack works just fine. I've never lost my connection between the board and Wii system (unless I stop using it a while and it turns off) and it records my weight within 3 lbs.

Overall, if the time is taken to make it work, it works great. I use the Wii Balance Board everyday and I am so glad I purchased the rechargeable pack. I am able to use it both free and while it is charging.

Lake Hylia is gargantuan, Death Mountain just towers above (though it does have a irregular shape) and as for Hyrule Field. well even on your faithful horse, it still takes a bit of time to reach one end to the other (try about fifteen minetes on foot). also, they managed to make the game lengthy (like nearly 50-70 hours of gameplay!). also, i have to say that since this is the first Zelda game to recive a teen rating, it might be a bit much for youngsters. if you have kids that are easily scared, then they should not get this cause the twilight relm is a scary place and there is a very dark story to the game but other then that i don't see how other kids can play. now, for my opinion i say the Wii is the way to go with this version. not only do you get the more realistic way of handling a sword and besides, its Wii. but if you don't have it, Gamecube also works. truly, Twilight Princess is a great swan song for the Gamecube and a great begining for Wii. so to see the birth of a brand new legend, Twilight Princess is the must have for all",the most anticipated game of the year is finally here!,1167177600,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

Initially, Two Worlds II did not impress me the way Oblivion did.  For some reasons, the developer went crazy with the bloom effect, causing the game to look blurry, compound to that is the blur motion effect which makes the game difficult and annoying to look at, much less play for hours.  Even after turning off both effects, the game still looks blurry, thankfully there is an in-game command line (engine.hdr=0) that allows you to turn it off, albeit you have to enter the command-line every time you load the game, but I don't mind.  Even though the game doesn't break any new grounds in terms of graphics and story, but it still provides many hours of fun explorations and addicting gameplay in a very immersive, beautiful fantasy world.  The combat system is more engaging than Oblivion, you get several powerful attacks to assist you in mele combat, and it's fun to see your character employs a one-strike blow to end the fight.  The game utilizes a complex magic system, maybe too complex for some to avoid it altogether, but it's very rewarding once you understand the basic of it.  Utilizing magic could mean the difference between a hard fight and an easy fight.  The system is based on the use of combinations of spellcards.  The different combinations allow for the creation of different spells, the stacking of the cards creates more powerful spells.  If you like to play as a mage, you will spend a lot of time experimenting with the magic system just to see the effect it produces.  I played the game on hard mode, a combo of warrior-mage, so initially it was hard, but as my character got stronger, the game got much easier.  You could play a combination of warrior and mage, and still do well on both.  The game does surfer from occasional bugs that exists in many other RPG games, but no freezing, no crashes and no save-game issues.

Sega took a massive gamble to even get this game made
The arcade version was a detailed masterpiece
This version is much different then the Arcade version

Anyone who's ever lucky enough to play the original Arcade version try it out

5.0,True,"10 27, 2011",A3RFV82ZZXG6UH,B0010AYJXI,Julia,"Next to Okage (look it up, it's AWESOME!!) this is my favorite game. And I have played a lot of games in my life.

**Sorta SPOILER** (sorta because it happens in like the first 10 minutes of the game and it's on the back of the box)

So, you are an author and someone else is writing your story for you and it starts to come true. I'm sure that sounds cliche. Like it has been played out many, many times before (in stories more, less in video games).

**END SPOILER**

But this game is far from cliche. It is unique and very intriguing. This game will pull you in instantly. It feels like you have been playing this game for a while, because you are just that into it right from the start.

I have yet to find a single flaw in this game. Not a single one. This is the second most beautiful game (graphics-wise) I have ever played and seen (Eternal Sonata is number one for me).

The controls are smooth and perfect, the weapons are fun and although there aren't very many of them it feels like there is a large selection (their strengths and weaknesses range greatly so there is nothing that extra weapons would add to this).

The maps are ridiculously large and free to explore entirely. The game heavily rewards people who explore every bit of the environment, too, because weapons and ammunition are in short supply and if you find a little chest that is hidden in some bushes, then you will be given a LOT of these items (weapons, ammunition, batteries (also very very important), and flash bangs).

There are side things to do, such as finding all of the thermoses or watching all of the televisions. They are tricky to find, but it is fun to see the creative places they are hidden.

The enemies say the FUNNIEST things. I laughed every single time one would sneak up on me. The first time I heard what one of them said, I was in a basement under some stairs, and one giant guy with an axe jumped at me (in slow-mo) from off the stairs, and he yelled dramatically ""omega-3 fatty acids are good for your heaaaaaart!!!"" Then they will also say ""fishing can be a hobby or a job!!"" So they basically just shout random facts, and personally it was really creative and made the game all the more special.

The environment is hard to maneuver sometimes because it is virtually always dark, but I feel like that was deliberate. It makes it creepy and more difficult.

I have never been more amused by characters in a game than the ones in here. They always had something funny to say. It lightened the mood of the game, as well, so that the darkness and depression of it isn't horribly overwhelming.

One thing that I had trouble with was using the weapons and ammunition. I would always try to save them because they were so hard to come across, and enemies sneak out of nowhere and swarm you. Do not follow in my footsteps, try to use them efficiently. Do not use them all at once, but every so often, you will lose everything you had and have to find more all over again. So what I recommend is playing the first part of the game multiple times until you see exactly how much ammunition and flash bangs you should use in one crowd of enemies. I died quite a few times because I was unable to figure out how to spread out the use of weapons.

The bosses were fun to fight and never repetitive. They ending was so thrilling (this ""ending"" I am referring to includes the location right before the final boss, too, because it was just so beautiful), and the story kept me playing it constantly. I spent all of my free time playing it.

If you don't measure out your troops to your citizens and follow through on advancements at the university and within all the other elements, the computerized opponent will come in and wipe you out. One key is building secure walls around your town as soon as you're able, so that the computer opponent can't get through (and repairing them when your opponent attacks). There are many different elements that you need to pay attention to throughout the game to keep on top of things, but that makes the game so much more intelligent and challenging than CIV III (and I liked CIV III too).

5.0,False,"12 22, 2015",A3BMSRC38L9AKV,B00Z9LUEGA,Particle Ghost,"Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel is set in a different part of the world as Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. Players take on the role of members of the Thors Military Academy in the Erobonian Empire, a place where social status is everything. The turn-based combat system is similar to what was seen in Trails in the Sky, where every character's actions appear on a list on the left side of the screen. You move your characters around the environment and take advantage of positioning and special attacks to battle multiple enemies at once or avoid incoming assaults. An important component of the combat system is your ability to manipulate the turn order.

I have received my game a little in advance, so I have had time to experiment with many of the games mechanics, and so far I have been impressed with the amount of strategy involved. Moving before enemies has a number of benefits; if you're smart about manipulating your turn order, you can go multiple times in a row. Additionally, there are special bonuses that you can get only if you attack on a certain turn. If you manipulate the turn order so your turn falls on a bonus square, you can turn quite a profit. This is made easier by S-Breaks, which you can use to force your character to take a turn. This is great for emergency healing or for grabbing a valuable bonus before an enemy can use it.

New to the franchise is the Link system, which sounds like Social Links in the Persona franchise. As you play, you build up friendships with the other members of the cast. As their friendships develop, they gain access to special techniques and abilities that they can use. Friendships can be used to assist each other's attacks, and higher levels of Link abilities grant more powerful bonuses, so building friendships can improve difficult battles. Trails of Cold Steel introduces some interesting changes to the core mechanics, such as the way your Orbment is handled. Rather than the semi-complex equipment upgrading from Trails in the Sky, quartz are now skills which can be equipped. You also have the ability to instantly swap characters in battle, so you're not stuck with a set party.

While the previous games were done in a sort of overhead view, Trails of Cold Steel is the first fully 3-D game in the franchise. This adds some interesting complexity to dungeon crawling because there are more ways to move around. Enemies appear on the battle map, and you now have the ability to attack them, Persona-style, to get bonuses. If you hit an enemy, you can stun them and run past or go into the fight with a turn advantage. Legend of Heroes also supports cross-play, so you can swap back and forth between the PS3 and Vita.

Final Verdict:

The new 3-D graphics look quite good, which really makes the game enjoyable to play, just don't go into the game expecting a ""Next Gen Experience"" after all, this is also a PlayStation Vita game. The Vita can still deliver great games, and the system is actually more powerful than the PS2, Just think of it as being a game from one of the good old PS2 days, while very fun to play, it is still inferior mechanically and graphically when being compared to triple A games we are seeing these days. However, a cool combat system, an interesting concept, multiple difficulty settings and some fantastic music come together to make it easily one of best treats for PS3 owners this year, as we reach the end of any new and creative games the PS3 may be receiving. I would highly recommend this game to fans of the JRPG genre, and its pure enjoyment to see one last strategy game added to an already robust PS3 library.

I would also like to add that I ordered the limited edition, and I must say that it is worth the extra $10, and I was shocked with the quality that I received. This collection is a pure embarrassment when compared to what big game companies are providing. It comes is a very nice case that is around 2 inches thick, and inside the box is an additional box that can be used for a future sequel, a pin, and a jumbo size art book that contains 141 pages. The book itself is in full color and is in superb quality waxed paper and its easily worth $25. The game is also very nice, and it comes with a reversible cover that is in full color, as well as a thick instruction manual that is also in full color. They simply don't make stuff like this anymore, and when they do, its far and few between and high dollar is normally changed for it.",A Nice Treat For Strategy Fans!,1450742400,33,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The main menu leads you to: play now (generic exhibition game), 2006 World cup, other game modes (practice, global challenges, penalty shootout). You can also check out video clips of all the German cities and stadiums in the actual world cup, but they're pretty boring unless you really like seeing trains move around through Stuttgart or something with really bad music in the background. Anyway, you can also buy certain things with points you earn in games like different balls, classic players (like Beckinbauer, but Pele is missing sadly), cheats, and uniforms (only for Germany, England, France, Spain, and maybe someone else... I forget).

On generic games: These are really customizable. You pick your team, opponents team- there are 127 playable countries, uniforms, half lengths (the default setting is fine), cheats, ball, starting lineups, sttadium, and a bunch of other stuff which I usually leave alone. The loading screen pops up with a fact about one of the countries like the fact that Liechtenstein has no female prisoners (!!!) and the World Cup records for the country.

The game starts and the countries national anthems play, but it's unrecognizable for whatever reason. I find that the game has the ability to be played like a real soccer game- if you want to lose. The real best way is to try to get on fast breaks so its 1v1 against the goalie, or run up the sidelines and cross it, and hope that one of your guys can head it in. The reason for this is that normal shots from far out don't work too well, because the goalies are too good. You can hit an absolute cannon to a corner and the goalie will dive and save it. However, if you get up close, the goalies are absolutely worthless and have a range of about 3... Yes 3, not 3 feet, but about 3 inches in the way they feel like flopping on the ground. But, for the most part it is fine, since in a real life situation, the player will almost always score in a 1v1.

On Practice: This is pretty helpful, but not really fun. If you start a game, and find yourself getting the ball stolen from you a lot, or you can't score, just go into practice, make the other team play shorthanded and try to make some plays.

On Global Challenges: These are historic scenarios from the World Cup or other cups/qualifiers. These range from absurdly easy to seemingly impossible. Be aware that you cannot change the difficulty. For instance, one scenario has you, New Zealand, attempting to score 5 goals in the final 30 minutes against Figi. This seems really hard, but it isn't, because Figi is made into trash in this scenario. You can run up with the ball and nobody will really try to stop you. Others like the infamous Australia-Solomon Islands are impossible. Solomon Islands is a terrible team, but they somehow have amazing skill in everything in this scenario. These scenarios are really fun overall though and give you experience with certain teams.

On Penalty Shootout: Easily my favorite part. It's just a penalty shootout, like the name would suggest. You pick the teams, and the order of the kickers and it starts. It's very simple with a power meter on offense with a little bar moving. If you fill up the power meter past the bar, your kick will miss (unless your guy has good accuracy, then you can afford to go a little above the bar). On defence, you move the analog stick to where you want the goalie to dive. These are really fun! Try to get yours to last as long as possible. Once, I had it so long that my goalie had to take kicks twice.

On World Cup: You can decide whether to use the actual world cup, or start your own. Pick a team(s) in a region and play in the qualifiers in the actual groups the world cup was in. I find that, generally, the same teams seem to qualify, so it's pretty accurate for the most part. Once you qualify (I always have), you will be sorted into groups and play in the World Cup! I have won with Spain in my first Cup, and I have just qualified with Cry-naldo and Portugal, and Israel in my second cup.

The game loaded with no problems whatsoever.  All my saved games were there.  The cutscenes were as beautiful as ever and still impressive more than 10 years on.

5.0,True,"11 18, 2013",A2KKXOPP3F46IC,B00DE2W4PK,Joshua,"The best feature about the PS4 is how fast and incredibly accessible it is. For starters, it took me about ten minutes to connect it to my TV, download the day one patch and install a game (Killzone) before I was playing.

Here are a few things I found after a weekend of using the PS4:

1. The IU is fast. Downloading a game from the store, getting in and out of apps and using the Share button is very quick. I know the few seconds it took to open things on the PS3 wasn't a big deal, but you'll definitely notice the raw processing power of the PS4 by just navigating through the menus.

2. The games look better, but also play flawlessly thanks to the Dualshock 4 controller. It's more comfortable, has a much improved texture over the Dualshock 3 and those extra features -- lighted sensor bar, touchpad and speaker -- add just enough extras to make it feel more like a separate device, instead of just a controller.

3. You're going to need an internet connection to really enjoy the PS4. Yes, you can play it without one. But the whole system revolves around constant updates like shared videos and screenshots, game patches and community activity, and of course the ability to download any retail game in the PlayStation Store.

This doesn't mean that you actually have to be social on the PS4, but the system has some great abilities to tempt you out of your shell.

4. The PS4 does make some noise. I'd say around 90% of the time it hums along without a sound. The other 10% varies from a slight increase in decibels to a flat out roar. I noticed it got much louder when the system was running a game from a disc, whereas a game that was downloaded onto the hard-drive ran much quieter.

However, it gets nowhere close to overheating. In fact, I worry much more about my PS3 slim than the PS4.

5. The launch line-up is stronger than you think. If you're like me and waited to get AC Black Flag, NBA 2K14, Call of Duty or Battlefield 4 then you won't be disappointed with the wait. Visual upgrades are all you're getting, but these are NEW, highly rated games that you can play Day One.

Knack is more geared for gamers looking for a challenge, not kids. It reminds me of Mega Man where the artstyle will appear to kids but the game plays much older. And Killzone's online Warzone will keep you busy for days.

6. Remote Play is great. It works so much better than the horrible PS3-to-Vita connection. I didn't test the distance, but it worked great around the house and outside on the deck.

I purchased AC Black Flag, Killzone, Knack and Lego Marvel. All new games that I get to enjoy Day One.

Conclusion: There are a ton of other bits of information that I could get into about the PS4, but just know that if you liked the PS1, PS2 or PS3 then the PS4 will seem very familiar to you. If you're looking to wait for a specific game to jump on the PS4, then by all means wait. Like any console launch the game selection is thin, but that will change over the next few months.

And to the small .04% of PS4 owners who are having trouble setting up their system, good luck and hopefully everything gets resolved! I own a Wii U and had similar issues on Day One so I know what it's like.",A Great Addition for PlayStation Nation,1384732800,,,

Some people imagine being a notorious criminal traveling around the globe while committing several crimes and living the life with all the money that they could ever want, plus some. They would be an outlaw on the run. That is what the Wild West has been described as in most fictional stories. Tough characters doing as they please and getting whatever they want are the center of these stories. Saloon fights and gun duels break out, usually over another mans honor. The Wild West may not be attractive to everyone, but it does have a certain level of excitement that attracts most people. Red Dead Redemption tells the story of John Marston, a former outlaw, as he roams Southern America and Northern Mexico. This is the only Wild West game, to my knowledge, to live up to the standards of the stories. Players are about to be engaged in a tragic tale of love, morals, freedom, and most of all, redemption.

What This Game is All About:
 Meet John Marston. He is a quite fellow with a dark past. At the start of the game, John is looking for an old acquaintance of his. Throughout the course of the game, he has to go through several different people, towns, and even another country, to find this man, and eventually more. The reason that he does this is left relatively ambiguous at the beginning of the game, and for the sake of preserving the well done story, I shall not reveal it.

 If Grand Theft Auto has been played, then this game would feel familiar, but it is not just of rehash of one of 2008s most popular games. The open-world feel is similar to Grand Theft Auto, but playing it in an open and barren landscape gives the player a whole new sense of isolation. There is no vocal music playing in the background, save for a few story moments. Riding through the land is peaceful and solemn, completely different than Grand Theft Autos rush hour traffic and long list of music on the many radio stations. That is just one of the many differences between the similar games, but there are more, so there aren't any worries for players who were worried about Rockstar, the developer, rehashing a 2 year old game.

Gameplay:
 Despite the differences, the gameplay does borrow heavily from Grand Theft Auto, but this is good. The games shooting mechanics are some of the best in gaming. The player can just tap the L1/LT button to automatically aim at a nearby enemy, and they can then freely aim and shoot. For hardcore players, the mode can be switched to remove this auto-aim helper. No matter which play style is chosen, it is still a very smooth shooting mechanic. Since I have not played Grand Theft Auto IV, the latest main entry, I cannot speak for how much has been tweaked, but rest assured, it is fine where it is at.

 Riding horses are a fun experience that a car just cant give you. This is one of the games biggest strengths and weaknesses. On the bright side, it makes the player feel like a real cowboy as they ride around. On the negative side, it gets old because of the sprinting mechanism. The player must constantly tap the X/A button for the horse to move. Granted, holding the button will keep the same speed, but it isn't nearly as fast as tapping. The horse has a stamina meter that cant be overused or he/she will throw John off. This will require the player to not only tap the button repeatedly, but to monitor the tapping. This gets old fast and is a perfect example of a small annoyance that can sometimes really detract from the experience.

 This game gives the player lots of choice, and although none of them drastically affect the story, they are a nice touch. Do I kill my employer and keep all of the money, or do I take my less than a fair share? There are also bounties that the player may accept to gain some quick cash. Fitting the theme of choice, the player can kill the bounty and make it easier on himself or herself, or he or she could take him alive with the trusty lasso and earn a greater reward. Here is the problem: the lasso is too buggy. Switching to the lasso requires the player to use the weapon wheel, which would seem fine at first. The problem is that once the switch happens, the lasso has to be aimed and thrown at the bounty, but he is usually already up and shooting at you. Given the fact that John dies in a few number of shots, this makes taking enemies alive a major annoyance. Some people might take this a problem with me being slow, but sometimes John doesnt even hold the lasso; hell just let go. Why? I don't know. Maybe I just got a glitch version of the game, but it made another minor problem detract from the experience.

 Speaking of glitches, those seem to be the main problem with this game. This game has more glitches than it should. Some characters will completely disappear during a cut scene, while some cut scenes will skip entirely. I don't care whether or not this is a huge open-world video game, which it is, it shouldve been polished more. The biggest crime of them all isn't even a glitch itself, it is just poor design; the physics of the game are atrocious. Ragdoll physics in this game do not work. John is just walking along and trips on a rock. The ragdoll turns on and he just rolls all the way down a steep cliff. The screen has reddened because of the damage, but then, a cougar attacks him while he is curled up on the ground. He dies. Why did he have to roll all the way down after tripping on a rock? Why did he let the cougar attack him? These physics are done horribly and disappoint me the most about this game.

 Being an open-world Rockstar game, there are a ton of side missions to do, and yet none at the same time. There are bounties, side missions that involve freak strangers, and even Poker. The Poker, Blackjack, and Liars Dice games are fun if someone likes them in real life, which I do, so I loved the inclusion. Only a short Poker game is required for the story, so the player isn't forced to play much. The Five Finger Fillet minigame is fun if someone likes hitting on-screen prompts in a rhythmic fashion, which I also do. The Horseshoe minigame wasn't all that appealing, but to each their own. The final minigame, Arm Wrestling, is okay; it requires the player to tap the X/A button at certain times during the match to wear down the enemy. Horse breaking is a quick money grab, but it is more of a diversion. These can be fun, but most of these can also get boring quickly, so it really depends on the player. For me, Blackjack, Poker, Liars Dice, and Five Finger Fillet were the best.

 The game includes challenges for the player to complete and unlock rewards. These range from killing 2 cougars with a knife, which is an awful experience because of the weapon switching, to collecting 10 of a certain plant type. At first, these are fun, but they grew old. Why do I need to collect 10 of a plant type? Shouldnt 1 or 2 prove that I can find them? These challenges are a perfect example of something added to just make the game seem longer.

 When the game is focused on battles, it is at its best. As mentioned above, the shooting is top notch. The problem with open-world games is that they usually have too much breadth, without enough depth. But hey, riding a horse while shooting bandits in sight is always a blast!

Story:
 The story is a tale of redemption. Although the reasoning isn't very clear at the beginning of the game, the player does begin to realize the tragic tale of John Marston. It is hard to describe it without revealing spoilers, so Ill just say that the third act, specifically the ending, is one of gamings finest moments.

 The voice acting is, as with any Rockstar game, fantastic. When the story feels like it begins to drag along, the voice actors still seemed to hold my interest, especially because of the well-developed characters. Although John does seem one-dimensional at first, his characterization picks up during the third act. Overall, the story is solid.

Design:
 The world is beautiful. Rockstar have developed fantastic graphics that depict the Wild West in a visually stunning way. The characters sometimes glitch and do animations that were not supposed to happen, or even disappear entirely, but that is expected in an open world game. Mostly, Rockstar has done a fine job in creating this world.

Sound:
This is my second big problem with this game. The game has a sense of isolation, which seems great at first, but after playing for 20 hours, I begin to wonder why a music playlist wasn't included in the game. This is why the game can get boring riding around after a while. However, there are 2 key moments during the game when music does play, and it is absolutely beautiful. It makes me wonder why Rockstar didn't have an entire track list.

Difficulty:
 The game has that average, normal difficulty. I only died during the course of the story a relatively few number of times. As mentioned above, the games glitches can sometimes kill me, but the actual difficulty level is just about perfect for my taste.

Replay Value:
 It took me approximately 39.5 hours to 100% complete the game. This really depends on the player. I would say that most of that time was well spent, so it has a fine replay value.

Final Judgment:
This game will probably be marveled at by most people for years to come, and it should be. I wish that Rockstar wouldve spent more time polishing the game and adding a soundtrack, but I cant expect perfection. This game is RECOMMENDED to anyone who wants a good story, the experience of being a cowboy, or someone to play Poker with because they are lonely.

Well in away it was but with a few more upgrades.  You can do everything that you can in the third one but now you can fly helicopters, pose as a police officer, get your own mansion etc...  A little ways into the game I thought this game is just like GTA3 and it started to get kind of boring then I passed the Diaz missions and got my own mansion then I found you could buy more property.  Each property has it's own set of missions that you have to complete to have them generate money and when you buy a piece of property guys with machine guns will appear on them, these are your guys (You get your own thugs!) the fact that you get your own thugs has to be one of the best part of the game.  Fast cars, your own thugs and a whole lot of explosions, who wouldn't want this game?
A side note, this game had two really awesome missions, the first was the Porn film studious bike mission, I think it was the last, you go into a building ride the elevator to whatever floor line up your bike and floor it out an office window.  If you were wondering why a large building would have a giant square in it well now you know.
The Second cool mission was the last on of the Malibu's Club, you have four guys and you all plan a bank robbery (Not much more to explain here).

5.0,False,"12 19, 2005",A3VN79B72XFDBK,B000AQE79E,op.wave,"Sometimes, very rarely a 3D shooter playes better on a console than it does on a PC. Well, it's not one of those times. As a matter of fact for those who have played a PC version of Quake 4, playing it on Xbox 360 will be a huge step down. Surely the HDTV graphics are there and overall the game looks similar to the PC version, but controls are again the weakest link here.

Well, since the opening was about the ""bad parts"" of the game, let's go ahead and get though them before we get to the ""good ones"".

Having played Quake 4 on PC, and deciding to be a hot shot by start the Xbox 360's verion right away on the ""corporal"" difficulty, I quickly realized how bad of an idea that was. Aiming is certainly something that takes a good time to get used to with a controller. But even after about 5 hours I was still no where near good at locking into enemies and strafe dodging shots as I was on a PC after only 10 minutes of play.
Surely by switching to the ""private"" difficulty I was able to get though the game with a relative ease but the excitement wasn't there. All underminded by the fact that 3D shooters are meant to be played with a keyboard and a mouse.

The graphics in this game while not ""Half-Life 2"" realism like, are certainly pretty. And if you enjoy watching people get cut in half with saws, you will certainly appreciate all the character, textures, particle effects (yes, blood) and lighting quality of this game. (On the same note, if you enjoy it TOO much, you may want to see a doctor *wink*).

The problem, however, lies in the inconsistent FPS (Frames Per Second). Many times FPS plunge into low teen numbers, making the game a slide show for a few seconds. It wouldn't have been a problem if that happend every now and then but frames don't stay consistent for more than a couple of minutes at a time. Combined with already hard to work with targeting system, it can bring pure hell in certain situations and quickly lead to death. Which then leads to perhaps the last big problem in the game - long ""loading"" times. Loading times can last in excess of 30 seconds. And although they don't appear often if you progress though the game (about once every 30 minutes), they can become enormously irratating if you keep dieing. In situations where it takes more than simply shooting at the enemy (usually boss fights), it may lead to situations of running into a room, getting nailed with one hit and looking at ""loading"" screen. It can test a patience of those who are not sure what they are doing and die in seconds only to look at spinning Quake logo for half a minute, over and over.

On the good side, however, the game is a well made 3D shooter from the point of level designs, overall graphics, and a relatively deep storyline for a what most would consider ""mindless shooter"". The story is easy to get into: Stroggs are continuing the fight against the human race. So as one of the marines you get dropped off on their planet to show them who the boss is. The missions are the ones that tell you story from a ""brotherhood"" military point perspective. You know that the war is going on, but inside the game it's more about surviving together with fellow marines. Assigned to the squad, you constantly on the move to help others, and AI (CPU controlled NPCs) do a surprisingly good job helping you as well. Which certainly takes away the feeling many other shooters give you that you are actually ""baby sitting"" the NPCs instead of working as a team.

Through out the game you get to know quite a few peronalities and spend most of the game fighting along side of them. Never knowing who will live and who will die. It isn't until you get deeper inside enemy bases that makes you understand why this game deserves a strong ""M"" rating. The images of graphical torture of captured fellow marines, blood and gore are everywhere. But what can you expect from a complex called ""Strogg's Medical Facility""?

The level and environemt designs are good, but at times can get a bit seamless. And the fact that many missions force you going back and forth though same rooms - certainly doesn't help. But it isn't significanly de-valueing the game overall.

There is a good choice of weapons in the game that get modified through out the game for a bigger punch. And there are a number of vehicles available for the use through out the short missions (usually outside). It seems fun but certainly nothing you haven't aleady seen before in other 3D shooters.

Multiplayer is pretty good and certainly adds a good amount of fun to the game. However, Xbox 360's version suffers from the same problems mentioned above. Where things like precise controls play bigger role than they do in a campaign mode. Making a PC version truly shine and leaving 360's version in the dust.

Overall, this game is an almost perfect example of what you would expect from ""big hitter"" companies like Raven Software and Id Software. But I wish they had taken a slight risk and tried to add something new to the game to spice it up and make it stick out from the rest.

PC version of this game strongly deserves 4.5 our of 5 stars. Xbox 360 version, however, is proabably somewhere in between of 3.5 and 4 stars out of 5. Mostly due to problems mentioned in the beginning of this review. One thing can be guaranteed is that you will have a blast playing it if you are into linear Gory, and Bloody 3D ""twitch"" shooters. The only suggestion here is to get the game for a PC if you have a powerful enough computer. If you don't, you will still have a blast on Xbox 360.

5.0,True,"02 16, 2016",A3HUH5BWEYVXGK,B00TUFUD0S,Vincent Vazquez,"One of my favorite games on the platform, Dragon Quest Heroes may be a different brand of Dragon Quest, but it's still a top-tier game in every way. Worth it for fans of the series, gamers brand new to the World of Dragon Quest, fans of anime, action-RPGs and action games alike, Koei Tecmo's Omega Force - the developers of Dynasty Warriors, Winback, Toukiden and Attack on Titan - have really delivered an awesome game to welcome the series to the new Sony hardware.

Dragon Quest Heroes is an action RPG take on the long-running Dragon Quest/Warrior RPG series. A spiritual successor to Omega Force's last (and quite obscure, it seems, considering so few people ever mention it in reviews for this game) action RPG, ""Trinity: Souls of Zill O'll"" for Playstation 3. A game that was solid and fun, but painfully lacking in the personality department. Well, that's quickly remedied by adapting it's design to Dragon Quest here, and then improving upon it further with more intense combat a la Dynasty Warriors (but much, MUCH better) and new, original elements all it's own! The game flow is built around a central hub that acts as a small town, with shops and people to talk to - it's here where you'll accept missions and sidequests and pore over a World Map (like any good RPG!). If you've played a title like Phantasy Star Online, Monster Hunter or Toukiden Kiwami, you'll be quite familiar with this setup. Once you assemble your party and your gear, and accept your mission, it's off to that level to do combat with scores of enemies ripped straight from the main RPG series!

And the combat is indeed the core of the game - good thing it's so well done! On a base level it resembles Dynasty Warriors as you charge into battle with 3 other party members against waves of faceless, easy bad guys. Add in special moves for your characters - and yes, like any good RPG, there is a skill tree with dozens and dozens of abilities and new moves/spells to add to your repetoire! - and the fact that everyone plays noticeably different with differing styles in the first place (REALLY helps cut down on repetition), and we're starting in a much better place than Dynasty Warriors already! The enemy types - owing largely to Dragon Quest as a series - are varied as well, so unlike fighting the faceless, identical goons of a normal Warriors title, the variety here keeps thing far more interesting as the game continually throws new monsters at you that provide a new challenge. There are also massive boss battles, stage specific gimmicks like Lava and Ballistas (Turrets/Cannons), and the Monster Medal system and the game's combat is well ahead of the dreadful monotony of standard Warriors games - and even better than Hyrule Warriors! The Friendly AI on your party is also MASSIVELY improved versus those games too - you'll definitely see your guys fighting well, keeping alive, and helping you out regularly. Such a welcome improvement!

What is the Monster Medal system? When you're slashing through foes and knocking enemies out left and right, they drop items like Health and Magic potions, but also occasionally they'll drop a medal with their face on them. Pick it up and it'll be slotted into an inventory on the bottom of the screen that can be navigated with the Dpad (up to activate, down to get rid of, left and right). Once you activate them, that enemy unit will show up to fight for you or deliver a devastating attack. So in addition to just killing everyone, this opens up some simple strategic elements, since you'll be able to create bottlenecks for enemy forces by dropping monsters in good places and then going off and taking care of business elsewhere on the map. It's quite satisfying! A great new wrinkle to brawlers in general!

All of this combines to really, really make the combat enjoyable, and the game design one of the most interesting Koei Tecmo has ever pumped out! It all launches DQH WELL AHEAD of any other Warriors game, or most other ""dumb action"" brawlers in general. Better than stuff like Transformers Devastation easily, for example. It's no DMC or Bayonetta, of course, but as far as dumber brawlers go, this is front of the pack. So entertaining!

The story is simple, but very effectively done with great voicework and endearing, likeable characters throughout. The music and presentation is also top-notch; this game is gorgeous. I know in Japan it's also out on PS3, but I can't imagine a nicer looking PS4 game at the moment. I mean yeah, stuff like Battlefront and Arkham Knight are technically more ambitious, but so much more boring looking versus Akira Toriyama's vibrant fantasy world. And this is without a doubt the nicest Dragon Quest has ever looked, and probably will until Dragon Quest Heroes or the PS4 version of DQ11 comes out. It's one of the nicest looking games to come out of Japan in a long time, period! It's technically accomplished and artistically strong - it makes for a charming, awesome looking game from beginning to end, which should last you anywhere from 40 to 70 hours.

I can't say more positive things about this. It looks fantastic, it bleeds charm effortlessly, it's incredibly satisfying to play... it's the definition of a 5 star review. Pick it up. If you don't like Warriors games, you'll like this -- it's easily a thousand times better. The RPG DNA is here and stronger than most action-RPGs, thanks to their prior experience with games like Toukiden and Trinity. It's a very strong showing for Dragon Quest's signature personality as well. It's just... just buy it you guys.

5.0,True,"02 12, 2011",AG2SZ238GJFZ8,B001IK1BJ0,Aaron,"Dragon Age: Origins was always one of those games I overlooked on the store shelves for months. Always assuming I'd just despise it because I despised Mass Effect.

Well, I had some money left on a debit card and thought ""what the heck"" for only 13 bucks..

The game arrived about 2 days ago and I'm highly addicted and slapping myself silly for not buying it several months ago. This may very well be the best RPG I have ever played, mixing elements of several different rpg genre's, like dungeon crawlers for example, or even tactical rpgs and yes, Oblivion.

However with that said this game very much stands apart from the crowd with superior gameplay as a whole, so don't get me wrong!

The world is beautiful, and sprawling. While not as huge as Oblivions or Fallout 3's, it is of nice size! You don't travel anywhere you want via sandbox style world though, instead you're offered a map of the world and can pinpoint where you wish to travel, from town to town, dungeon to dungeon, etc.

Combat is amazing. If you're a very involved and tactical player you can use the pause menu to lay out battle commands, queue potions, spells, etc. You can also take control of each person on your team on the fly, and use their abilities as you see fit. Furthermore you can customize how each member of your team acts when controlled by AI. For example, you can set your healer to automatically cast heal when an ally drops below 50% hp. Very very nice!

As far as Dungeon Crawling elements go, there are a TON of chests to be found, drawers to be opened, closets to be opened, and corpses to be looted. You can find rare weapons, armors, trinkets, etc, and of course standard gear as well. And yes, potions, and professions materials can be found as well.

Character customization is done extremely well. You can change every aspect of your character from the beginning. Hair, eyes, lips, nose, makeup, I mean everything. Also once you begin your journey your look changes depending on what you wear, which I love.

Characters also develop quite nicely in terms of skills and ability. You have very nicely structured skill/spell trees that you can develop as you see fit. For example, a mage may choose between a fire tree, or maybe an earth tree? you want to cast earthquakes or fireballs? and it's a lot deeper than I can even give it credit for being. You have a LOT of skill/spell options, as well as passive abilities, professions to choose from, like trap making, or herbalism? it's amazing.

The story draws elements from the standard RPG save the world from evil storyline, but it's set apart by EXTREMELY well written dialogue and personal choices that effect the story deeply in some cases. It also has very nice plot shifts, and a TON of side quests that in most cases, further or add to the story on the whole. And make no mistake about it, the character development is done SO WELL in-tune with the story, that you WILL care deeply about the characters in this game!

Now in my opinion, the overall game score is laid out as follows:

Graphics = 7. Not as good as say, Oblivion, despite being a newer game.
Sound = 9. The music is beautiful, and my only gripe is some of the combat music can become tedious.
Overall Depth = 10. The game play, options, story, everything is absolutely wonderful!

5.0,False,"08 19, 2014",A2SA6LR78V49UV,B00CV5ZNFO,OrangeCrush,"I wound up buying Terraria based on a recommendation of a friend. I had initially written it off as some sort of Minecraft clone and to be perfectly honest, I think I am one of the only people in the world that do not really care for Minecraft. I just have a really hard time getting past the low resolution textures and graphics. Anyways, one of my good gaming freinds told me that while it did have similar aspects to it, that of building and resource gathering, it had many aspects that made it very different from Minecraft. I am a big fan of 2D sidescrolling games in general so I decided to take a chance and bought it on Xbox Live Arcade. I basically spent the next week completely immersed in this game.

For those unaware, Terraria is basically a 2D sandbox style exploration game. One of the best aspects to Terraria is the world is randomly generated at the start of the game. This type of randomly generated world/dungeon is becoming more and more popular in the gaming world and for good reason. It significantly adds to the replayability of a particular game. Terraria does have many things in common with Minecraft. Like Minecraft, the heart of the game is exploring, collecting materials, and crafting an ever increasing number of items available to you. You start off in the forest, but Terraria has many different biomes with which to explore, each offering unique items with which to craft with. By the time you get 8-10 hours into Terraria, you will already have a large number of items that you can create, including various types of armor and weapons. One of the best items in the game is the rocket boots that one can craft. They allow one to traverse long distances in quick measure. Not to mention, its just fun flying around in rocket boots!

One of the biggest differences between Minecraft and Terraria lies in the fact that combat plays a much larger role in Terraria and that is ultimately one of my favorite asepcts about the game. On top of there being enemies galore, all over Terraria's map, you also have the added bonus of multiple boss monsters that one can summon at certain points in the game. The big eye you see on the XBox 360 Terraria box art is one of these bosses, The Eye of Cthulu. The bosses are definitely challenging, especially if your playing the game solo. Playing Terraria with friends is definitely fun, but I actually prefer to play solo a lot of the time as its a much more challenging game when your going it solo.

There is a small tutorial at the beginning of the game that gives you a basic idea of the games mechanics and how you go about collecting resources and building items, but its short and not very in depth. That actually wound up being one of my favorite aspects to Terraria, the fact that it just basically throws you into the world and you have to really figure everything out on your own. I can see where this might annoy some people, but I absolutely loved this aspect of the game. Slowly buy surely you learn more and more about the world of Terraria. Its just makes the whole exploration aspect to Terraria that much more exciting. Another interesting aspect to Terraria is the NPC's that populate the world. There are NPC's that will come and live in your shelter, but only if they have thier own furnished rooms. There are various NPC's, each offering various services including healing, selling items, etc. It definitey adds incentive for creating a really nice home base.

If there is one aspect of Terraria that I found disappointing, its that its completely void of any sort of story or quests. As amazing as Terraria is, it would have just been that much better if the game actually had a story and quests. Personally, I think that is the next step for this genre, adding a story and various quests. A Terraria styled RPG, one that had a story and quests, now that would be an absolutely amazing game.

Bottom line - While Terraria definitely has a lot in common with Minecraft, it is most definitely not just another Minecraft clone. Terraria takes some of the best aspects of Minecraft, adds its own unique qualities, and ultimately creates a completely different kind of crafting/sandbox style game. I had serious doubts about wether I would enjoy this game, and then I wound up sinking like 100 hours into it in the first couple weeks alone. If you enjoy sandbox style games  or games that have exploring at the center, then I highly recommend you give Terraria a try. Its one of the best games I have played yet on Xbox Live Arcade.

Intro:

The game starts out kinda slow. With limited things to do and limited battery life. (only 80)

The good part is it is very easy to get more battery upgrades by collecting happy-points.

There is a toothbrush you can pick up not long after you start the game, which is for cleaning stains on the floor.

Every stain cleaned gives you 2 happy-points. Not to mention when you've cleaned a certain amount of stains you get a point bonus, usually 20+. You can also pick up scrap paper, candy wrappers, cookie crumbs, etc. By throwing these in the garbage can in the living room (I haven't been able to locate another one yet) you get even more points, not to mention Moolah, the games currency. Using Moolah, Chibi can buy things from the Chibi-PC in the Chibi House (located in the living room).

I'll tell you the coolest thing I've found so far (which I've bought) is the Chibi-Blaster.

Using it Chibi can blow through cracks in the walls to reach new areas and blast through spider-webs.

Most importantly, you use it to fight the little robotic spiders that appear randomly. Known as Spydorz.

However, you don't need to worry, they appear only after you've purchased the Blaster.

Defeating them leaves behind scrap metal which you can use to build Utilibots.

One is a latter which is very useful for reaching high places. Another is a Warp. Very handy for moving up and down the stairs in the foyer. (Which takes forever to do on foot.)

And yet another is an extendable bridge. A little bridge that unfolds that can reach far away places you couldn't get to other wise.

Exploring in the game is very fun. The games day/night cycle lets you explore during the day or the dead of night. Making even old areas seem different. Initially, you only have 5 minutes before the day or night ends and you have to return to your Chibi-House. However, from your handy Chibi-PC (once again located in the Chibi-House) you can purchase extensions. The first allows you to take 10 minutes instead of just five. The third, 15. It doesn't sound like much, but it makes a big difference when exploring.

Chibi can climb a number of things in the house as well as interact with other things. (Such as speaking to the toys that come alive at night.)

As mentioned early in the review, the battery can be annoying. Not enough to make the game repitive or anything, but you really need to keep an eye on your battery meter! Don't worry though, again as mentioned before the upgrades are fairly easy to get. I've went from 80.0 power to 160.0 since yesterday.

(The upgrades are in increments of 20).

Falling from high places though can spell Chibi-Robo's end. The end of his battery that is. Falling drains battery power significantly. If you take a fall and it doesn't drain Chibi completey, get to a plug-in, quick! It's not a catostrophe if he does die. It can be annoying. You have to start back from the Chibi-House plus you get Moolah taken away.

However, you don't need to worry about falls if you utilize one of Chibi-Robo's most important tools.

The Chibi-Copter. After equiping, hop off a high place to glide gently and safely down. You can also hover horozontily for a few seconds by holding A.

Review:

Graphics: 9.0

The game's visuals are awesome. From the details in the house to Chibi himself, the graphics won't dissapoint!

Sound: 9.5

As were the graphics, the sound is amazing. Always there, but never annoying.

It's very creative how they made a different tune play depending on what Chibi-Robo's doing.

Gameplay: 8.5

The gameplay is excellent. I don't know about the replay value though. Which is why I only gave it 8.5.

I would think I would want to play it again though.

Overall: 9.8

As close to excellence as you can get Chib-Robo is a game that I will remember and play for a long time.

The challenge is to kill only the target without alerting the other NPCs. Stealth in Hitman does not mean only hiding in the shadows and going from point A to point B in a mostly linear path hiding from enemies and executing a sequence of events. It has a very open format - kudos to the makers. How you complete your objective is up to you. It involves hiding in plain sight which can mean disguises to reach close to the target, knocking out guards using anesthetic, sniping from afar but making sure no one see you, engineering accidents, planting bombs near the targets to either distract or kill. All these can be used to complete a level in multiple ways or used in conjunction on the same level. It can also be pure stealth - learn the movement patterns of the NPCs and steal around them. Just one more point, you also need to escape. So if you go in close and do not succeed in a clean kill, the guards are alerted and you may not be able to escape.

Blood money is the best of the lot in the sense that the number of ways to complete the missions are virtually unlimited. Hitman 2 is the most realistic and also the hardest but again with multiple ways to complete. Note that the aim is to get the ""Silent Assassin"" rank - the highest achievable - and that is not dependent on any particular method. You can also KO or kill anyone you like in any manner you see fit but that can affect the rankings. Also each mission can be completed in less than 15 minutes and games who want to challenge themselves do it in less than 5 minutes or even less - all with the highest ""Silent Assassin"" ranking.

Note that Hitman is not a action/shooter game - there are others that do it a lot better. It is also not a stealth game - Thief comes to mind which was pure stealth and where you lost if even one NPC saw you. Hitman is, well a game about being a Hitman - a Silent Assassin - for want of a better term. :)

I am now officially a fan of the series after playing Hitman the first time more than a decade ago and writing it off as a wannabe stealth/shooter game (it was all splinter cell and thief back then) and not giving it a second look.",Hitman is not a stealth/action game... it is however a very intelligent one...,1364774400,4,,

Monopoly for the PC has been out for some time, so I don't know why the complaints about how this ""isn't Monopoly"". What's so exciting about regular Monopoly that take hours to play?

This game is fast pace and cut-throat. I can just imagine what the multi-player is like. Being that I haven't played that yet, I'll just stick to the single-player. It has the familiar game pieces (as their 3D representative character) and blocks. The premise is similar, but with a twist. Instead of hopping around a board via die roles, you pick a block and start building. The single player gives you progressive challenges each with 3 difficulty levels. You only need to complete the easiest level to progress to the next. You also have railroad and utilities that you can buy in some scenarios.

In single mode, you are pitted against 2 computer challengers and get scenarios such as ""Be the first to make $2,000 in 1 day of business."" This is where the ""sim"" comes in--you're not only building a wide array of shops, you're trying to build what will draw the consumers and shut out the competition. You poll the people in the neighborhoods near where you want to build to find their desires, which change over time. Fill a block with businesses and take it to auction--if you outbid the others, all of your stores get free rent/utilities for a period of time so that your bottom line grows. The game starts in the 1930s but ever 1 ""day"" is a five year advancement in time and you gain the ability to build new business that weren't available in the previous time period. Fads come and go so a store that was popular in the 1940s may not be in 1960s. That's okay because you can renovate and change the type of business it is.

If it sounds like you get bogged down with all this, don't worry, you don't. You don't have time as it's very fast paced. Building is a matter of choosing a business type and dragging the mouse over x-number of squares and it zooms to completion immediately. The larger the building and/or the nicer the frontage, the more it costs. You can also sell off businesses that aren't doing well or change them into a different business. You have day businesses and night ones so you have to pick your building time well. Money comes in from customers, but goes out when it's time to re-order supplies and pay rent at 6 a.m. Also, you want to keep an eye on your cash levels and those of your opponents so you can send your block to auction at the best advantage for you.

Like the traditional Monopoly, you can get ""Chance"" cards, some good, some bad. No passing go or landing in jail, though. One thing that's a neat touch is that the music changes to the appropriate period as you move through the decades.

The only things that can be frustrating is the auctions--the characters can be tediously the same. (If you decide to quit the auction, you can click a button and speed up the pace. I wish it would just do that itself instead of bidding continuing to come from the computerized opponents.) The other thing is that it takes you through specific challenges--you're not just allowed to play a regular multiplayer against the computer (at least at first--I haven't finished all of the challenges.) The scenarios do help you get started if you didn't do the tutorial, but it would be nice if you could pick and choose which ones you want to play instead of forcing you to complete each challenge before moving on to the next.

All in all, they've kept true to the idea of Monopoly, but have given a new spin to an old game.","No, it's not ""regular"" Monopoly--it's better!",1005868800,43,,

They smell bad, they drool, have terrible dental hygiene, steal the jobs of hard-working dwarves and gnomes, and of course...they eat people. Or so I was told. (*Mild Spoiler*) You can imagine what a shock it was to learn in Warcraft III that not only are the orcs not enemies; they are allies you need to save humanity's collective bacon. So as you play the game, you'll need to drive that Lord of the Rings propaganda out of your mind and find peace with your inner orc.
Warcraft III is a terrific real-time strategy game that goes farther in blurring elements of role-playing and strategy than any game that's come before it. The inclusion of heroes as role-playing characters is terrific and provides extra incentive to explore the entire map because you never know what items or quests are hidden in remote corners. It just makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside when you find those hidden magic boots or that ring of protection. Warcraft III also marks the best story to date for a Real-Time Strategy game. In the third campaign of the single-player, I tell you that I was an orc...for about an hour. It's also worth mentioning that he tale cleverly unfolds in a way to allow you to play each of the factions (Human, Undead, Orc, and Night Elf) in a compelling progression.
Anyone who has played RTS games before will be familiar with the interface and gameplay of Warcraft III. All of the usual unit types are there--it's just that in Warcraft III they seem more polished than in other games. Whether it's the endearing signature responses when you click on them or the way the units intelligently form up, move, path find, and attack, every aspect of every unit has obviously been thoroughly tested and balanced. Not once when I gave an order did a unit wander off from the pack to explore some random corner of the screen and cause me mouse-crushing, game-cursing rage (see how well I found my inner orc?). It may not sound like much, but those of you who have played many real-time strategy games know that this is not a given. When I ordered a unit to march to a certain place and kill, they did just that.
I realize that the game is over a year old now, but it's worth noting how technically sound this game is. I did not have a hiccup in this game. Not once in my single-player campaign did the game crash to desktop, freeze, stutter, spit or delay. The load times were very reasonable and there were also no graphical problems changing resolution or color depth. The graphics themselves are probably the weakest element of the game; all of the units certainly look very blocky and dated. But of course, for a real-time strategy game, who really gives a crap? You don't need state of the art graphics for an RTS. I certainly didn't find that it affected my experience.
I only played the multiplayer a couple of times and I got stomped like the kid in my elementary school who used to wear cardigans that looked like they'd been swiped from Mr. Rogers' closet. It was that bad. This game has been out long enough that even if you seek out a so-called newbie game, you're dealing with people who obviously eat, slept and breathe Warcraft. But there was no problem finding a game and I didn't have any problems with lag or people bailing out of games. It just so happens that I stink.
On the whole, this is a beast of a game: fun to play, compelling, balanced and technically sound...and I think it's time we thought about an orc for president.","Orcs are friends, not goons",1075507200,15,,

The different colors or paint/ink you can use are beautiful and I love trying to cover the enemy team's turf with my paint insteasd of theirs.

 Online battles or turf wars are great and only last a few minutes each so don't have to sit for long periods of time just to finish one match. This was a problem I had with games like Left 4 Dead and sometimes had to exit a game because I just didn't have the time to finish. I really love that you can earn experience to gain levels and add abilities to your clothing such as being able to run faster or farther. You also unlock more weapons the higher your level raises. All clothing and weapons can be purchased from one convenient place in your little squid town.

Story mode is wonderful as you start your adventure as Agent 3, a squid kid on a mission to save all the Zapfish from the Octolings. The final boss was great and had just the perfect amount of challenge. Although story mode is great I find myself waiting impatiently for every Splatfest because they are the best part of the game in my opinion.

Graphics: Very good.  Framerate is solid, the new 3D models work well (hair and clothes flapping in the wind), and as usual the graphics do a good job of conveying the breathless action.

5.0,False,"01 3, 2006",A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000APZ40G,David Foskin,"Another year and another wrestling game, you'll think to yourself when you pass the video game aisles of your favorite electronics or game store. Yet for the past few years THQ and Yuke's have been putting out WWE titles for the PS2 that have been getting better and better and it wasn't until SmackDown! vs. Raw that we have seen a game wrestling fans could really sink their teeth into and enjoy. Well, that was last year because SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 is here and believe me when I tell you that this is, by far, the best thing to happen to wrestling since The Rock stepped foot in the ring.

Not just a new roster change (although unforeseen changes, like the tragic loss of Eddie Guerrero, have not been rectified at the time of release), this 2006 edition just adds more features and a better grappling system while bringing back many of the things we loved the first time around. You'll still find a stable filled with favorite Superstars from the long list of top male grapplers (The Undertaker, Cena, Sean Michaels) as well as the lovely WWE Divas (Trish Stratus, Torrie Wilson, Stacey Keibler) and also some legendary grapplers like the '80s Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold Steve Austin and even The Rock among a few others.

Aside from the usual assortment of match types like Ladder, Table, Cage and Tag Team matches (with Manager or without), there's the new Buried-Alive match where you'll slam your opponent into an actual casket and slam the lid closed. There's even backstage brawls where you'll be able to Irish whip your opponent into environmental objects. The Bra and Panties matches are back but it comes back in the form of Fulfill Your Fantasy Mode where your favorite Diva can dress up as a school girl, nurse or French maid as they rip clothes off each another. There's even a Divas pillow fight!

The best game mode by far, though, turns out to be the game's Season Mode. It is here that you're encouraged to create your male grappler (complete with a choice of different voices) and take him through a full WWE season. At the start of your career, WWE Diva Torrie Wilson's friend and General Manager, Teddy, is hit by a car in the parking lot of one of the arenas. Suddenly the accusations begin to fly and there's finger pointing between your grappler and the oh-so dreamy Cena. During these accusations that you'll find a number of choices and depending on what you pick you'll be challenging different opponents. It is here that you enter matches and participate in WWE events to earn points that unlock some really juicy extras in the game`s new Locker Room. It's a lengthy affair and one of the most enjoyable Season Mode the series has produced thus far.

If you're interested in the wheeling and dealings of a WWE GM, there's General Manager Mode that has you coming up with your own roster of Superstars, taking charge of your stable's finances as well as deciding on matches and who will turn on who the following week. This is really a great peek at what goes on in the WWE. The game's Creation mode also has a nice number of options and with the new Create-An-Entrance, your created wrestlers will truly feel a part of the WWE lineup.

The game's grappling system has been tweaked and it borrows its best elements from the GameCube's WWE Day of Reckoning series. Pulling off some complex moves - even turnbuckle moves that were a bit difficult to pull off smoothly - are handled with ease and thus make the matches even more exciting. You'll counter and reverse moves a bit more easily but there's a price to pay. Much like Day of Reckoning 2 there's a Stamina Meter that, realistically enough, wears out your grappler. It makes sense, really, since you can't dish out punch after punch without showing signs of fatigue in real life. When your stamina runs low, you'll have to tap the Select button to regain strength. It slows the action down but not to a frustrating degree.

On the visual front, SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 is a gorgeous PS2 game. This year's game sees some sharp graphics with characters that look amazingly like their actual counterpart. Aside from Hulk Hogan looking a lot like Hulk Hogan, the game makes use of motion capture to make each grappler walk, bust moves and receive punishment realistically enough. The arenas look alive with fans and each type of venue is decorated accordingly ... even the game's overall presentation feels like a televised event. Sure there's still a few clipping problems that see hands going right through your opponent's flesh, but it never gets too out of control.

The game's sound offers a surprising new addition: voice acting. You'll actually get to hear your created character during Season Mode's various cutscenes. You'll even hear a number of your favorite WWE Superstars like Cena and Torrie just to name a few of the colorful characters you'll meet and challenge. There's also match coverage from the same two-man commentary duo that handle real matches. The commentary they make really doesn't offer much of an insight nor will they offer true play-by-play but instead begin to bicker and playfully insult each another much like they do in real life. The Superstar introductions are true to the televised events and that's a great thing. You'll hear every Superstar's theme music playing loudly and there's some tunes from artists like Ministry that play throughout the game.

There's no doubt about it, SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 is truly this year's must-have wrestling game. Period. It not only looks gorgeous but also it plays just as good as it looks and with new features and a brilliant Season Mode, you'll find it hard not to give into a game that's worth your hard-earned money even if you bought last year's great game. Buy it right away if you're a fan of WWE wrestling or have been looking for a nearly perfect wrestling game for your PS2.",WWE Smackdown! vs RAW 2006,1136246400,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

But a few things: if you're buying for PS3, sometimes the save data gets corrupted and makes the game freeze and stuff, and you'll just have to delete your save data and start over. Crowd reactions are messed up, the crowd pretty much boos alot (in Universe or Exhibition mode) and they hardly cheer, and if you're fighting like, lets say Hulk Hogan John Cena, CM Punk (I think he sucks) or the Rock, and you're playing as a Created Superstar, the crowd will just boo at you. Stupid. The game has occasional glitches, like superstar's limbs get bent out of shape and other things, and they can be very creepy.
One other pet peeve of mine is that in Universe mode is takes FOREVER for your CAW to get a very good crowd reaction- it doesn't matter what they accomplish or anything. Like- let's say 20 time WWE champ CAW still gets booed when he is dominating a match with lets say John Cena.

5.0,True,"04 25, 2010",AH4NVZ8XSGOHY,B0014UGK4U,Ken,"I've had Red Faction: Guerrilla (RFG) on my wish list for several months now.  It looked different than most games I play, so I decided to experiment and give it a try.  Before buying, there was the pesky matter of deciding whether to get the XBOX 360 or Windows version.  I have a fairly high end pc (Win7 64bit, i7 920@ 3.5Ghz, GTX 295 video card), so I decided to enjoy all the eye candy I could with the game.  The reviews are less than stellar for the Windows version (some mention failures to run on Win7), but I'm not scared by such talk.  I was talked into the XBOX version of GTAIV and regretted it after seeing it on Windows.

Installation was pretty straight forward and took 10 or so minutes to finish.  Upon completion of the main installation, it wanted me to install a chat client for gaming.  I went ahead and installed it since I planned to try out the multi-player features of RFG.  I haven't tried the multi-player portion yet, so I'm not sure if it is needed or not.  This was followed up my the game asking me to enter the serial number for activation (yeah, DRM stuff, but I don't care).  I entered the serial and fired up the game.  RFG uses Games for Windows Live, which is fine by me since I like trying to get the max amount of achievements I can.  I also don't mind being connected to the internet all the time because I'm not some crazy conspiracy theorist that is so paranoid of the internet that I physically unplug my cable modem when I'm not using it.  I already have GFWL installed, so I was all set there.  I fired up the game and GFWL also asked me to enter the serial number. GFWL found the latest update (from early April) and asked if I wanted to download and install it.  I accepted and closed RFG while it was downloading and installing the update.  Upon restarting of the game, I was able to start a new career and get going right away.  What ever problems they had before this patch in regards to Windows 7 64bit have been fixed.  I haven't had a single crash after 26 hrs of game play.

Gameplay is pretty straight forward and if you've played any GTA titles you will feel right at home.  Basically, you're job is to avenge your brother's death by killing all the EDF you can to liberate Mars.  This involves blowing things up, which is cool.  The perspective is in the 3rd person, which some folks don't like very much.  Control can be a little annoying when using a keyboard and mouse, so I just use my Xbox controller with this game.  So much like GTA, you have a few different styles of missions to complete.  You have primary missions, guerrilla actions (free hostages, defend site, attack site, carnage), transporter (steal vehicle and deliver to a safe house) challenges, and demolition master challenges to complete.  This gives you a nice variety of stuff to do while trucking through the campaign. The one major complaint I have about the game is there should be more walkers lying around to hijack.  They are a blast to use during assaults since you can flip cars like nothing and watch them start chain reaction explosions that send enemies and debris flying all over the place.

RFG uses the HAVOK physics engine and the GEOMOD 2 destructible environment graphics engine.  This combination results in a pretty intense and surreal experience when blowing everything up that you can get a demolition charge on.  The graphics are actually quite good...for it being on Mars.  There aren't trees everywhere, so the main eye candy in the game are the vehicles and explosions.  The vehicles are highly detailed and animated (especially the walkers).  Driving physics is very complicated and often frustrating due to the fact you can't steer when you're front tires are off the ground (duh).  Realism is where the Windows version shines.  It's very clear when watching videos from the PS3 version that they had to dummy down the physics for those ports.  The transporter help videos showed the vehicles not really bouncing around in response to the terrain.  It was very difficult to beat the Pro times for the achievements on transporter and demolition master challenges.  The downside to this technology is it clearly needs a near top of the line PC to run at near 60 frames per second.  My PC was a perfect match for this game, providing consistent 55-60 fps throughout game play.  One feature I thought was cheesy was the low quality cut screen and mission briefing videos.  These looked like they came from a computer game from 1998.

Overall, I was very happy with RFG.  It is probably one of the most addicting games I've every played.  It can be very repetitive, but what game isn't?

  First you are in a prison ship, why you are there is never explained but that hardly matters, apparently the Emperor just threw you in prison(?). but your Shipmate talks to you for a little while and then you pick your name, then a guard gets you and you head outside, there you pick your race,Gender and look of your characetr from a near endless list of cool choices (Dark elves are real cool, couldn't resist). then you head into a census office and choose your class, my favorite part, customization is half the fun in this game, you can make your character literally ANY kind of class you can think up, or you can pick one, but the real fun Lyes in making your won class where you pick your skills, name of the class etc, i love this part and anyone who always wanted to be a Demon hunter or something can just make it. then you pick a birthsign which dictates some major or minor abilities and stats you recieve, then you are released into the huge world of morrowind with just the name of a contact in Balmora, heres where the game really kicks off, you can explore ANYWHERE from any part of the game, on foot or in a silt strider (Giant pasenger bug) by boat or teleportation, the huge island you're on is Giant, your characetr can by equipment and accessories, weapons and armor and learn spells, they actually appear right on your character too unlike some console Rpg's. leveling up is fun and easy and ive been playing for a logn frickin time and still haven't even completed the first main mission. thats the beauty too, you aren't limited at all, you can join several different guilds and complete their quests orbecome an imperial guard and do empire work stc. you could play for as long as ypou have the game and never even crack at the main storyline, the island is littered with dungeons and towns too with miles of ruins stretching in vast mazes underground. this game world is huge and your totally customized character is in the middle of it all. characters react thoguhtfully too so if they don't like you or are Racist (in full force here) they won't like you and will say rude comments as you walk by. that brings me to my next point, the graphics, voice acting and sound is brilliant with great music and incredible piel counts, enviorments are brought to life in this game and characters look pretty realistic, guards also patrol the streets, so if you like some open-ness with your RPG cake then definately, by all means, BUY THIS GAME! it will hook you and never let go.",A great game with some minor flaws,1044403200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

For the sake of genre label its a platformer which shares the likes of Metroid in which your character powers up in terms of health and abilities. This series actually has roots back to Gameboy Color.

This game isn't a recycle either and has changes which make what overall is an improvement. First and most noticeable is the departure from pixel art style to hand drawn which to me is really pretty and sets a different kind of look and feel to it. It really does feel more magical and fantasy like. Instead of pirate gear for abilities, Shantae has transformation magic. A magic meter is added for what used to be attack items you had to buy in previous game along with using it for some dances that use magic. I found it better especially since its improved with access to different styles of the magic to use such as fireballs, tri-fireballs to flamethrower from its fire category.

I found exploration alot more convenient and faster in this sequel along with better structure in layout. For example the town in the previous game felt much more stretched out and time consuming to travel through. In this one everything is conveniently in one area and on ground level, result is less back traveling. Another thing I noticed is this game feels soo much easier and  map areas things such as hidden areas are much more in plain sight so you don't overlook it and miss something.  If the game being too easy is a complaint to some they do have hero mode after completion just like TPC had for those seeking  more challenge.  Overall this game is very satisfying and I hope to see there is more from this series.

Version 1.00 was what I started and finished it on and to my completion I had only had 2 game crashes occurring. Both times the game crashed was when the character died, other than that the game was very stable and smooth running. I have not tested dlc since its not available and I think if your game didn't come with it it should help reflect the score since alot of games are now INCOMPLETE, BROKEN and RUSHED. Most times companies try to screw us over by seeing how much material they can CUT from the game and try to sell it back to us, a horrible practice indeed along with obsessive fans who troll and deceive consumers out of blind loyalty and mentally ill obsessions with companies aka the ""fanboy"".

I will say that it does feel short, I would have liked to see extra maps or other nice extras like outfits alternative endings etc. At the time of my review there still was no dlc available.",Shantae delivers again!,1483747200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8172sD4bXrL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AeQWlD+4L._SY88.jpg']"

The game is done in the style of an animation, has plenty of chances to die if you mess up (so save directly before if unsure) & is a combination of talking to learn new bits of information &/ or make allies (which can occasionally be directed in different ways via yes or no responses) & logic puzzles. I suggest getting this with, at least, the manual, unless you know how to play. The manual tells you how to solve the first puzzle step-by-step so you can absorb how the game basically functions. Of course, understanding how the game is supposed to work doesn't help too much if the character doesn't respond correctly or there are partially obscured items that are necessary to grab or interact with to progress, but that is rare & there are always tutorials on Youtube.

This adventure does not have a boring moment.

Impressive and fun gameplay because it has easy navigation & an intelligent story that keeps you wondering what is next.

5.0,False,"08 25, 2009",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B001E8VB3C,Tsanche,"Video games haven't been too kind to Batman.  Often times when we think of a Batman game, the first thing that comes to mind is that the game just isn't going to be all that spectacular.  What is it about the Batman that hasn't always worked in the past?  It's hard to point out.  What we can point out, however, is that Batman Arkham Asylum doesn't fall into that category.  In fact, it is easily one of the best Batman games to be released.  From its humble beginnings, the game is fine tuned video game that does most of what it does incredibly well.

Let's begin with the production values.  This is by far one of Arkham Asylum's strong points.  The game begins with the Joker being caught and taken to Arkham Asylum, but he seems to be pretty non-chalant about it, and Batman doesn't like that one bit.  And it turns out he was right to be suspicious.  The Joker springs a trap and Batman is caught in the middle.  Now he's trapped inside the Asylum with the Joker controlling things, as well as several other adversaries.

One of the nice things about Arkham Asylum is that it presents its story very well.  The art style feels comic book like, but it doesn't skimp on the overall visual presentation either.  There's a lot of artistic flair and technical goodness to behold with the graphics.  Most of the environments look fascinating and will really draw you into the game.  The tone is perfect.  The other good aspect is the voice acting.  If you remember that Batman: The Animated Television series you'll be surprised to see its the same voices.  Kevin Conroy is Batman and Mark Hamill is the Joker.  And the voices are done very well.  The production values of the game are absolutely stellar.

Of course, a game just isn't much if it only goes off of visual flair alone.  In the past gameplay seems to be one of the areas in which Batman games often stumble.  In the past the games have had a hard time crafting together good gameplay elements or sometimes being unreasonably clunky.  This is mostly Batman's past.  The games sometimes felt rushed.  This isn't the case with Arkham.  In fact, the game mostly keeps things pretty simple.  The combat is really easy to pick up on, having you string together simple combos.  But the game hardly devolves into button mashing.  This is because your enemies will take advantage of the situation, and the game makes sure you can't rush head on into things.  First and foremost, most of your foes are willing to take advantage of their surroundings.  Second, you can't go head to head with several enemies all toting guns at once.  This is definitely not a beat 'em up kind of game.  In fact, in some areas, caution and stealth are required.

There has rarely been a Batman game where you actually feel like Batman.  In some places you'll be able to swoop down and leave your enemies hanging from gargoyles... or perform a glide kick or use some of Batman's gadgets to get the job done.  For such simple gameplay concepts, there are actually quite a few ways to implement them into the game.  The game also lets you upgrade and improve on your techniques as you progress.  So there actually happens to be quite a bit of variety.

At the same time, though, the game is accessible to just about everyone.  You can also enter what's called ""Detective Mode"" if you so choose.  Within this mode, Batman can see certain things he otherwise couldn't.  You can tell where your enemies are easier and find some hidden goodies.  You'll no doubt be playing a large portion of the game in this mode, but it's very worth it to do so.  Choosing not to means missing out on some of Arkham Asylum's secrets, and there are a lot of secrets.  The most prominent of which is that you can find riddles scattered all over that will unlock lots of different things for you to do.  You'll also be able to unlock small character bios and audio samples about certain characters.  These are other things that really make the game come alive in its own way.  And in the midst of all this, the game doesn't appear too challenging or intimidating.

That's not to say you won't be challenged.  You will.  Particularly when you reach something new.  It's nice to know, however, that the game isn't overly difficult.  It's just to say that when trumping through it at least doesn't feel easy.  When helping you get acquainted to things, Arkham Asylum is pretty easy going.  But once the game takes away the training wheels you may find yourself hitting a few snags every now and then.

The visual look of the game isn't all that adds to the game's atmosphere.  So does the music and so do some of the animations when you're fighting.  Sometimes it's fun to battle just to look at some of the animations as they take place.  Other times exploring can be absorbing because the music really knows how to set the tone.  Arkham Asylum has a lot of strength, but the game seems well aware of just what those strengths are.

There's really not much that keeps Arkham Asylum down.  In many ways it's exciting to play a Batman game that's good.  After getting several Batman games that felt like a throwaway of the license, Batman Arkham Asylum feels like a breath of fresh air.  Most of its gameplay conventions have been done before, but it's mostly how the game mixes them together that works well, and the absorbing atmosphere it emits in the process.  Batman fans might find themselves pleased by this one.  It's a simple game to play, but there is definitely a lot in it that could keep you busy for some time, and a lot to explore.  It's great to see a Batman game come to fruition, and to do it so smoothly.",The Dark Knight Finally Gets a Game That Does Him Justice,1251158400,90,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

5.0,False,"02 5, 2015",A2BECB6NN30NAT,B00D2ZK1IG,Courtney L. Osborn,"Have you ever wanted to play in a zombie infested wonderland?  No?  I have.  Techland gave me exactly what Ive always wanted in an open-world zombie game: streets filled to the brim with zombies, loot everywhere you turn, terrifying zombies that only come out at night, a fun upgrade system, and an enjoyable story that explains why the zombies are where they are.

Dying Lights story is a fairly simple one.  You play as Global Relief Effort (GRE) undercover operative Kyle Crane, whos on a mission to recover some important data somewhere in the fictional city of Harran, which happens to be overrun by zombies.  This of course doesnt give you a whole lot of reason to care about whats going on, as you don't know what the important data actually is.  However, throughout the first few missions of the story, due to the GRE acting stupid over the radio and Crane figuring out that there are still humans in Harran that need help, he decides to take matters into his own hands and help the people instead.  Players will see the gradual change in Cranes heart as the story progresses, making them actually care what happens to many of the characters surrounding him.

It also doesnt hurt that Techlands writing has vastly improved since their previous games in the Dead Island franchise.  While I did enjoy those games for their zombie-killing fun, the writing always felt bland and just there to move things along.  Kyle Cranes personality was shown beautifully through the writing (and Roger Craig Smiths excellent voice acting).  Players get to see him struggle with the reality of whats going on in Harran, mourn the loss of new friends, grow to hate one of the local faction leaders, all while still keeping his sense of humor in tense situations.

What really surprised me about the storytelling in Dying Light was not its main story though, it was the level of detail in some of the side quests.  Of course, just like many other games, Dying Light has its fair share of vague fetch quests that are only there for the sake of keeping players busy.  But if you can look past those, there are some truly amazing and sometimes even hilarious side quests available.  One quest called Mothers Day has players running an errand for a man that requires you to pick up a movie and some chocolates for his mom.  Turns out, his mom has been dead for a long time and he has a bunch of pillows tied together on the couch, pretending it is his mother.  Like WHAT? I laughed hysterically during that quest! There are many more instances throughout the game that are just as fun.

Dying Light also showed a huge leap forward in Techlands graphics.  Gone are the days of blurry, poorly textured environments.  It looked beautiful throughout the entire game.  Their experience shows even more if you have played Dead Island when you realize that there is literally no slowdown when s*** hits the fan.  Dying Light constantly throws hordes of 20+ zombies at you, requiring you to either swing your weapon like Billy Butler swings his bat (at every pitch, it doesnt matter if its a strike or not), or run like a mad man to get away.  If this was Dead Island, players would experience huge framerate drops as soon as things got crazy.  Thankfully, thats not the case as I never once experienced any framerate issues.

My one complaint is that the farther I got into the game, I experienced more texture popping.  It was weird because the first 30 hours I played Dying Light, I never had an issue.  But as I got into hours 50-60, each time a level would load there would be some pretty bad texture popping for about five seconds.

But who cares about a good story, funny side quests, and pretty graphics!? How was the gameplay? AMIRIGHT!?  Good news! Dying Lights gameplay is incredibly fun! I really mean that too.  All joking aside, Techlands decision to add parkour into the game was a fantastic idea.  Dying Light sets itself apart from every other zombie game by giving players the ability to sprint, vault, jump, swing, roll, etc. to their hearts desire.  This made traversing the huge city of Harran extremely fun, and made me not even care that there wasn't a fast travel option.

One issue I started having later on was using the grappling hook.  It was extremely touchy about where you could and couldn't grapple to --  meaning that if you made the slightest mistake, rather than grabbing the ledge and continuing your romp through Harran, you would fall miserably (and hilariously) to your death.

Aside from the parkour element being fun, Dying Lights combat was also very satisfying.  While its a simple system (collect melee weapons + swing melee weapons = kill zombies), I never got bored.  The slow motion kill cam and the deep upgrade system made every bout with my undead enemies very enjoyable.  Dying Light was also one of the few zombie games that come to mind where staying as quiet as possible is extremely key to staying alive.  So what if you have a kickass police rifle? The second you fire it into a crowd of zombies, you will have alerted the strongest and fastest zombies in the area to swarm to your position.  This made the zombie experience feel as real as Ive always imagined it would be.

The farther you get into the game, Dying Light starts throwing new types of zombies at you. Each has its own different strengths and weaknesses, meaning that you have to learn to adapt on the go in order to survive.  While it can be frustrating to run through a house, only to have a bomber zombie step out from a closet, killing you instantly when it explodes, it quickly teaches you to be a little more careful and pay closer attention to your surroundings (a valuable lesson).

The day and night cycle is another cool feature in Dying Light.  Traversing Harran during the day is a cakewalk compared to doing it at night.  Zombies become much more aggressive and special super zombies called Volatiles only come out at night.  Volatiles can take an extraordinary amount of damage, even from the highest level of weapons, and they are able to deal out damage really fast, so its better to just never be seen by them or never let them catch you.  My first time playing at night (the mandatory story mission) left me never wanting to play at night again for fear that I would have a heart attack.  It took me nearly 15-20 hours to finally attempt a night mission again.  Of course, the more you play at night, the more you learn and the easier it gets.  But that never stopped it from being a heart-pounding experience.

The Verdict: 8.9 out of 10

Dying Light is the zombie game Ive been waiting for.  The variety of zombie types, enormous difference in difficulty between day and night, deep upgrade system, enjoyable story, and funny side quests made it an unforgettable and addicting game.  I am 100% on board with what Techland has started with Dying Light, and have high hopes that it continues as a franchise.",A Near Perfect Zombie Experience,1423094400,12,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Ok so the graphics aren't as good as CoD4 but the gameplay and sound alone justify my opinion.

 The sound is the greatest sound fx I've ever heard in a game, I think it should actualy be considered a crime to play this game without suround sound. When you are inside a building as always you can hear your footsteps but the depth to the sound quility is amazing and when you fire your weapon it echoes so beatifuly it makes you feel like you are really in that hall.

 The Frostbite engine allows for almost endless distruction which alone makes the game more fun then CoD4 (which I was a huge fan of so please don't think I'm bashing it at all). If there is an enemy behind the wall blow it up to get to him, don't feel like using the door blow it up or drive threw it with the tank!!! You can even go as far as using this feature to blow out a roof and turn the attic into a sniper location.

 The game is insanely fun and has hilarious commentary from squad mates. I only got play the multiplayer for a few minutes but it is the same setup and style as CoD4 making it easy to get used to. I highly recomend this game give it a shot regardless of if you think CoD4 is and always will be the greatest first person shooter ever...

Why SEGA I mean no offense but all they really do is release old games inworse format. You all remember Sonic the Hedgehog right, That game is one of the best oldschool games ever made. It was relitivly simple too, all the controls where was, Jump-Charge-Forward-and BACK. THAT was practicly it. It was simple and it was fun. But SEGA has a way of ruining old time favorites. I used a friends copy of SONIC and the RINGS I think it was called for Playstation 2. I never died so many time in the first level of a game in my life. I did not know what to do. I mean now it's all 3d, and you have to charge here, jump there, punch this dude, fall here, dodge this, paint that, drive that thing, pick this up, fly over there, die, reado it all, get mad, yell why, do it again die again, return the game and play this. In four minutes that was all I accomplished. I can honestly say I have not played a single game from SEGA that I can think of that I enjoyed in the past 5-10 years. I mean thay have not realesed any systems for that time either. So why MARVEL WHY. Why did you not sign with Vivendi.

Anyway this game I have no complaints about besides the fact that you can only knock down a handfull of buildings. Everything else is PERFECT. The supermoves are awesome. I am sorry but I think that after playing this game, HULK WOULD SMASH SUPERMAN. He would kill his face. I mean the dude throws cars like their pebbles. I got to throw a 10 tonn demolishion vehicle like 6 miles. He PUNCHES DOWN BUILDINGS. I love how you can pick up a civilian an just flick'em. Or you can pat them on the head. I love how after you beat he game you can run around the cities smashing everything as BRUCE BANNER. It was quite funny to see this little tiny dude pick up a twelve foot mech and pile drive him, and then face plant him into the ground, then beat him to death with a bus. I think that they could have made DEVIL HULK a little cooler, but he is still pretty bad@$$. The abomination was cool. I love the fact that he can flip a tank over, spin it around and throw it like it's as light as air. I love how you can slam the ground and make cars fly up in the air and fly off into the distance.

All in all this is by far my favorite game for any system. I hope that thay consider doing a second one, and the same for ULTIMATE SPIDERMAN.

When I started playing I just could not stop. To be honest I'm kind of glad I'm done I was spending way to much time with it lol. Now I can go back to playing the games I normaly play, fighting from SSFIV to King of Fighers 98 UM I am a fighting game fanatic! Anyway enough with that on to what I thought of the game.

This game manage to do something GTA 4 did not do hold my attention.  You knew that comparison was comming. Even though this game is known for its over the top nature the story missions are anything that you would see in a GTA series. Escort somebody here, protect this, go in a building a shoot everyone up you get the picture. The story presented itself in a pretty realistic way. The game goes crazy with the side missions. I don't want to get into them but the fight club, fuzz, drug trafficing and property damage was some of my favorites. If you never played a side mission and stuck to the maing story you would see this game a s being fairly serious. Being able to customise your character was fun. I liked being able to make a sexy woman causing all this mayhem. Usualy its a guy you see doing this stuff. Making a female character was a nice change of pace. The one major downside was how many times this game crashed on me. This game would crashed just about everytime I played it in the begining. That is completly unexceptable. I can deal with some glitches, like the one where my car got stuck in the road for no reason and I could not drive. But, the game just crashing no thats pathetic. The timing of the crashes was the worst. I had a tendency to crash after I beat a mission, right before the game would load back up it would freeze. Turn system off, redo the the mission over, that sucked.

Despite the flaws off the game it is really fun. For me atleast it managed not to get stale. It is not a five star game, but I enjoyed it so much I game it that high a score. Gta 4 managed to take itself way to serious and managed at times to be stale instead of fun. It got boring so I just quit playing. This game I could not put down.

Story: now set in the late 1960's across the world, 12 years after the events from the first game. Crypto is still the president from the ending of the first game and you play as another clone of Crypto. The KGB join the Majestic as antagonist and the KGB blow up the mother ship in the beginning. Orthopox is now a hologram throughout the game but still guides you through the game. Your goal is to stop the KGB from destroying America but you soon realize that the real threats are not from the KGB or the Majestic....

Gameplay: You travel through areas around the world trying to take down the KGB and Majestic. Several characters and locations are parodys of characters from fictional stories like James Bond, Godzilla, etc. You have humans that help you throughout the game including a sexy KGB woman named Natalya. Some new features now include body snatching instead of using a hologram, your saucer can camouflage for a short time, your abduction beam now is used as a gene blender to give you upgrades, and you have a ""free love"" ability that makes the world forget they saw you. You get a few new weapons as well. You still chase down the red and green containers from the ship and you even get detectors for them as you progress so you can back track through the levels and find them all. Your saucer can be called to any landing site you come across so you don't have to back track to find it. Lots of side quests and a fun continuation of the story. The areas are large and the missions are fun. The ending is a shocker that you will enjoy.

persona 3 SE had an art book, and a music soundtrack from the game.
while none of those things are here, we have a plethera of new additions such as New Personas, The Epilogue Chapter (which plays like a game in itself where you are the the protagonist, (Aigis), leave behind most of the really cool school elements for this and get more dungeon exploration aspect. it works well for this game with hours of added gameplay and content. 70+ hours in Persona 3 (yes comes with it unaltered, other then new personas, Events and Hard Mode) Plus the Extra  NEW Chapter ""The Answer"" with 30+ extra hours of gameplay for a total of 100 Hours of gameplay!!!
 this a must have for persona 3 fans that may or may not have persona 3 SE or are thinking about FES well, think no more! FES at a mere release price of 29.99 makes this package a true deal for newcomers to the persona games and to veterans alike. Veterans I recommend a rental if you have SE unless a HUGE fan and have to have it but for fans Grab this title NOW! before it is out of print!
I must also point out that while this game does a great job with the school aspects of the gameplay and while not as interesting (or annoying depending on your point of view) as they are in bully where each class is a mini game, here we see only a single question needing an answer and a correct one givin raises a stat such as charm or academics. I liked the way they didn't bog down the game with the school aspect and slowly lure you into battle. the old school turn based battles feel a little fresher here with the strength/weakness system of combat. I really am impressed with this title and would recommend it to every RPG fan out there.

Graphics: anime style flair and Excellent artwork 5 Stars.

Sound: unusual techno metal soundtrack cool sound effects Excellent Voice Acting 5 stars.

Overall: a blast from the first time you see the persona gun go off and your persona comes forth, you will be hooked into this game like me and I Strongly recommend looking into the rest of the series. with all the bonus content I can not help but Give this title 5 Stars! (sad No soundtrack this time)

5.0,False,"10 28, 2005",A1HLMUUJN40MJT,B0000ZUGZ4,Brian Pletcher,"Sierra does what no one could have expected.  They pulled out a winner that could very likely be competeing for PC Game of the Year in the Shooter market.

To start with Sierra has had a past history of hit or misses and I being a fan of Tribes 2 decided to give this game a shot.  After playing the Demo I bought the game on release day.

To say the least I was impressed and the game ran REALLY smooth on my system figureing it's not the best in terms of tech.  I run a Athlon 64 3200+ with one gig of RAM with a Radeon 9600 SE Video Card and so far have not ran into any slow down issues.

The game upon Installation (Be sure you have space cause installation requires nearly 5 Gigs of Hard Drive Space) and starting up the game it scanned my system and optimized it to get the best performance it could and so far I'm VERY happy with the settings.

To say the least this game deserves the Mature Rating so parents be wary of buying this game for kids.  It contains alot of gore and liberal use of foul language in this game.

The physics engine within this game along with the AI was DAMN impressive.  You hit loose objects and you can move them with ease.  The ambiance of the music (Very Dark) along with accidently hitting an object sets the mood for this game.  The AI I just have to rave about.

The enemies are smart.  Smarter than anything I've ever seen in a game to date.  Enemies will run for cover behind pillers or whatever they can hide behind upon coming under fire, knock over shelving to block your way to them and call for backup and if a grenade is seen being tossed yell and run for cover before it explodes.

Physics of this game is impressive.  The guns actually utilize some form of physics that does not allow you to just aim and hold down the trigger and expect your automatic machine gun to stay on target.  It holds a kick that will gradually pull your weapon off target so it forces you to fire in bursts which is realistic unlike other games.

While I have not ""Finished"" the game I'm far enough along to say that this game has done nothing but knock my socks off.  The game consists of gunning down enemies utilizeing tactics and the enviroment of the building to your favor along with simple puzzle solving tactics.  The worst you have to do is find a few switches, levers or Computers to allow you to further explore a level.  Some exploreing of ducts is required as well but otherwise that's the extent of the exploreing.

The huge system requsites are the draw back but it's a minor one figureing if you're a HUGE PC gamer you most likely have a good enough system to play most of the current games.

Overall if you're a Halo fan you will most likely enjoy this game and it dows offer a multiplayer option to play online once you're tired of the single player but fair warning that if you play the multiplayer expect some fast kills on populated servers.  The Multiplayer holds up to 16 people and I played on full servers and deaths were being handed out very fast.

You should not be disapointed with this game.",F.E.A.R,1130457600,3,,

The depth and immersion that this game provides is still years ahead of what has been produced. For a title released in 2003, I have yet to play another game which is as realistic as OFP. The graphics are somewhat dated, but the lighting effects and overall atmosphere is very true to life. This game can be replayed over and over, with enemy AI responding differently every time. You can choose to execute the missions any way you can, and you have to often resort to your creativity and resourcefulness to get them done. What I love about the game is that the map/world is enormous. If there is a mountain that looks miles away, you can go there. There are virtually no boundaries. There are still many mods available which have excellent custom missions and soldier mods such as those put out by Ballistic Studios.

That game was WayForward's Sigma Star Saga. Little did I know this wasn't your typical RPG. You know, the kind with turn-based battles and whatnot(i.e., Golden Sun, Breath of Fire, Final Fantasy). This game mixes together an RPG with an R-Type style space shooter. Sigma Star Saga is an adventure that tells the tale of two warring factions and the human that tries to bridge that gap between them. The story, itself, is rather entertaining, engaging, and humorous at times. As far as the game is concerned; it's full of exploring, solving puzzles, advancing the storyline, picking up items and blasting through levels of enemies. I commend WayForward & Namco for taking a risk and trying something new with the RPG genre.

For the most part, Sigma Star Saga's gameplay works. While I'll go on record as saying it's a good RPG worth spending some time on; I will warn you that, at times, the battles get pretty monotonous and repetitive. When you'd like to do more exploring instead of battling, you can't because the game practically forces you to see the battle through to the end. That is my biggest gripe with the game. Course, I'm making leeway into the meat of story now(Patience is the key, I guess) but it is rather annoying at times.

Looking past that, Sigma Star Saga is a lengthy RPG with a very entertaining story. While it's no Final Fantasy or Golden Sun, it's still an original concept that should be commended. If you're into RPGs but are looking for a little something new and fresh, then Sigma Star Saga is right for you. While this particular type of game really isn't my cup of tea, as I'm into more traditonal style turn-based RPGs & Strategy RPGs, it is entertaining enough to me to see it through.",Sigma Star Saga.....,1136764800,5,,

+ Simple setup
+ Excellent sound quality
+ Long charge life

CONS:

- Not 'truly' wireless for the PS4.
-----------------------------------
The main things I look for with gaming headsets is ease of setup, headset quality, and clarity of chats during game sessions. I'm glad to report that Turtle Beach's PX4 headset surpassed my expectations in each of these areas.

EASE OF SETUP:

 - I'm the guy who can't plug in a toaster the right way unless I have detailed instructions. Turtle Beach must have known I would be reviewing this headset, because the directions couldn't have been any simpler to follow. They provided screenshots of the setup screens for the PS3, PS4, and multiple versions of the Xbox 360. If I can connect this, anyone can.

HEADSET QUALITY:

The earpieces were very comfortable, and the mesh kept my ears from feeling sweaty during late night Destiny raids or Netflix marathons. I thought the detachable boom microphone was a great idea, it doesn't get in the way if I don't want to chat.
The charging cord for the headset is 13 feet long, which makes it easy to charge the headset whether you're playing a game or watching movies.

Speaking of movies, I was recently watching 'Radio Free Albemuth', and there was a segment with low-level music which I didn't hear during a previous viewing without these headphones. And of course, I tested the headphones with movies such as 'Tombstone', 'The Matrix', and 'Watchmen' - all of them sounded excellent with no audio popping or dips in sound quality.

The 15 hour headset charge claim held up - I was able to watch 11 episodes of The Blacklist on Netflix and the sound didn't cut out at all.

CLARITY OF CHATS:

From the get-go, this headset provided me extremely clear chats for all my gaming sessions. I could hear other players without any problems, and they could hear me just fine. No crackling, no cutting out, it was clear as crystal. I could increase or decrease the game volume as well as the microphone volume with a turn of the dials on the right earpiece, or the Talkback cable for my PS4, and it couldn't be simpler. The voice commands for the PS4 come through loud and clear through the microphone.

CONS?

The only drawback I see to this headset is the need for the PS4 Talkback cable. If you're looking to use chat features or Playstation voice commands, the cable has to be connected to the controller, so this headset isn't completely 'wireless'...but this is a minor point.

FINAL THOUGHTS:

I feel this is definitely worth the price. It's easy to set up, the sound quality for games and music and movies is superb, and the long charge provides uninterrupted entertainment sessions.

If it's within your price range, I highly recommend this headset.",Perfect for late night gaming sessions or Netflix marathons!,1415491200,55,,

Note: There is a bug.  I had a few occurances during play where the screen froze and had to restart my system.  I'm playing it a second time around and have not come across this bug, BUT it helped me figure out a strategy for success.

There are special icons that perform special functions (i.e. green vial removes all tiles of the same icon), to play a game more sucessfully, you can watch the screen load, decide if the special ability is something you want (green vial, lightning bolt) and if it is, continue to play the screen. If the special ability is something useless (i.e. rain drop  / increase time) then pause the game and select restart level.

This strategy also works for more complicated screens. Play the screen till you get the special ability, pause, restart level and the special ability  obtained previously will be on the restarted level. Play partial games with different special abilities to accrue them, then play a level using all of the special abilities you acrued.

5.0,True,"12 27, 2012",A1APW6OQQER0SR,B00136MBHA,User,"This game is a very different experience.  If you are thinking about this game because you're a fan of other Square Enix RPG's, you need to be aware that this game is a very different animal.  The setting being a real place, trendy clothes instead of armor, delayed effect single-use items, and ""random"" encounters completely under your control make this a unique game.  Character personalities are fairly typical, but they each have an interesting back-story to them.

The actual gameplay is as different as the backdrop.  The map is big enough that it doesn't feel small, but not so big that you won't have a vague sense of how to get where you want to be.  Armor and weapons are replaced by clothes and pins (think flair) and their relative effectiveness is dictated by their brands.  Certain sections of town like certain brands, depending on what shops are in and around there and how much you use certain brands in that area.  There are a ton of items, plenty to do after you beat the game, and it has decent replay value.

On the subject of uniqueness, the combat is bizarre.  In combat, you control the main character and his partner simultaneously, but they appear to be fighting in different spaces on different screens.  The main character is controlled by the stylus on the lower screen, and the partner character is controlled on the top screen with the directional pad.  The main character uses the pins.  Each one does a slightly different thing and is controlled in a slightly different way.  Again, you control both simultaneously.  This is not as difficult as it sounds, as a key combat mechanic is to complete a combo with one character and then complete a combo with the other character.

In summation, this is a very fun game an you won't play anything else like it.  This is the best use of the two screen system I've ever seen.  The combat is odd, but sounds much harder than it actually is.",An Excellent Surprise,1356566400,5,,

First Impression: I was a little bit overwhelmed. You see, there is a lot of stuff you can't do when you're first starting out. So I felt like I was never going to get it done, or it was going to be impossible to do something. But after you play through it, and get more gadgets, things start to make more sense.

Combat: Great, and easy to jump into combat. The moves are cool, and they change a lot, so it never feels like you're doing the same move over and over again.

Stealth: I love the stealth aspect of the game. There are a lot of things you can do with stealth. You can fall from a gargoyle and rope a thug up, walk behind them and take them out, hide behind various objects, go under tiles in the floor, all kinds of great stuff.

Story: Well, I haven't finished the ending, but the Story isn't as good as the rest of the game. I may be wrong after I see the ending, but for now, the story is okay. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's just not inFAMOUS' story.

Challenge Maps: So far, I've played a little as Joker, some of the Scarecrow DLC map, and regular Challenge Map. They are fun, and worth the spot on there. Just give it a shot and see.

Length: Unfortunately, I've only spent about 12 Hours playing it, and as I said, I'm already near the end. I've been doing a lot of Riddler challenges, so, I'd say straight through story would only take about 8 hours. I know, it's disappointing, but cheer up, the Challenge Maps and extras give you some more to do. It's way too much fun to be judged solely by it's length.

*SLIGHT SPOILERS*

There are some things you might want to be aware of. Many times with Scarecrow, it will seem as though your game has messed up. Especially the final encounter, when the game actually freezes, and starts glitching the screen. I thought my game was screwed up, and I was upset. After awhile, it DOES fix itself, BUT. It starts you at the very beginning of the game. Or does it? It just makes you think that. Very clever, Eidos. You fooled me. And you deserve props.

*END SPOILERS*

The atmosphere of this game is very dark, and mysterious. As is Arkham Asylum. It's a lot of fun to play, and a good purchase.

The single player RPG genre is almost abandoned by game developers, why?
Well, we all know the answer, after Blizzard's World of Warcraft big sucess, all game companies are in the market of the MMORPG.

And many, many players of those single player RPG games were to play those MMORPGs, with the goal of experience a new way in the RPG genre.
The first months all is great in MMOs, you can play online with friends, chat, trade & sell in the AH.
Leveling your avatar/char in a MMO is a great experience, yeah, but when you reach the max level, the fun is over. Why?
Because now you have to do the same raids over and over and over until that item with probability of appears of 0.001% appears and you have the luck in the rolls and win the item. If you lose in the rolls, the complete run in the raid is a waste of time. And also you have to deal with guild's GMs with some kind of God complex, really jerks.
So in a nutshell, any MMORPG in the max level is = kill N mobs in a raid + have luck in the rolls.
And you wonders to yourself, WTF?

In the single player RPG, you are able to change the world and the adventure in each thing that you do.
In a MMORPG, you can't change the world, no matter what you do.

So here is the big question:
play more MMORPGs where you only have to kill mobs all the time and have luck in the rolls?
or
play more single player RPG like Dragon Age: Origins where you have to think and set the strategy in order to achieve the victory.

There are a ton of missions with a lot of variety.  There are CGI cut scenes between many of the missions as well.  You can also make choices throughout the campaign that effect your gameplay without effecting the linear plotline.  Some people saw this as railroading, but I think it's a fun way to add some customization.  Battle.net is a breeze to use and the multiplayer capability adds years of replayability.  Lastly, the graphics are top notch and fluid.

Are there any downsides to this game?  After playing it for hours on end, I really can't find any.  Sure, it lacks some features from the original Starcraft, but it's 2011, not 1998.  I still think it's a terrific game that you'll have fun with.  You'd be hard pressed to actually hate it.

I was actually able to wear them for abour 3 hours straight playing Overwatch with my friends the other evening. There was not one point in which I needed to take off the headphones due to discomfort.

The second thing I wanted to talk about was the sound quality provided by the headphones. Both the sounds of the game and the voices of my friends came through clearly. The basses are deep and the trebles are crisp and high, and I was overall very pleased with the sound produced. I am a stickler for sound quality, so I can pretty confidently say that if I am happy you probably will be too.

The build seems fine. They aren't made out of concrete, so be aware that you probably don't want to try to bend things in a way that they weren't intended to. The mic swings down to be next to your mouth, and can easily move right back up if you want it out of your way. The cord is nice and long and splits into a mic out and a sound out at the end. But in the box an adapter is included so it plugs right into your Xbox One S controller. On the cord is a little piece that lets you control volume, or mute the microphone.

Overall these have been a very good purchase for the money. I've actually started using them to play games even when I am not using the microphone to talk to friends. I find it to be immersive when playing, and the wife does not have to listen to all the screaming and guns blazing.

5.0,True,"07 30, 2015",AG57VT9BSYL25,B007699C84,Chronos,"This Dual Pack contains the two Mega Man games for the PSP. ""Powered Up"" is a remake of the original NES ""Mega Man"", while ""Maverick Hunter X"" is a remake of the SNES ""Mega Man X"".

The art of Mega Man Powered Up is in a highly exaggerated childish cartoon style (""chibi"" or ""super deformed"" to use the Japanese terms for the style) which can take some getting used to, and may not appeal to long-time fans of the series. However, this does not mean that the gameplay is in any way watered down.

Powered Up contains a number of modes, including ""Old Style"", ""New Style"", and ""Construction Mode"". Old Style is a relatively faithful remake of the original game, with only the graphics and a few minor details altered. New Style has new music, new level designs, and two new Robot Masters. New Style also allows you to play as a number of different characters including the Robot Masters. Construction Mode allows you to design your own levels using elements from the game.

Between the various modes, multiple difficulty levels, and over a dozen playable characters (each with a unique game play style) Mega Man Powered Up has an incredible amount of replay value.

Moving on to Maverick Hunter X, its graphics are in a pseudo-3D style, but the character designs are fairly similar to that of the original game. A few items are in new places, and the Sigma stages have been redesigned, but for the most part the game plays pretty similarly to the original Mega Man X. In addition to the main ""X"" mode, there is a new ""Vile"" mode, in which you get to play as one of X's primary adversaries. There is also a short animated movie telling of the events that take place just prior to the game, though unfortunately it is not entirely consistent with some of the other Mega Man X  games.

While neither game can replace the games they were based on, I feel they both make excellent supplements to them.

In conclusion, if you own a PSP and wish to check out the Mega Man series these games are a good place to start, and if you are a die-hard Mega Man who owns a PSP you ought to try these games out. (However, if you don't own a PSP I wouldn't suggest getting one solely to play these games.)",Two great remakes,1438214400,,,

God of War 3 was coming right around the corner, and this collection was the perfect way to get me ready to go for the upcoming PS3 release.

The gameplay of the God of War series is always brutally efficient.  You control Kratos, the God of War, on a quest that fluctuates from rage to redemption and revenge.  The entire experience is engineered to allow fast and brutal combat sequences, to allow the player to express his rage against countless hordes of twisted monsters.  Right from the get-go you'll feel like a total war machine, stringing together combos and taking enemies out left and right.  There's a learning curve here for some of the tougher bad guys in the game, but Kratos has plenty of weapons and techniques at his disposal to overcome these challenges.

One of the highlights of the God of War series is always the boss battles.  Huge, epic, and brutal - Kratos will have to pull out every trick in the book to take down these monsters.  Most boss battles end with a sequence of button presses that you need to execute as they pop up on the screen, while Kratos performs a crazy finishing blow on the boss.  These sequences are always completely over the top, and puts a satisfying end onto every boss battle.

In summary, you're getting a ton of content here for a budget price.  If you haven't played either of these games yet, and they appeal to you at all, then pick them up ASAP.  Please note that these games are NOT for the weak of heart or for kids.  The action is over the top and very brutal, with tons of blood and gore.

5.0,False,"12 27, 2000",A3CYIPLD9090ZK,B000053VWB,David Baker,"It's been awhile in the making, and it could have been better, but Capcom vs. SNK is still my favorite fighter. 33 fighters in all (Capcom has the extra, of course), and yes, all the dream matches--Ryu and Ken vs. Kyo and Iori, Chun-Li and Guile vs. Mai and Terry Bogard, etc.--are just as fun as you'd think. Being the jaded gamer I am though, I'll whine about the flaws of the game first. My biggest complaint is about the absence of some characters. With the exception of Morrigan, the entire Capcom side is represented by Street Fighter characters. That's not bad, but, did Capcom REALLY think gamers would rather play as Dhalsim, E. Honda, Zangief, and Cammy over Mega Man, Strider, Arthur, and Tron? It's kinda hard to believe so. And as far as SNK goes, well... where's Andy Bogard, Krauser, Haohmaru, and Robert Garcia? These are main characters here people, and Capcom vs. SNK just doesn't have them. To top it off, EVERY SNK character was stripped of moves. What's up with that? Is Capcom jealous or something? Another major complaint is with the Street Fighters themselves. With the exception of Ryu, Ken, and M. Bison, all the Street Fighters look EXACTLY like they did in Street Fighter Alpha 3! .... Granted, graphics don't make a game, but it still annoys as they don't quite fit. They look downright cheap when compared to the SNK characters. And while this is a minor gripe, would it have hurt Capcom to put in some real endings to the game? Now, for the good points to the game. Well, first of all, it's Capcom vs. SNK. Any hard-core gamer already knows that this is a dream come true. To have Iori give his level 3 Maiden Masher to Ryu was something I've been dreaming about for years now. But of course, the game needs more than a license as its crutch, and Capcom, being the unofficial company for gamers that they are, knows this. The graphics are absolutely amazing. All the characters (excluding the pasted-in SFA3 characters) are extremely detailed. The backgrounds are enough to make you drool (they even have stage intros [SNK trademark]). My personal favorite was Akuma's stage. There's also lots of secret stuff to get in the game (more than Marvel vs Capcom 2). It takes forever to get all these secrets, but they are worth it. The music is pretty decent, too. Not being a fan of video game music (why listen to it when I can listen to the real stuff?), I must say really enjoyed a few of the songs (the stage music for M. Bison and Geese Howard was amazing). The control is exactly what you'd expect for a fighting game--nothing special. How good the control is for most fighting games, 2D in particular, depends solely on the controller design. And as most of you know, the Dreamcast controller isn't perfect (give me the Saturn or PSX analog controller any day of the week). The controls for Capcom vs. SNK aren't exactly in Street Fighter or King of Fighters favor--they're somewhere in between. Instead of the normal, six attack buttons that the Street Fighter series has, there's only four. And the SNK characters now play with a slightly more Street Fighter feel to them. Then, there's the much talked about ratio system. Personally, I don't mind it. The player gets four points to their selection of characters. Weak characters are one point, normal characters are two points, bosses are three points, and the hidden characters are four points. All this goes out the window once you get the secrets, but you still use if you play the arcade mode. You also get to pick between which groove you want--Capcom or SNK. Capcom's groove is just like the Street Fighter Alpha one, you have a super combo bar that levels up if you give or take damage so you can unleash you super move. SNK's groove is just like King of Fighters. Your bar levels up when you take damage, or you can can just do it yourself by powering up. There's also a groove point system. You get points by how you hurt your opponent and then get ranked. And as if all that wasn't enough, you get a training mode and a color edit. Another cool little quirk to the game is what characters do before they have a fight. For example, right before Ryu and Sagat fight, Sagat touches the scar on his chest. There's lots of these in the game, and my personal favorite was when Chun-Li fights Yamazaki. In the end, Capcom vs. SNK could have been much better...but as it stands, Capcom vs. SNK is a classic that every gamer should play. PS: SNK is better. Period.","Ah, Yeah!",977875200,11,,

Otherwise, This game allows a broad spectrum of choices for the player. You can choose which route to take on a map, Stealth or no stealth, which weapon is most effective, etc. The re-playability lies heavily on the ability.

-Fun campaign with a nice learning curve. At every step, the Campaign fills you in on exactly what you need to do and where you need to go. The execution is left completely up to you, allowing for maximum freedom in accomplishing your goals.

-Excellent multiplayer, where up to 4 players can hand off one system between turns (or use their own) and compete together. Add in Fog of War (parts of the map your units can't see are blacked out) and you have an intense but light-hearted wargame.

-Deceptively deep. Advance Wars takes well under an hour to learn and appreciate. For those who care to practice, the game has such a wealth of tactical options and minute details that it could take a lifetime to master. Your level of addiction is entirely up to you, and you're rewarded at each and every step.

-Lots of unlockable COs, maps, and modes, for the collector in you.

Personally, Advance Wars and its sequel are currently my favorite turn-based games (with the sequel in the lead only because there's a little stuff to play with). GameBoy, PC, board games... nothing else can compete.

If you own Advance Wars, this game only adds one measly unit- the Neotank (the biggest tank in the game). So what's there to enjoy? The continuation of the story, and the addition of a number of other elements (pipelines and factores and death rays that the Black Hole Army wants to use against you) along with CO Super Powers that are generally stronger the ""first level"" powers that are basically the same as they were in the first game, at the price of a little extra wait... if you liked Advance Wars one, two is the same game with some extras.","Advance Wars, only better",1102118400,3,,

A lot of the other games are fun as well, and as indicated, a few allow for more than two players.

The one bad thing is the controllers, which are a hinderance with a few of the games.

It does the job, but it takes way too long to recharge the batteries and, while it gave the appearance of charging the batteries while the X360 was in standby mode, that didn't seem to speed the process up all that much.  So, I was hyped when I saw that the Quick Charge kit was coming out and I'm glad I picked one up.

Not only can the Quick Charge kit charge up more than one battery at a time, it charges the batteries (at least ) 10 x's faster than the Play and Charge kit.  I've had this kit for two weeks now and I can confirm that it does charge up a spent X360 controller battery in about 2 hours and two in about four.  Most of mine have charged fast than those times, but I've never let one of the batteries totally die before switching it out (the ring of light flashing that the current battery is dying drives me nuts).  The Quick Charge kit comes with one rechargeable battery, so be sure to pick up an extra if you don't already have one.  With at least one extra charged battery @ all times, you should be set.

There's not really much else to say about this kit.  It works and it works well.  I would definitely recommend this kit over the Play and Charge kit b/c A) the Quick Charge kit is SO much faster, B) you won't have a recharging controller plugged into the front of your X360 as you would with the Play and Charge kit, and C) I've had some tech issues with the Play and Charge kit. (Sometimes it says the battery is charged, but when I use the battery and check its strength, the X360 dashboard says the battery is only 1/2 charged.  Sure enough, in just a few hours, the ring of light will start to flash again, indicating that the supposedly charged battery is not so charged now.  It doesn't happen every time, but often enough to be annoying.  The Play and Charge kit also seems to take different lengths of time to charge the batteries.  And sometimes, if I leave the controller plugged in, the recharge light will turn back to red after having been green for anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.  Not so good.)

It is true that the graphics weren't the best, the voice acting made you cringe at times, and the camera angle flounders a bit on some stages, but despite these flaws it still proved an amazing game with a mature plot for its time for many Sonic fans I included. It also of course introduced a wildly popular character known as Shadow the Hedgehog.

Many people believe either that the original died at the end of SA2 Battle or that he still lives. It's still an ongoing debate, but I hope to explain how that ties into my opinions of this game being the last of classic Sonic games.

I've played Sonic Heroes and was surprised, but also confused at Shadow's reappearance. His noble sacrifice would've been worthless. Had it not been for Rouge's line "".....do you know that Shadow is a robot.......?"" and Omega's response, ""The original must exist somewhere."" I would've believed that Shadow had a bright future with the Sonic gang. This has also led many fans to believe that the original Shadow was still alive somehow. Whether or not you believe the current Shadow is the original or the android clone, I believe it's safe to say that SA2 Battle's version of Shadow is the best portrayal of him. The newer games have me stolidly believing that the current Shadow is indeed an android clone. What had happened to that beautiful character development we saw in SA2 Battle towards the end? He abandons his past entirely? He loses his memories? He develops a hatred (or at least dislike) towards Sonic and friends? He's an alien spawn? What? The sheer randomness of plot and inconclusive multiple endings of the game Shadow the Hedgehog makes me further believe that particular game was made purely for fan service and NOT for the canon series. (That's why I personally go with the facts in Sonic Heroes as the last relevant canon.)

Which brings me to another point. For Sonic fans who know of the classics (games, cartoons, and comics), the newer reincarnations fall severely short. The newer games' plots and character personalities are pretty much butchered. Take Knuckles for example. He didn't use to be this hot-headed, gullible idiot. He used to be rather cool and mature. The Sonic franchise is basically a cash cow ruining the authenticity of the series. I've seen several fan-made Sonic creations which rival what the franchise used to be.

I said all that to say this: After SA2 Battle, the games seem to go downhill fast. This game is likely the last classic game in the franchise.",The Last Classic Sonic Game,1406851200,,,

You have side kick faeries that help you fight your enemies with their powers and you can create your own characters too. You can play as a Rogue, Warrior or Mage. Each has it's own strengths and skills. There are tons of items, weapons and armors to find or buy from the merchant too. The weapons and Armour change the look and abilities of your character. Online multi-player is the best part. You can have up to four players and believe me, sometimes you need all four to make it through the bosses.

Once my copy arrived in the mail and I started playing it, I found it to be very fun.  It is similar to the Monkeyball games in that you tilt the level to move, but in this game you control a blob of mercury rather than a ball.  I find that this mercury blob is a bit easier to control than the ball in Super Monkeyball: Banana Blitz.

I think that this game is a very innovative new twist on the classic Marble Madness/Super Monkeyball style gameplay.  I'm just surprised by how good this game is and how much content it has given the price!

As you progress through the game, the levels get trickier, but so far I find that they are all more than possible to complete.  It just takes some practice, but if you stick with it, you will beat the level.  The game will make you think sometimes, because the solution to a level is not always immediately obvious, but I think that's a good thing.

Zeus follows in its predecessors footsteps, making it relatively simple to pick up on the basic idea. You plant your crops, build your industries, set up trade and shops and tax collectors. Add in some basic services - home maintenance, water, infirmaries.
They've got, of course, Greek-themed things to build. The theater is a big draw, as are the gymnasiums and schools of philosophy. It's religion, though, where this game differs from the others. Instead of trying to balance your way through keeping all the gods happy, in most missions you are working towards bringing in a hero, or pleasing a certain god. And these gods are very personal!
The first mission, for example, involves a hydra. You don't build up warriors to kill it - you biuld a temple to the hero Hercules, and once you make the town alluring enough, he appears and roams around, spouting heroisms. He goes and kills the Hydra for you, and all is well.
The game has a series of tutorials for those who haven't played this type of sim before, but for those experienced in the others, diving into the first ""beginner"" mission isn't a walk in the park. Unlike some other games where the first missions boringly walk you through the same old crop maintenance, this starts you full bore into the game, with a very wide selection of buildings you can use and things to do. It gets more challenging from there.
There are also various open play options, if you just want to create your own military adventure or build a city that stretches from coast to coast.

The graphics are slick and wondrously cool looking, the fighters have all sorts of cool moves and bad-@$$ weapons, every bit of storyline is etched with gigantic excellency, and the sound and music are cool to the core! I love this game and it is so far the best game I have ever played in all terms of beat 'em up games. Here's how I rate the 12 fighters:

1. Scorpion-My favorite Mortal Kombat fighter of all time. Cool moves, cool costume, cool storyline, cool everything. He is # 1!

2. Sub-Zero-The second best loved by me. His freezing powers and ice sword are to be reckoned with, and so are his battle skills!

3. Kitana-My favorite female. She is a hot babe and has lots of moves that make her an @$$ kicker. Nice steel fans, too!

4. Sonya-One of my favorites. She's nearly as hot as Kitana, and also is very fast and ferocious. Her kiss of death rocks, also!

5. Frost-A cool(both ways)character. She has all of Sub-Zero's powers and more speed, plus good looks and two ice daggers. Yow!

6. Shang Tsung-Even better a villain here than in the MK movie. He has a cool getup and even cooler ways of duking it all out!

7. Kano-Another great villain and the best mechanical fighter ever. His laser eye, huge strength, and butterfly knives rule!

8. Quan Chi-The final boss in this game, and what a boss he is. He's powerful, shoots gas skulls, and wields two nasty swords.

9. Jax-The second best mechanical fighter. He is big and strong, and also very fast for one his size. His gun really rocks, too!

10. Kung Lao-He's one of the coolest there is. He can throw his hat at high speed, and has all sorts of moves and a huge sword!

11. Li Mei-She is both beautiful and skilled, and carries a pair of sais along with her. You'll like her combos-very damaging!

12. Kenshi-Don't get me wrong, I think this guy is pretty good. But since there's no one I like less in the game, he's lowest.

This is a fabulous game, and I've waited for years to have it! I now finally do, and I am proud of it. Oh, and about the rating up  there? There are fighters I like more and/or less than some(not the first two, though)but it's only those 12.

In 1990 this was THE game to get! It had the biggest selling release of all time until 1999 when the more than disappointing FFVIII came around.
I'm not reviewing the NES one but rather the SNES one since that's the one we're going to get obviously! This is the best Mario game ever made! The only one that could possibly be better than this is probably Super Mario RPG on the SNES.
I'll admit I was disappointed when Nintendo re-released Super Mario Brothers 2 and then they SKIPPED THE BEST MARIO GAME and came out with a re-release of Super Mario World and then Super Mario World 2.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I heard thatt they skipped this one!
The reason why this is the greatest Mario game is because this focuses on EXACTLY what a game should focus on (Back 13 years ago especially) and that is gameplay! These days gameplay is what games tend to lack. They get tediously long (making you never want to go through it all again) and are much too focused on storyline that they forget what keeps people coming back to the game and that's gameplay.
Graphically this was by far the best looking NES game in those days and on the SNES it was just so much better looking.  However, I can't say the same for the music. I LOVED the music on the NES version but in the SNES version the music got worse. Sadly because of the GBA it WILL be worse on the GBA (Super Mario Brothers 2 had worse music as well in it's re-releases).
The controls scheme of course is top notch and easy to do as it is in most Mario games. If you're like me you were without a doubt a little displeased with Super Mario Sunshine.  But this game will make up for that.
However, I still don't like that once again we're getting a RE-release of a classic game for the GBA. When are we going to get a NEW Mario game on the gameboy advance? We've been waiting FOREVER!

I never really considered myself a huge fan of video games but with games like this one it is hard not to be. The plot is very simple and so is the story. You are on a space ship to repair it, there are aliens there and you have to fight your way out. Sound boring? Well, it's not. Has this plot been done before? Yes, think back to every Sci Fi movie of the nineties but so what!

This game really immerses you into the story and more importantly a foreboding atmosphere. The level design is very impressive the space ship that you are on is massive with winding corridors, elevators, chambers and yes it's even so big it has a mono rail. In a lot of survival horror games the appeal lies in an escapable situation in which you find your self very confined in the levels however, with this game you have many opportunities to view the ship from many angles. The game allows you to see outside the ship where you can see meteor showers and planets and you also get to experience anti gravity all while fighting off enemies which makes for some very intense battles.

With that being said there is no shortage of enemies or the ways that they can and will attack you. The great part about this game and fighting your way through it is you really never know when or where the enemies will come from. In most games you can tell by the music or when you turn a corner you are sure there is going to be something there but in Dead Space you are always guessing. The aliens jump through glass, come out of walls, hang from ceilings, float by you and on and on. With so many different ways to be attacked the designers came up with some great weapons all of which are multi functional and have two ways of shooting so attacking and being attacked never gets old. Unlike most games when engaging the enemies you always go for the head shot but in Dead Space you have to shoot off their limbs which at times can be difficult but makes for very interesting gaming.

At certain junctures of the game you are able to customize anything you want. You can buy and sell items such as air and health and you can also customize your weapons, space suit and everything in between. Aside from the weapons your space suit also allows for you control stasis and kenosis The map functions on this game are also second to none. All of your maps are 3D and very helpful for navigating your way through the ship they also don't give away the position of enemies which really adds to the games whole point which is the element of surprise.

Without giving too much away, the story takes place in a wasteland known as the Junkyard, which is a sort of purgatory.

The war ceases to be endless in the opening scene, where the rules of the game are suddenly changed by a little ""divine intervention"" if you will...

Battles are a unique twist on traditional RPG battle systems.  You have your basic attack, as well as spells and special attacks (which drain HP instead of MP).  You learn spells and passive abilities on a grid which slightly resembles that of Final Fantasy X.  What makes the battle system most unique, however, is the ""press turn"" system, which is a clever system that basically allows you to steal turns from your enemies by exploiting their weaknesses.

I am a long time PC gamer and I gotta tell ya, this adapter is frigin awesome!
Key with this: always check XIM's website for updated firmware. Out of the box it would not work with my Xbox One controller..within a week there was a firmware update and it works flawlessly. Now, I can play all my consoles like they are a PC game: using mouse and keyboard.
It will ""flash"" your game configs in, well, a flash. You can either use an android device or android phone...it does support using an Iphone or Ipad but because Apple is a little more strict with their blue tooth technology you do have to jump through a small hoop to download the app for Apple, because the app is ""in development""...but it can be done. I believe you just give XIM the email address associated with your Apple product and they forward it to Apple.
I purchased this and started using it for Xbox One's Star Wars Battlefront. You download the latest firmware, make sure you follow the instructions to set this up (on XIM's website and in the box) and within minutes you'll be playing your Xbox like a PC game: WITH MOUSE AND KEYBOARD.
Note: this device is not for wireless keyboard and mice, only wired. Very important to note that.
To give an idea how well it works: I've never played console games....and certainly not first person shooters with a game controller.
My first multiplayer map my score was like 3 kills to 18 deaths.....lol. Sad right, but then I got my adapter.
It may not sound like much but after plugging in my device and playing one map my score was: 7 kills to 3 deaths! Again, doesn't sound like much but here's where you see the difference: I went from a negative score (more deaths than kills) to a 2 to 1 ratio POSITIVE SCORE ( more kills than deaths!)
Now you see the difference! It's not something to hack the game with, if that's your intent then you are wasting your money. All this does is make it possible for gamers that use a mouse and keyboard to be able to continue to use a mouse and keyboard....on a console.
It works, it's easy to configure, and you'll get instant results!","BEST KEYBOARD MOUSE ADAPTER FOR XBOX ONE, WORKS IN MINUTES!!!",1452988800,,,

Whilst one review didn't like the cotton mat, it is quite good quality and better than using another mterial such as paper (as some of these card games do). The graphics are very impressive and the animations are smooth. You can turn the animations of if you so wish.

You don't even need a controller for this game (expect for the menus) and the main game can be played with just cards - which is really cool and convient. The 'action cards' need to be held up to the eye which is a knack as you must get it the right distance from the eye and whithout obsuring the face of the card.

I personally don't mind the metal soundtrack it seems to suit the game (but when defeat is near - I hate it!). When the game starts to get a bit crowded (with lots of cards on the mat) there is often a problem with one card not being read properly - you fix that and in doing so, you ruin another card etc. Shadows are the main cause of this (so buy/get a desktop lamp or something!).

The game allows you focus on the great stratgry element - but the tutrials are more cofusing than they are helpful. Play with a friend the first few times and learn from each others mistakes - before challanging a computer or going online. The cards themselves are good quality and with currently over 110 crds to collect (with more on there way) the game always give you soemthing new.

I'd suggest to anyone to buy it. It is a very long game. I don't care how quick you do the puzzles.  The comparison to God of War was very obvious, but this game really does come into its own and plays well.  Some of the things they thought of to play the bosses and play are very unique especially when it comes to portals and interacting with your environment.  While you think you have caught onto the games way of doing things, the game constantly changes its tactics and introduces new levels and environments and ways to interact and use your tools.  I have to admit that some of the puzzles are damn near impossible.

Since I was used to the original ""SimCity"", I thought the zoning feature was very weird.  It took a while for me to realize that you need to put powerlines THROUGH the zone.  Well, after I mastered that, I then found out there is a water system.  Oh boy!  That took about an hour to master that, then I went on to master the bevy of other add-on's.  My suggestion is this: when you first get this game, make a city that's just for experiments.  Put the year in 2050, and build everything you can.  That way you get the idea of what each thing is.  Anyways, for those people that want to know how good the game is:  graphics are great!  They probably aren't as good as ""SimCity 3000"", but my computer can't handle that (stupid Pentium 1).  After you make a huge metropolis, though, there starts to be HUGE buildings, and you can't see through those unless you set the veiwing to a different setting.  Learning curve is about like a small cliff; you start off learning and experimenting.  The game is difficult at the beginning.  However, after you get past the beginning, it's pretty moderate after that.  Plane crashes are very annoying.  If you have a tall building by your airport, the plane will ram right into it.  That's when the option of ""no desasters"" comes in handy.  Sound is really cool because you get to hear your city working!  Well, this is a great game!

This game is steeped in the purest variety of Gothic Horror, and is so thick with atmosphere that it was difficult to navigate my way back to real life when it came time to put the controller down.

Welcome to Yharnum.quite possibly the most threatening virtual world Ive encountered.  Theres something so pleasing about the way From Software can so effectively intimidate their audience: the fear I felt while playing was so satisfyingly raw, humbling, and exhilarating.  Its a unique feeling in games these days (sadly), yet something that From Software has been bold and skilled enough to capitalize in since Demons Souls in 2009.

And on that note: is this game too hard?  Some have complained about the difficulty, but I think it just depends on the way you play games.  The thing with Bloodborne, (and the other Souls games), is that they are only frustratingly difficult in the first couple hours.  I promise you that.  These games aren't totally accessible at first, and they really test your mettle from the get-go.  But I guarantee that, once youve leveled up a bit, and beaten the first boss or so, Bloodborne reveals a much livelier pace, one that makes the challenges feel less daunting; you will also not feel as frustrated.  Maybe challenged, terrified, and pushed to the limit, but not quite angryand this is credited to the games fairness.  Despite whatever challenge you might face, Bloodborne never quite feels sadistic, or like its just screwing around with you.  If you die, its because you made a mistake, albeit one you will attempt to avoid ever making again.

With that said, I strongly urge you to power through those first couple hours of Bloodborne, hang in there, because my God, the rest of the experience is so profoundly satisfying.  The excitement of stumbling upon a new, massive, and gorgeous location is practically ineffable.  The environments are so freakishly detailed that they can even be distracting at times: sometimes I just want to wander around and look at all the statues, doors, interiors etc.

Bloodborne inspires an authentic sense of awe, the kind that fills you with wonder and fear.

When you begin the game, you wake up in your apartment and figure out that you were locked in and the clues that the ? has left in your apartment leads you to different worlds that test you skills.

You may find yourself asking questions like ""Why did I bother playing Age of Empires II, or Rise Of Heroes, or Empire Earth III?""  Don't beat yourself up...it's okay.

Okay, so I usually don't go into graphics when I review games, but I feel I have to make special note here.  The pure scale of how far you can zoom in and out amazed me.  You can zoom all the way out to full galaxy view or all the way in to the cockpit of a starfighter.  Simply Amazing!  Also, you can rotate your view to any angle, so you can view your ships from behind, above, under, in front, from the side....wherever.  Simply Amazing!

The ""fun factor"" of this game is definitly a 10.  If you love building a massive empire over a couple of days to later unleash the fury of your rail gun on your enemy, then you'll love this game.

The learning curve is a little steep, but nothing that a few hours of play can't cure.  I will put a caveat here that there is a cheat method for this game....not that I'm advocating cheating....but it is a bit indepth, and really not worth it.  Just learn to play the game well.

There are a couple of items that you need to be aware of when you buy this game.  First, be prepared to play for awhile.  This is not Age of Empires, where you can finish a game in like 3 hours.  Secondly, there are 3 games included with this package, but they all install at the same time.  If you save a game using the old game (not entrenchment), your save file will be corrupt.  This has to do with a patch that the expansion packs add in, and it will mess up your original saves.  How do you fix it?  Just play the game using Entrenchment....

First of all the track listing is MUCH better than in the other music games, which typically rely heavily on old music I frankly hate. I am not a kid but seriously I have no interest at all in playing classic rock on a guitar. Not now, or ever. I love the genre of music in this game, heavy house/techno/dance mashups/remixes. Really, Mo' Money Mo' Problems, how can you go wrong? And a track by Prodigy (another downloadable), with the toughest in the game being Chemical Brothers' Galvanize. Plus several pop songs that hit the charts this year (2010).

Music aside, the game itself is pretty cool. The music is actually customizable on the fly; instead of simply hitting notes and having maybe a whammy bar that very occasionally changes the sound you can motivate it here with fading, among other things.

This is a GREAT comic book character, turned  into a movie, and then a tie-in-game to boot. It is the best one out of any of the console releases. This particular version of THOR was made by a different developer and it is such a shame PS3 and XBOX 360 didn't use this developers. I am not going to go too much into the game details because it has already been said in previous reviews, but essentially this game is a hack and slash action/adventure game. It is very similar to God of War, Ghostrider, and Resident Evil. The player controls THOR, battles an onslaught of enemies, progresses, and then has a boss battle. It is nothing groundbreaking, but it works well here. It didn't work as well on the PS3/XBOX 360 versions.  The player also gets to do some cool moves with the Wii controller that didn't bother me and controls are smooth and precise. It can get a bit repetitive at times because there is no variety with the minions that Thor fights. They are all the same character design, but that is to be expected.  This game throws in a mixture of everything and makes it work.  I wish the 3DS visuals were a bit more stunning because I've seen gorgeous games like in Mario 3DS and Zelda Orcarina of Time, so the 3DS is capable of it. The visuals are fine for me because game play matters more, but it is very PS2-esque and the cinematic scenes are just comic book images with spoken dialogue. Overall, this is a must have title and the price makes it all the more reason to get it. The Wii and Nintendo 3DS versions are the only ones worth getting.

Free open world styled gameplay and while the possibilities aren't endless, there's a truck load of 'em. From starting fights to saving nerds, getting girls and skipping class. Hiding in the trash, picking lockers, brawling with hobos, this game has a lot to keep you entertained. So much to do, so much to unlock, it's how good games were made before there was DLC lol. Some people believe that the game hasn't been improved that much to be dubbed a ""Scholarship Edition"", and they're right. Sure the graphics are better than the original, the gameplay is fun with the Wii controls, but with only 4 news classes, a handful of new characters and 8 new missions it isn't much of an upgrade.

If you're like me however, and never owned/played the original, then this will definitely be the right choice to make. Females should check this out. Girls have a way of being attracted to simulation games and this game does the genre justice. Every girl I know who's played or seen me played it really likes it. My girlfriend LOVES this game. I'm not a fan of Rockstar or GTA so I'm surprised I picked up one of their games. This isn't ""just"" a kid version to GTA like some people say. The game actually has a good solid story behind it and being good is encouraged, by the game rewarding you for passing classes etc, but you have the choice to be good, bad, or both, and no matter what path you choose the game is fun.

Parents should be cautious when buying this game, If you're the type to care what your child sits in front of a tv feeding his mind that is. This game is rated teen, but it's one of those teen games that couldn't been easily made a mature rated game but didn't, just so they could widen their marketing range. There's harsh language being tossed around almost all the time no matter where you go. No F-bombs, but a mountain heap of everything else, and tons of violence and stealing. Just informing you guys cuz I know not everyone's ok with that kinda stuff. This is a teen game but I wouldn't recommend it for a 13 yr old if I were like that. Maybe a 16-17 yr old. All in all the Wii has the best version of Bully as it's improved over the original PS2 version, and WAY cheaper than the exact same version over on the 360, who's graphics for this game, by the way, are BARELY better than the Wii version.

There are some cons though. Slow downs happen sometimes. This is probably due to the port so nothing's wrong with the game. It won't freeze or anything, just drops in frames a bit at times near certain areas. Not bad enough to affect gameplay at all, but would have been better if it ran in steady 30FPS. This really IS a PS2 game, and you can tell by the ridiculously long load times. That's one thing I never liked about the PS2, and the Wii version doesn't load any faster. Besides those two things though it's a great game and I'd recommend it to any Wii owner for sure.","Never Played The Original?

There's a reason why this game has been re-released for some times (Not as much as Rayman 2, but still). That reason is...everything.

The game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to in a video game. I can tell there were LOTS of effort put into this masterpiece. You can even put the game into a CD player and it would play the music!

Before there was Ly, Lums, Razorbeard, the Rabbids, or even Globox for that matter, there was Rayman, the fairy that created him, and the evil Mr. Dark. This was a platformer that just suddenly improved upon everything people loved about platforming games. It had great gameplay, catchy music (as noted), and amazing graphics that reveal hugely detailed environments.

As you start the game, you only start out with the basics: Running and jumping. But that as you progress through, you get newer powers, such as being able to hang on platforms, THROW your FISTS at enemies (Man, that's cool), and >GASP< being able to fly for a short period of time! Sure, later games have these powers as staples to Rayman's character, but back when this was the only game out, you have to work your way to get these....and you would have fun doing it.

The problem is that younger gamers may be put off by the game's difficulty. Yeah, it is challenging, but some find it to actually be TOO challenging. Nevertheless, this is a gem that you should buy in case you have a Playstation lying around.",Spectacular,1306022400,,,

5.0,False,"07 15, 2011",A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B002BS4834,Feelah the tigress,"I bought this game about a year ago, and I haven't gotten around to playing it until now (I got distracted by other games and such).  I was both excited and a little wary when I first heard about this game.  I love Miles Edgeworth; he's my absolute favorite character from the Ace Attorney series, so I was naturally thrilled when I heard he'd be getting his own game.  However, I was also worried that the developers might inadvertently (or purposely) ruin his personality.  I've had some bad experiences with game sequels where the developers completely ruin the originally established personality of the main character (read my Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney review if you'd like to know all about that - what they did to Phoenix's character is inexcusable).  Then, I heard that there'd be no actual courtroom gameplay.  I was disappointed by this news, but I remained cautiously optimistic.  So, how does this game hold up?  Let's find out!

Graphics (score 8/10): This is the first entry in the Ace Attorney series to feature 3-D graphics.  All previous entries were in first-person, and only featured 2-D character portraits during scenes.  Since this is now technically a game with 3-D graphics, I need to judge it against other DS games with 3-D graphics.  As such, it isn't the best I've ever seen.  The little character sprites are kind of pixelated, unclear and undefined, especially compared to the character sprites in games like ""Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days"" or ""The World Ends With You"".  I was originally going to give this section a score of ""7"" for ""average"" but the background graphics elevate it a bit.  They are very crisp and clear and nicely detailed.  In addition, this game still has the 2-D character portraits which appear during main dialogue scenes, and they still look fantastic.

Music (score 8/10): The music is pretty good.  There are some catchy songs here and there.  The only thing that bugs me is the fact that the older entries in the series seemed to have more dynamic music changes (i.e. music would change during dialogue scenes as character's moods changed).  This game doesn't seem to do that nearly as much.  Basically, a main character's theme music will start playing when they walk in, and then it just stays until they leave.  Or, the ""excited"" music will play while you're grilling a witness, but it never changes.  In older games, the music would often change when a witness would get especially nervous or sad.  In general, it's not bad music at all, but it's not quite as awesome as the older Ace Attorney entries.  As for voice acting, there's still no voice acting outside of a few yells of ""objection"" or ""hold it"".  I'm personally glad, because this is a text heavy game, and some of these character seem like they'd be really annoying to listen to.

Characters (score 10/10):  First off, I'm very pleased to say that Miles Edgeworth's personality remains appropriately snarky and sarcastic, yet classy and refined.  There are also a number of small (and some large) cameos of older characters for long-time fans of the series (if you're a fan of Franziska, you'll be especially pleased).  The only problem with all these cameos is that it gets a bit tedious after awhile (even Missile show up!), and it also immediately let's you know that these characters are off the suspect list.  It still didn't bother me TOO much, but I can see how this might bug someone else.  The new characters that are introduced are interesting and enjoyable though.  All that aside, I must say that if you are a big fan of Edgeworth (like me!), this game is an absolute joy.  It's just so satisfying getting to play as Edgeworth the whole time.  They did a very good job conveying his sarcastic personality, which contrasts nicely with Phoenix's nave goodness (which you got to know from previous games).  You even get to spend a good amount of time with Detective Gumshoe as Miles' assistant.  They have a really cool Sherlock Holmes/Watson dynamic which is quite fun.  Overall, both returning characters and new characters are well-handled and enjoyable.

Story (score 9/10): The story is just as good as you'd expect from an entry in the Ace Attorney series.  There are plenty of twists and turns that'll keep you guessing until the end.  Miles spends most of his time getting falsely accused of murder or otherwise trying to solve a murder mystery.
I'm still annoyed that Miles doesn't get to do any courtroom action.  I mean, he's a famous PROSECUTOR, not a detective.  Don't get me wrong, he's makes a great detective, but that's not really his job.  Phoenix Wright had to do a lot of his own detective work, but he also did his job as a defense attorney.  Why doesn't Miles get to do his own work as a prosecutor?  You basically solve the entire case and bust the bad guy anyways - just like Miles would've done in court.  The gameplay where you wear the suspects down with evidence is exactly the same as the gameplay from court cases in previous entries in the series so there's no reason there couldn't have been court segments included!  You know, I have a theory on why the developers avoided it.  I daresay it's because the whole rest of the series builds up defense attorneys as the heroes and protagonists of the game, and the prosecutors (with the arguable exception of Edgeworth himself) as the scummy villains.  I guess they just wanted to avoid having Edgeworth go up against a defense attorney and having to paint defense attorneys in a bad light.  I personally think this would actually be a good thing.  I would've loved to face Phoenix in court and actually prove that he's not always right!  I think if they'd done that with this game, it would've lent even more depth to all the characters involved.  I'm not saying that they have to make Phoenix look bad to make Miles look good (seriously, Phoenix couldn't look any worse than he does in Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney anyway), but they could've at least taken this opportunity to show us that Phoenix, even though he is well-intentioned, is not infallible.  That would've been really cool and it would've painted a more complex portrait of both Miles and Phoenix.  Other than that, I'm pretty happy with the story.  I certainly found it entertaining regardless.  The story does seem a bit less humorous than the older entries, and I think this is totally due to Miles being the main character versus Phoenix.  He's just a lot more serious and less comical in personality.  Don't get me wrong, there's still plenty of humor, it just feels a bit more toned down and a bit more sarcastic in style versus just being silly.  The story feels more like a thriller/mystery with a dash of humor than a full-blown comedy.  It's still greatly entertaining, so no worries there.

Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  The first and biggest difference in gameplay is definitely the switch from pure ""point and click gameplay"" where you just tapped on the screen to examine things to a third person perspective.  I mentioned the new 3-D graphics a bit in the ""Graphics"" section, and the reason they exist is because of this change in perspective.  Instead of just tapping on the screen, now you are directly controlling a little Edgeworth sprite.  You walk him around the screen and examine things by making him face them and hitting the ""A"" button.  I actually think I prefer this change because it seems to make the game feel more lively and interactive than past iterations.  I don't know why, but seeing sprites of all the characters walking across the areas and doing things just makes these characters seem more alive to me and less like cardboard cutouts.  I actually hope they keep this format for future games in this series.  As for the rest of the gameplay, it should seem pretty familiar to fans of the previous games, except, of course, that there are no courtroom segments.  Even though I miss the courtroom battles, the actual gameplay elements involved did make it into this game, albeit in a slightly different format.  You still ""cross-examine"" people and point out contradictions, it's just not in a courtroom.  You basically do this whenever you need to get information out of a witness at the crime scene or when you're arguing with someone.  The other new gameplay additions are ""Deduction"" and ""Logic"".  The ""Deduction"" option pops up occasionally when you are examining an area.  Basically, it involves moving a cursor to a specific spot and then choosing a piece of evidence that is related somehow.  Edgeworth will then make some sort of useful observation.  The ""Logic"" system is now one of my favorites.  When I first heard about it, I thought it would be tedious and irritating, but it's actually quite fun.  Occasionally, when you are examining a crime scene or other location, Edgeworth will make an observation or raise a question, and it will be added to the ""Logic"" menu.  At any point, you can hit the Logic button in the corner of the screen and it will bring up the collection of Edgeworth's various thoughts.  Then, you pick out the two that are logically related, and he will connect the two to make a new observation.  It's quite cool.  I also must mention that this game has a very good difficulty balance.  Some of the older entries in the series felt way too irritatingly hard (like Ace Attorney: Justice for All).  Ace Attorney Investigations feels challenging enough to be satisfying, but not so impossible as to be frustrating - it's a good balance.  The pacing is also excellent - the game manages to mix up the ""cross-examinations"" and detective work portions in just such a way that you don't end up feeling like you're spending too much time doing one or the other.  All in all, it just feels like a nicely balanced game.

Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  You know what?  I think this game might be my favorite game in the Ace Attorney series, with the possible exception of the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (can't quite decide, but those two are definitely my favorites).  ""Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"" is definitely the most enjoyable game in the series I've played (and I've played all the ones before this).  It's just extremely fun to play, probably entirely due to the new gameplay additions, the challenging but still reasonable difficulty curve, the great story, the excellent pacing, and the presence of Miles Edgeworth himself.  This is just all around, a great game.  So, if you are a fan of the series, definitely pick this up.  If you've never played an Ace Attorney game in your life, still pick this up.  It would make a good starting point for new players, and even as a stand-alone game, it would still be fun to play.

I hate the Playstation so I have never played any of the earlier Oddworld titles.  Taking a chance, I got this for Christmas based on early XBOX game reviews and I have not regretted it yet!  While on the surface Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee looks like any other PS2 game out there, don't let that stop you from buying and enjoying this game.  What's it like?  Picture a game like Super Mario 64 or Sonic Adventure but with a much deeper plot, brain-busting puzzles and tons of technique and variety.
Yes, this game will require a great deal of thought and planning to complete.  Don't wimp out and buy the [price] strategy guide just yet (wait until you beat the game on your own and then replay it with the strategy book to get to all the items/areas you may have missed!) part of this game's appeal is figuring out the puzzles yourself.  There's a great deal of satisfaction that comes with overcoming a particularly tricky area of the game!
Your job as Abe and Munch is basically to rescue your friends and to pass through levels.  When I mentioned variety, there are levels where you must switch between the two heroes, possess enemies, use a crane to drop explosives on unsuspecting rivals, and resurrecting fallen comrades.  The powerups are actually useful and the story is both funny and interesting....I actually found myself laughing along with the nicely done between-level CGI movies!  Control is crisp and I found it to be really fun when you get Munch in his wheelchair!  Good stuff indeed!  Oh, and you get to save at any point in the game-this is the way it SHOULD be!
Replayability is high because you are graded on your Qarma, in other words, the more friends you rescue, the higher your score.  This is difficult in that you must also utilize your friends to engage the enemies and some will be killed in the process.  The trick is to use your friends to fight only when absolutely necessary and only when you have sufficient numbers to do so.
All in all, I love this game!  Buy this for your Xbox, you won't be disappointed!","Not the most technically impressive XBOX game, but great FUN",1014508800,8,,

For the gamer, they rock, for the parents, not so much - your kid won't be able to hear you unless you get right up in front of them. I admit it, I love games and when you need to coordinate attacks while dealing with much distraction already, the Turtle Beach headphones really allowed me to focus. But beware, you can really get lost with these on your head!

The microphone is really crisp. I had my son use these headphones for about 2 weeks (it's now a tug of war to get them back) and on the listening end, I found his voice to be as clear as if he was standing next to me in a soundproof room. I also really loved the adjustable nature of the headphones, they were truly comfortable sitting on my head and the ear cushions were equally comfortable, even while wearing my old lady reading glasses.

I also really love how these headphones sounded when listening to music, especially classical music and much like the gaming, I found myself completely immersed in whatever I was listening to at the time. I really love that feeling of being completely in the moment with good music, it's so incredibly relaxing. Because of the sound quality and ability to block out excess noise, you can really focus on whatever you are listening to; again, great for the one using the headphones, not so great if you are trying to get that person's attention!

The one criticism I have is the length of the cord. I get that it's meant to plug into a controller and you don't want to mess with excess slack, but a bit longer length would make them so much more universally useful.","If You are the Gamer, You'll Love These Headphones...if You are a Parent You Won't!",1467417600,,{'Edition:': ' Elite Pro Headset'},

5.0,True,"08 7, 2010",A1OAN01CO11VIX,B000ZKA0J6,Chris Redford,"Before playing this game, I was wary because of some of the reviews I was reading. Based on what people were saying, I decided to read up on Blizzard/Activision's new CEO, Robert Kotick to see how this fit into his business model. I was able to confirm that the way Starcraft 2 is being released (i.e. one sequel every year) lines up with exactly his stance on business: 'focusing on franchises that ""have the potential to be exploited every year on every platform with clear sequel potential and have the potential to become $100 million franchises"" has ""worked very well for [Activision Blizzard]"".'

So that gives a pretty clear indication that this is what this sequel schedule is about: exploitation. How to make the most money off of the franchise. There is no getting around it: this is pretty clearly for monetary purposes.

Learning this left a sour taste in my mouth. I was prepared for the game to arrive and feel like it was only a third of what I got out of the first Starcraft (e.g. equivalent to the experience of just the single Terran campaign with more missions).

So I played the game. At first, it seemed like pretty much the same old Starcraft with some extra cutscenes (and most of the cutscenes were not pre-rendered but rather used the lower quality in-game 3D engine).

However, by the end of the third mission, things started to change. Suddenly the in-game cutscenes started to look *really* good. The story started to get very immersive and personal, much more so than the original Starcraft. Once you are on-board the Hyperion, you start to feel like you are really commanding and upgrading an army. The mission details and objectives start to feel more realistic and immersive. You start to learn the meaning behind the game's first cinematic.

Finally, when you are trying to evaluate upgrades for your troops, you are given a full screen capture of a combat scenario that shows how that upgrade allows your units to be successful in a situation where they previously would have been killed. That feature was incredibly valuable to me as a player because it served the function of not only making the upgrade process feel like an immersive part of the story line but also helping me improve as a player to utilize that upgrade and see why it was valuable.

In short, if I could list one strength that this version of Starcraft has in spades over its predecessor in terms of the single-player campaign it is: immersion. And I have a hard time seeing how Blizzard could have made all three campaigns *this* immersive if they had not released them as single games. After playing this campaign, I am excited to see what they do with the Zerg when they release Heart of the Swarm. This is not the same old Starcraft single-player campaign. This is an order of magnitude more involving and fun to progress through.

So, while this sequel schedule was indisputably motivated by greed, the Blizzard development team used those lemons to make some damn fine lemonade. If you were at all excited by the prospect of a new Starcraft when Blizzard announced Starcraft 2, just buy it. You won't regret it. The amount of effort the Blizzard development team put into this game makes it well worth the price.","Despite appearances, this is a full game.",1281139200,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"07 29, 2010",A28GCEHD00JFZG,B0013RATNM,Julian Kennedy,"Sequels for video games have a better reputation than say movie sequels. Many of the most innovative games ever made (Mario 64, Grand Theft Auto 3, Final Fantasy VII) were of course sequels. Indeed in this generation we have seen many sequels improve upon their original outing (Assassins Creed 2, Mass Effect 2). These games succeed by fixing many of the niggling issues, that made the first game less than perfect, while still keeping the tone of the original piece.

Even among these improved sequels Just Cause 2 stands out. The original Just Cause could neither be called beloved nor all that terribly well received. Calling the first Just Cause a flawed open world game with some fun bits would be the kindest of labels. Nobody certainly seemed to be clamoring for a second go. When Just Cause 2 was delayed from an Christmas 2008 release date to 2009 and eventually 2010 there was no gnashing of teeth. Many expected it to never be released or at the very least, to be an under the radar, by the numbers rehash.

So when Just Cause 2 was finally released it was a jaw dropping shocker. Here was the open world Michael Bay movie we all wanted (even if we didn't know it). In fact Just Cause 2 nails two factors with such perfection mere words simply cannot do it justice.

The first is the open world itself. In the somewhat crowded field of open worlds to explore the island of Panua is simply a standout. In fact it is simply the best open world ever designed. (Knocking Oblivion and Grand Theft Auto IV out of the top spots). It is huge. It has everything from snow capped mountains to rally style deserts to Tarzanesque jungle to coral reefs. What is more impressive is that it is truly three dimensional. Unlike many open worlds you can fly anywhere up to a mile high or dive anywhere a few hundred feet below the surface. The travel is seamless and the graphics are jaw dropping gorgeous.

If the open world is the star of the show the dual-grappling hook is the love interest. Words again simply fail to describe the eventual joy one gets from use of this tool. With a grappling hook one can tie enemies to trees, fling oneself through the jungle like some parachute wearing Tarzan, hijack any vehicle in the game (including 737 passenger jets), and fulfill your Spider-man fantasies than any Spider-man game can.

Alas like any Michael Bay movie the plot itself is a throwaway. You play Agency Agent Rico Rodriguez being dropped into the South-east Asian island nation of Panau. Panau has taken over by Kim Jong Il doppelganger Baby Panay, who assassinated his father, institutes a hilariously propaganda filled regime and cuts off all ties to the US in favor of eventually revealed evil foreign powers. Your mission is to oust Panay from office, as well as track down your mentor from the first game Tom Sheldon, whom the Agency fears has gone native while on the island. To achieve all this you ally yourself with the three dominant criminal gangs on the island: the Roaches, the Reapers, and the Ular Boys.

In other words you blow stuff up to unlock criminal gang missions (which honestly consist of blowing stuff up)to finally unlock Agency missions (which also consist of blowing stuff up).

Fortunately blowing stuff up (like shooting super-mutants in slow-mo while playing Fallout 3) simply never gets old. In fact the game gets more enjoyable the longer one plays it. As one becomes more comfortable with the grappling hook-parachute mechanic, learns which cars to avoid, and realizes that the developers really did think of everything. The Island of Panua becomes an increasingly enjoyable experience.

The Nitpicks

Anytime I gush uncontrollably about a game it only seems fair to point out those few niggling problems that others may have noticed.

Vehicle Control: With over a hundred vehicles in the game it is no surprise some are better than others. With cars one will find their comfort zone between the Tuk-Tuks that can't seem to make it up hills and the overpowered Titus ZJ Cabriolet sports cars that cannot seem to go two hundred yards without flipping over. Cars in general handle well as do motorcycles and boats. Helicopters in particular are a joy to control... and that is an awfully good thing to since planes are the definite fly in the vehicle ointment.

For some reason developers decided to control planes with only the left stick. How does one fly a vehicle in three-dimensional space with a two dimensional control? Very poorly it turns out. Fortunately, outside of one mission where your jet fighter has to shoot down a rocket in flight, this really doesn't come into play if you do not want it to.

The Story and Voice Acting.  I finished the main story without really finishing the game. In fact I was only 22% done when the final credits rolled. (In the games defense It did take me 33 hours to get to that point.) Needless to say many of the Easter eggs, Mile High nudie bars, Japanese WW2 soldier encampments and the island from the TV show Lost will have to wait till my next play through.

While clearly Just Cause 2 has an insane amount of content (There is an achievement for 75% completion but none for 100% ) I do wish the story had been a little more... well there. The criminal gangs you do missions for could have also been a little better drawn as they all seem to blend together (Think the gangs in Saints Row 2 as an example of gangs done right).

The voice acting is universally awful. If it is so bad its good is truly a personal judgment. (I vote for no). Who gives the worse performance in Just Cause 2 is a game one can play with ones friends. The popular choice around here is Bolo Santos' G-Man like Singaporean accent as leader of the Reapers, but I am inclined to give the prize to Tom Sheldon's massacre of a Texas drawl.)

Ironically even though you are forced to play with a fixed character throughout (A common complaint I have with Rockstar open world games) the sheer lack of story and personality actually negates my usual complaint of being unable to ""roll my own"".

Some others have complained about the lack of ammo (and general difficulty) in the beginning of the game, the loose gun-play (which once you get used to it works rather well) and the fact they want a pony.

Generally these complaints (outside of the pony one) are negated as one gets used to the controls, upgrades their weapons, and discovers the myriad ways one can use the dual-grappling hook. The game really does improve with time and I am chomping at the bit to try another go (at a higher difficulty level no less.)

This is a MUST-OWN for any Vita owner. If you liked the Scarecrow levels in Arkham Asylum then this game is for you, because it works in a very similar way except that you guide your experience much more than you could in the Scarecrow levels.

What impresses me the most about this game is the way Armature transformed the side-scroller and gave it so much depth. There are a lot of ""Wow, I can do this too??"" moments throughout the game as the gameplay gets deeper and deeper. The combat is great as you would expect from the Arkham series. Maybe not as silky smooth as the PS3 version but not far off.

The story is good so far (like I said, I'm just 6 hours in) and the motion comic cutscenes are really charming.

The only gripe I could possibly throw out is that this game was obviously made to run on both the 3DS and the Vita, which can only hurt the Vita version. You hardly ever use the right stick (because the 3DS doesn't have one) and the touchscreen implementation is sometimes not used when you would expect it like on the map (because the 3DS uses capacitive touch and pinching to zoom in and out on that would be problematic).

So outside of the Vita being a far superior system than the only other one that this game was released on, I love this game. I really think the Vita has the chops to run a game like Arkham Asylum but I'm grateful this game exists and I've had a lot of fun playing it.","Really good Batman game, great Vita game!",1382918400,32,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

After delayed waiting, i get THIS. a spiderman game i wanted to avoid...its not as bad as i thought...This game isn't as cool as separation anxiety or maximum carnage but its more spiderman related. This time around, you gotta stop kingpin who framed you saying you made a bomb that will explode in 24 hours an everyone (stupidly) believed him and are hunting for you. You have health and limited web which can be refilled by (interestingly) taking pictures of enemies or bosses, getting cash, and trading it in for web and to prove your innocence (err...i guess). you can attack, web shoot, web shield (which is useful against some bosses), or rest at your house to refill life at anytime in a level which is a gay feature because you have to start the level over and you lose time fast (i better explain the time huh?). Ok so you have a time limit through the whole game which is supposed to be 24 hours in the game but more like 2 hours in real life. you gotta beat bosses like electro, doc ock, the lizard, venom (which is the only fun boss because the rest have a pattern...yes even electro.) and more where you collect keys from them and you have to put in the right combination to stop the bomb...which is HELL stopping the bomb cuz u gotta get the 5 keys in order right an u only get 3 tries or...BOOM! game over! start from the VERY beggining! thats why this gets 4 stars. I only got past the bomb thing ONCE. Then its showdown time with the kingpin. Oh an for those who make it to him, remember to keep an eye out for mj...or its back to the start... you can web zip in the air but unfortunatly, this is one of those ""indoor"" spidey games. I recommend using the cheat code for this game (the one that requires 2 controllers) cuz even with it, this game is still tough! Well ok only the bomb part. You wanna play the best spidey game ever made so far, check out spiderman 2 for the xbox, PS2, and gamecube. And no, spiderman 2 does not get boring like people say. it only gets boring for alittle if you play it ""24 hours"" straight.
UPDATE 1.1
I know how to deactivate the bomb at the last level!!! Ok so this is what you do. you will see 2 colors flashing on the bomb. the colors are black and one of the 5 key colors. pull out that colored key from the pause menu and press the web button as soon as the bomb flashes on the color (you have to time this so you don't press when its black but its still easy). Now the bomb will flash all 5 colors and the black color. wait until the bomb only flashes black and another color and do the same as above until you use every key and deactivate the bomb! Now you can take the vents on the right and take on king pin...who is very very hard because its kinda like in the spiderman for playstation where you gotta save  mj from sinking from the water while fighting venom except now you are fighting kingpin and saving mj from falling in a tub of fire. so here is a tip when fighting kingpin... when you see mj sinking, web the top chain to prevent her from falling. But the web will soon disapear so you gotta keep doin this while handling kingpin. For if mj dies, its game over as if the bomb were to detonate (meaning you go back to the title screen). Watch out for kingpins punches for they send you flying back to the other side of the room.

If you're looking for an ultra-premium gaming headset for the PS4 I think the 800 is really hard to beat by anything else on the market today. I own many different headsets for my various consoles and PC and the 800 is hands down the best headset I've used in terms of audio quality.

--------------------
DESCRIPTION:
--------------------
Firstly, the 800 is a 7.1 surround gaming headset. This is also the first 7.1 headset that I've ever used and I'd describe myself as a skeptic when it comes to surround sound (5.1 and 7.1) headsets. When I think of 7.1 audio I think of legitimate separate speakers plus a sub running from a high-end amp and not headsets. To say that my train of thought going into the 800's was ""how good can it be"" is fair. Well, imagine my surprise that I'm completely floored by the audio from this headset! It's staggeringly good. But more on that in a bit.

The headset itself is pretty darn large; each ear-cup measure approximately 4"" by 2.5"". The headband is a combination of matte-black plastic and rubberized plastic at the crown. Highly polished, glossy plastic covers each of the ear-cups. Padding on the ear cups is more than ample and unlike some of my other Turtle Beach headsets the 800 doesn't start hurting my ears or head during extended play sessions. I'll also mention that my large noggin has no issues comfortably wearing the 800's with room for the headset to keep expanding.

The second major component of the 800 is the base unit. The base unit serves to both charge the headset when not in use and also directly connects to the PS4 via on optical cable (sometimes called TOSLink) and a USB to Mini-USB cable. Both cables are included in the box.

Controls on the 800 are all located on the ear-cups similar to the Sony Gold and Pulse Wireless Headsets. Each ""button"" is placed at the four-axis locations on each ear-cup (N,S,E,W). The buttons aren't buttons in the same sense as they are on the Sony Gold Wireless headset; TB designed sensors under each button icon and you simply press near each sensor (the plastic cover does give a little) to input your commands into the headset. Turtle Beach refers to each of these components as ""rocker plates"". A female voice announces each of your inputs directly through the 800's speakers leaving no doubt about what you just pressed.

--------------------
USE:
--------------------
Getting the 800's configured with the PS4 is very easy though I recommend following the step by step guide in the instruction manual. One of the settings TB requires is counter-intuitive and will leave you with very low audio volume if not set properly in the PS4's settings menu.

I'll say right off the bat that the single biggest annoyance I have with this headset (and the Sony Gold headset) is that you have to memorize where each button is on the headset or take the headset off to make your inputs. I also own a set of Ear Force XO Seven Pro's for my XB1 and it's great having the audio settings (via an adapter) integrate with the controller. I imagine that the annoyance factor will decrease with time as I adjust to the 800's and start to memorize where everything is.

Each earpiece is responsible for different operations on the 800 and I'll cover each in detail.

Left Earpiece:
 Volume +/-: Each function are each controlled via independent buttons on the rocker panel. Top button is volume up and down button reduces volume.
 Bluetooth: BT can be toggled for use with a smartphone or tablet with the standard BT logo'd button on the rocker panel. Note that audio in BT is only stereo.
 Power: Press the button to turn on the headset and hold it down for a few seconds to power off. Note that when the headset is powered on and the button is pressed it toggles the 800's noise cancellation feature.
 3.5mm audio jack: The left earpiece also features a standard audio jack connection for use with compatible devices.
 LED: Each different color indicates a different state the headset is operating in:
1. Red = Charging
2. Blue = Noise cancellation off
3. Pink = Noise cancellation on

Right Earpiece:
 Chat +/-: Independent buttons are again present for chat volume settings. Top button increases volume while the bottom button decreases.
 Mic mute: Pressing this button toggles between active mic and muted mic. Holding this button down cycles through different available mic presets (more on that below).
 Preset: This button cycles through TB Signature Audio presets (again, I'll cover that in detail below) and holding the button cycles between DTS Surround modes (keep reading... I said there was a lot to cover!)
 Charging pads: These little metallic plates are located along the bottom of the right earpice and interface with prongs on the 800's base and are for charging the headset.
 BT LED: Each different color indicates a different state the headset is operating in:
1. Blue = Call mode (HSP) or Headset Profile
2. Pink = Stereo mode (A2DP) or Advanced Audio Distribution Profile; used when listening to music from a compatible device

Base:
I'll mention the base because the LEDs behind the opaque Turtle Beach story each also communicate a state for the headset.

Charging:
1. Red = Headset seated (goes off when fully charged)
2. Blue = No headset in stand or headset is not properly seated

Pairing:
1. Solid light = Headset connected
2. Double blinking light = Headset not connected

Preset information: Again a lot of information. The TL,DR version is that there are many different headset presets for both the mic and surround sound mode. In my experience these do make significant changes to the audio quality coming out of the headset. So play around and find what you like best!

To keep this review from getting out of hand I'll focus on a few key areas of the presets available in this headset. I highly recommend busting out the manual and tinkering around with the sound profiles that suit you best.

Microphone presets: This is a terrific feature for people who game in varying environments. Anyone who's played online knows how annoying it is when someone in your group or lobby has a mic that pics up everything in the room of a particular player. Different mic profiles in the 800 are intended to address those types of issues.

DTS X Surround Presets: There is a lot of different presets depending on the usage including Gaming, Movies, Music and Surround off (stereo audio). Each of these groups has additional presets that dive into specific scenarios. There are presets that focus on enemy footsteps for example or more generically a shooter preset. Under movie mode there are presets for action, horror and so on. Again a lot to cover here. I've quickly found that switching between modes is cool and all but found a few favorites that I like best and tend to leave my headset there.

--------------------
THE HIGHS:
--------------------
(+) Audio quality. The 800 is the best sounding headset I've used period. Even non-surround audio sounds extremely good on this headset.

(+) Audio presets. There's A LOT of sound profiles built into this headset. Take the time to explore and find the ones you like best! I seriously cannot stress enough how much of an impact this makes on audio quality.

(+) Volume. I do tend to read a few other reviews about a product to see how other's impressions stacked up against my own. I noticed that some folks complain about the maximum volume being too low. I didn't find that to be the case at all in my use of the 800 and found the max setting to be uncomfortably loud.

(+) Build quality. This is a seriously nice headset and feels well built and sturdy!

(+) Battery life. Battery life is especially impressive considering the bulk and the amount of speakers this headset is driving. It's hard to estimate exactly how long the charge lasts as my habit is to throw the headset back on the charging stand when not in use. I'd say I'm getting a solid 8 hours of battery life on the occasions that I've purposely let the battery run low.

(+) Lithium. Speaking  of battery I think it's worth mentioning that you're getting a top-notch Lithium-polymer rechargeable battery with the 800.

(+) Weight. Surprisingly for the bulk of this headset it weighs in at only 13oz/370g!

(+) Frequency Response Range. TB advertises a frequency response between 20Hz - 20kHz. Once you try this headset it's a completely believable claim. Low bass sounds rumble satisfyingly while high-end notes and voices are perfectly crisp and clear.

(+) Compatibility. Though not explicitly supported or documented you can definitely use this headset with PC, X360, and Xbox One! I'll mention that on the Xbox consoles the experience isn't technically purely wireless; you'll still need a 3.5mm aux cable to connect to the controller for chat audio. But it's pretty great that you can use this headset across multiple platforms!

--------------------
THE LOWS:
--------------------
(-) Digital audio cable. Turtle Beach cheaped out and threw in a rock-bottom quality digital audio cable. Considering the price this should be a better cable. It gets the job done but extremely cheap and flimsy.

(-) Finger print magnets. The rocker panels on each earpiece are made from highly glossy black plastic (think original PS3) and smudge immediately just by looking at them. No seriously every finger print shows up; doubly if you recently ate Cheetos.

(-) Controls. The inputs are built into the earpieces which is a hassle having to take the headset off or accidentally pressing the wrong button.

(-) Charging. Since the base unit directly interfaces with the PS4 and doesn't have it's own AC adapter you'll have to leave your PS4 in rest mode to continue feeding power to the base unit for charging the headset.

***Special Note on Complaints About Hissing:
Before receiving this headset I read a few reviews that mention this problem. Apparently it's an issue with specific TB headsets. After receiving the headset I was immediately on the ""lookout"" (probably not the best term in this situation) for white noise or background hissing. I have not been able to reproduce that with either my PS4 or Samsung Galaxy S4 while using my 800.

I did, however, have a similar issue on my PC with a non-TB gaming headset that I eventually troubleshot down to my power source. After plugging my PC into a power conditioner I was able to remove that audio hiss. I'll mention that my PS4 (and entire AV stack) is plugged into a power conditioner so that may be why I'm not able to hear a hissing. Certainly this is only my thoughts on why I cannot reproduce this issue and my own experiences with a different headset so not a 100% cause.

--------------------
CLOSING:
--------------------
I know I listed four negatives in ""The Lows"" category but I really feel that each one is relatively minor and not worth dinging the product rating. This is a tremendous headset at a tremendous price (relative to console gaming). But if you're looking for the best out there you'd be hard pressed to find a better sounding headset  for your PS4.

Fans of the Dead Space franchise should be thrilled. I'm not gonna lie....With Dead Space 3 I'm definitely used to where to expect the scares or enemies to pop out at me, but I was still literally crying out loud during the many ambushes and battles that occurred in Dead Space 3.

You'll recall in the first game that each chapter ended with a tram ride, so there was never any question as to when a chapter ended and a new one began. Dead Space 3 is like 2: chapter changes are subtly spelled out on the screen, so if you're not paying attention or just recovering from the latest attack you could easily miss one.

Dead Space 3 is a lot more action oriented, but there are still many moments of terror. And everything is presented (once again) terrifically! You're Isaac Clark and you're again plunged into a necromorph-infested world of nasties.

What's really cool is that Visceral Games listened to those screaming for a co-op version of the campaign. But with co-op there's good news and bad news. The good news is that...well...there's co-op! The bad is that it's only online co-op, meaning my only choice for co-op is to play with some stranger versus playing locally with a friend or one of my sons. So for me...as of this writing....there has been NO co-op. I took a star off my initial overall rating for that, but I put it back because of the super-coolness of the new feature of being able to construct your own awesome weapons that don't require any specific ammo type; all ammo is universal.

The creatures in Dead Space 3 are familiar and scary. When they're not scary they're disturbing. When they're not disturbing they're viciously ruthless, and there are some new ones to look out for. The background sounds are again creepy and send chills down your spine. The background music is orchestrated precisely, and it builds you right up to an anxiety attack when the action starts. The graphics are great and the environmental layout and surroundings are super realistic.

Dead Space 3 is just awesome! If I had to try to find another flaw it would be that the save stations are gone and replaced with auto-save points. If you don't quit at an auto-save, only the inventory that you quit with is saved and you go back to the last auto-save point to start your next session.

Visceral has done it again. Sick. Game. Sadly, Visceral has announced the cancellation of Dead Space 4 due to lagging sales of 3. Too bad...so enjoy this final chapter in the series. And by gosh, if you're new to the series, by all means get Dead Space 1 & 2 as well (they are pretty cheap now here at Amazon!).

The guns in Borderlands sound terrific, they really make this a cool game. And there's lots of guns. Guns, guns, and more guns!

Lots of ammo, too, is required to survive the rigors of Pandora, as you search for the ever-elusive Vault!

There are four characters to choose from, and each has their own skill set. I liked Mordecai, since he gets a great healing item later in the game, but all of the characters have merit as playable roles.

And, to top it off, there is DLC on the disk now. My favorite was the Zombie Island, and I suggest you head there around level 36-37. Armory of Knoxx is still a challenge at levels 38+, so do that one second. Last, but not least, is the intergalactic ninja claptrap episode!

I was hesitant about the PSP, actually I didn't know anyone that even owned one, until I heard about the $169 price drop and started to do my own research on the PSP's capabilities. It is truly endless in its capabilities and possibilities. So let me tell you about what I love the most.

1. The screen is beautiful. It isn't 1080p but it is unrivaled in its clarity and color vividness.  The DS Lite is a great toy with interesting dual screen playability, but the PSP wide aspect screen is simply amazing and makes watching videos extremely pleasurable.

2. The games are quite affordable. I've picked up now 5 games and I spend on average $19 for each of them. Granted most of these games are past hits from a year or more ago, but that is not to say that you won't be entertained. There is a wide selection of good games (GTA LCS, Socom, Tekken, MGS) but there is a whole line-up of future games that will surely make you take notice.

3. The Homebrew community is alive and kicking. I won't go into details about what Homebrew is, but Google around you will quite surprised what people are doing with their PSPs.

4. Internet, video, music... it does it all!

So I wouldn't be fair if I didn't also take a critical eye to certain aspects of the PSP that I wish could be improved.

a. Without a case I do feel the screen can be easily damaged. It doesn't have the image of durability a portable device should have (i.e. iPod or DS Lite).

This game is extremely addicting and very challenging with a fantastic online element. I extremely recommend this game to those who are fans of the FPS genre who are looking for something fresh. Here's why you should own it.

1. The gameplay part A. You control weapon wielding squid person. Sounds cool doesn't it? I thought so. You are armed with the mission to cover everything with your ink! Sounds easy right? WRONG. There exists others who have a different color of ink. These people also have the same mission. This conflict creates an all out WAR! You can also turn into a squid and move very quickly. People will try to surround you with there horrid ink! If those people succeed, you are forced to move back to the beginning. At the end of the game, whoever has the most ink coverage, wins.

2. The gameplay part B. The first part of the game describes the online multiplayer. This part describes the single player mode. The gameplay is basically the same BUT, you have to kill all the aliens to move on. I'm laving a ton of stuff out here, because I don't want to ruin it.

3. The gameplay part C. Sometimes between games you have to wait for a period of time. Boring right. Wrong. Instead why not play a little 8-bit game. In this game you control a jumping squid that must climb its way to the top.

4. Upgrades. As you play more and more online, you eventually start to level up and collect coins. Doing so allows you to get better gear from the shop that will give you a major strategic advantage.

5. Online Multiplayer. Nintendo Delivered! This is one of the first Nintendo games that seriously rewards online gaming! The battles are always 4X4 with a myriad of levels on both sides. It's fantastic.

You have both land and air units and you harvest two types of materials (vespene gas & minerals) to build your structures and units.

I didn't really know anything about Bioshock before sitting down to play it...But once you complete the game, you'll know the entire story behind it.  This is shared through a variety of sources of info during the game.  Starting at Ground Zero means you're going to quickly find yourself transported to an absolutely WEIRD and DISTURBING ""Paradise"" that requires you to simultaneously make value judgments while murdering pretty much everyone who crosses your path...The end result is a whole lot of FUN & GUN gameplay, made even better by supplementing std shooter weapons with a quite diverse and inventive variety of weaponry that will often give you a quilty pleasure when you see what they do to your enemies...

The Plasmids are just plain out WICKED and you'll certainly be glad you're the one using them instead of your enemies.  Torch 'em...Freeze & blast 'em...Or just send a killer swarm of bees on them and watch as they helplessly flail away while screaming their last breaths of life.  Like I said, just WICKED.  Becoming invisible adds so much to the gameplay that you'll probably use it for the entire rest of the game once you acquire the ability.

Rapture is just overflowing with some pretty messed up characters.  It would've made more sense to me if it was set in the future instead of the 40's, since everyone knows the technology required to build an underwater city this diverse and complex didn't exist back then...But since it's a video game so you just kind of accept it and enjoy the experience.

I've played through both Bioshock and F.E.A.R. and from what I read, I expected F.E.A.R. to be edge of your seat ""scary"".  It wasn't.  In fact, Bioshock will have you on the edge of your seat so often, you may fall off a time or two.  But Bioshock is also disturbing on a psychological level.  It's always a DARK environment, like F.E.A.R., but the surprises waiting around the next corner are much more mental and sinister in Bioshock.  The Splicers are absolutely INSANE individuals and Big Daddies will pretty much pursue you until one of you dies.  As for the people now running what's left of Rapture, well the old saying about ""the inmates running the asylum"" couldn't be more appropriate...

Prepare yourself for some immersive gaming and this is one game you won't be finishing in just 10 or so hours...There is much to explore in Rapture once you start and you'll probably devote every free minute to this highly addictive game.  Just don't be surprised if you wake up in the middle of the night and think you see a Spider Splicer heading towards you on your ceiling...",A GEM Of A Game...Even If It's Disturbing At Times,1246579200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

While I too am disappointed that a Colin Mcrae game places relatively little emphasis on THE SPORT that the man made his living by, I'll choose to judge the game on its own merits.

Controls: A+ Slick and tight. I'm too cheap to by a racing wheel, but even using my Dualshock, it's easy for me to pull of sweet drifts and thread the proverbial needle when need be. The way one of the trophy trucks drives is definitely noticeably different from the way one of the rallycross-prepped cars does, and you'll see [and feel] the cars behave differently depending on whether you're driving on grippy tarmac or a loose surface. The punk art, spray paint & stencil look of the navigation buttons, as well as an RV serving as your main menu are an interesting direction, but are ultimately, in my opinion, a waste of disc space that could have been occupied by another car or track. I was perfectly content with the menu system of DiRT 1.

Presentation: A+ If there's even been a game deserving of the term ""eye candy"", this is it. The water effects look great, the cars look great, and I assume the trees flying by me at 90mph would look great if I bothered to look at them. And if there's ever been a game deserving of the term ""ear candy"" this is even MORE it. The audio is simply fantastic; the fidelity of the engine sound of each car, along with the random cracks and pops of the rocks and stones your car flings up, combined with the visuals looks of the game all form optical/auditory sensory nirvana. If you're hooked up to a good sound system and are playing on a good HDTV, the experience will blow your mind.

Other positives:
+ There are many events spanning multiple disciplines, as well as about a dozen countries to race in, each having a very distinct look and feel to its tracks. Great effort was spent in making those tracks beautiful. Some of the best-looking ones are in the China series, in my opinion.
+ In an effort to make the game more immersive, the developers extended playable space several yards off of either side of the track itself. So unlike in many other other games, where you're reset if you stray only a few feet off the course, in this game you can wipeout, somehow wind up 20 feet into the grass, and can, if you don't feel like cheating, drive yourself back. This brings me to another positive:
+ The flashback system, pioneered in Codemasters' other racing game, GRID, can be very useful, but if you're not careful, turn into a crutch. Sometimes out of curiosity I ramp off of a dike and watch my car barrel roll through the air before crashing into the ground, then rewind and continue on with the race.
+ The in-cockpit view is excellent, and comes close to making you feel like you're actually driving.

Negatives:
- I'm not the biggest multiplayer person, but why many developers have stopped including split-screen in their racing games is completely beyond me. Yes I can go online and race against some guy in Sweden, yes I can set up a local network with some other guys that brings their PS3s, but why is it that I can't hand a buddy my extra controller and laugh and point at him after he drifts himself off of the third cliff in a row?
- The numbers of rewards and unlocks aren't dispersed very well. Every time you go up a level, you're going to at least get some new liveries, a new car, some dashboard toys or things to hang from the rearview mirror UNTIL you hit level 30, after which you get nothing. The problem is that you'll be long past 30 by the time you finish the game.
- You can only hear Scars on Broadway's attempt at playing music so many times before you start wanting to strangle somebody.

All in all, I'd recommend this game to anybody who A) needs a rally fix B) needs a general off-road fix C) needs a drifting fix, or D) wants something pretty to show off their sound system and new LCD.

The quick answer is no.  You won't see any enhancements or graphical upgrades or functional differences between the 2 versions.  The only significant advantage that I can report on is that the load times are considerably snappier on the more powerful platform.  That said, Rayman Legends is still eye-candy and the animation is simply stunning regardless of which console you get it on.

If you were on the fence before and haven't picked it up yet, picking it up at its release price of just under 40 dollars is well worth it and you should read my original review below.

[Original Review From PS3 Version]

My daughter and I are quite familiar with platformers in general. In fact, we have been a daddy-daughter team ever since she first played with me on Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. We have also played Super Mario Bros. Wii and others as well.

When I first picked up Rayman Origins (which precedes this title), I knew very little about Rayman in general. I picked up Rayman Origins for $19.99 as a Xmas present. Little did I know what a hit it would be with BOTH of us.

Rayman Legends follows in the same vein as our main, limbless protagonist, Rayman, is once again awakened to rescue the lumas and teensies from the denizens of a multitude of evil characters. Rayman will need to jump, sprint, ""float"" (his ears will whip around like a helicopter), and punch his way to victory. What makes the game even more fun is the ability to have up to 4 people play co-op at the same time, albeit only on the same console. It's still sad that online support is inexplicably absent and it would have certainly encouraged other family members in other cities to purchase it and join in on the fun. However, it's still an absolute blast.

If you loved Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends will stagger you. The sheer volume of unlockable content that is available will ensure the longevity of this title, especially for completionists like me. However, like Origins, if you're into it just to beat the ""main storyline"", so to speak, the game does cater to that level of satisfaction for those of use who don't have the cat-like alacrity to nail every jump perfectly. It's a game that can be enjoyed from both beginners to experts alike, and comical for all.

Special mention should be made to the art direction and music. Rayman Origins had beautiful visuals and Legends (despite being released almost on the heels of Origins) does not fail to disappoint either; I'd almost say that it exceeds Origins if it were possible. I love how level design has moved away from an almost Mario-like stage progression map to a gallery of artwork that your character(s) hop into to get to the levels that you'll play. The music fits the level designs perfectly and the cartoon-like artwork in each level is extremely fluid with no discernible framerate hiccups. It's flawless as a platformer could possibly get and I can't spot a single element in this game that didn't appear to have a great deal of love and attention. The same goes for the level design - everything that can be unlocked in the game is achievable without a single item feeling like a ""cheat"". Truthfully, some areas require a significant amount of skill, but it's skill nonetheless--not poor level design--that will be your only hindrance for getting EVERYTHING.

Rayman Legends is one of the few platformers out there that are worthy of the full MSRP release value. While the online component is still sadly missing, there is still plenty of side-splitting, couch-sharing fun to be had here.",Previously owned on PS3...now I have it on PS4,1392940800,40,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First, it's cute! The art style is just darling, and your animal neighbors (of which there are hundreds; every time you play, you get different ones) are all adorable. I'd take them over humans any day. Houses, trees, your own character; everything is pleasing to the eye and just darn kawaii!

Second, the variety! Besides the vast number of animals that can coexist with you, there's an even bigger number of items to decorate your house, bugs and fish to catch, outfits to wear..the list goes on and on! Every single item actually has a use. The furniture can actually be moved and seen in your house, your catches can be displayed in the museum, and clothes are all clearly visible on your character. Speaking of clothes, if you can't find your own outfit, you can design your own, using a very versatile drawing program. I've designed dozens of outfits, and I still have more in my head. With all the variety, you could play as one character for years--or play as several different characters. The options are endless!

Third, the special events! As time passes, all kinds of things happen. Special items can be collected if you participate in events on holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Halloween. Occasionally, visitors like a fortune teller, a clothes-designing giraffe, and a carpet-selling camel will come to town. If I described everything that could be done in this game, I would overload this site's database.

You have so many options with this game. 100's of autos to choose from. There is also a wheel shop, but the wheel shop could have been a lot better than what it is.
The cups are what makes the games replay value so high. They are tough. They are challenging, and they keep you stuck to your tv. If you are like me, you can't stand to lose, and you lose a lot with this game. Very challenging and keeps you focused. You can spend an hour or two playing this and not even know it.

You can never say you are bored at home when you have this to play.

While similar to Oblivion there really is no comparison because the science-fiction story in F3 is not only leagues ahead but is movie quality on par with anything Valve has had to offer and then some more. F3 is an extremely story driven game and while the single player campaign is maybe shorter than expected you don't have to finish the game at all. You can go about the lands, engage the enemy (or friends) as much as you like. This is a major advantage that this game has. You can play it in so many different ways, do things differently, behave another way, good or bad, and the environment/story will respond accordingly. You can also freely roam the wastelands after you leave your home in a post-apocalyptic vault to venture outside, doing whatever you want and so while the main campaign is possibly undersized, F3 is not short of ways you can play it. In that respect the game is endless.

While the game is like a first person shooter there is also the RPG feature. This essentially means you might have a headshot in your line of site but it's only statistical. There is a special VATS system though where you can let a computer take control of your shot and you see the blast in slow motion and here you can see why the game has an adult rating. Things can get quite gruesome, bloody and severed although maybe a little repetitive in the ways things explode and this is one of the games criticisms (as well as maybe a little sluggish movement and lack of binoculars [but you have a sniper rifle]) but that is where they end. Everything else about this game is magnificent, immersive and addictive.

The wasteland itself is gigantic and is simply one of the most amazing landscapes designs for any game ever. It is flawless, virtually photorealistic at times and there is nothing even remotely like it. Every detail down to a rock crack is like it would appear from a digital camera shot of the real thing. You go on multiple missions around the wasteland visiting shanty towns, mines, destroyed settlements, castles, towers, cities, mountains, deserts and even ships that people are living on. The scope of the different surroundings is without parallel as well as the amount of gadgets you can collect, perks you can achieve and weapons you can trade. It is a do anything game on the scale of grand theft auto. You can either go it alone or go missions. The choice is yours and that is really what the game makers have done. Fallout 3 is all about how you play it. Fallout 3 is all about you.

Pros:
Possible candidate for best game of 2008, maybe ever!

The environment and landscape is celestial

Kinect - The kinect does an amazing job recognizing your body and its movements. The games that I've played on it include Dance Central 2 & 3, Kinect sports, Fruit Ninja Kinect, and Kinect Adventures. Every game is a lot of fun by yourself or with friends. The Kinect also adds a lot of convenience with its voice commands. I can control almost anything just by talking to it. It also remembers what you look like and will automatically sign you in when it ""sees"" you. Also, as far as long term use goes, Microsoft made this product very well. It will adjust itself to get the best camera angle for the space that you are in. Also, the kinect provides a great source of exercise. Playing any of the Kinect games will get your blood flowing and sweat dripping. Its amazing how sore it will make you the next day. It really is a ton of exercise. Lastly, there are no mats, remotes, or other items required.

Xbox Slim - The new design is fantastic. It is quite a bit smaller than its predecessor. The AC power adapter is also smaller, which is really nice. The hard drive is now inserted internally and can be inserted and removed with ease. This gets rid of the awkward bump on the top of the Xbox. Another improvement that really impressed me is the airflow through the console. Its hot air is pushed out of the machine much more effectively than in the previous model. This, in theory, should reduce the amount of RROD that occurs. One aspect of the new console that I wasn't  all too thrilled about are the ""buttons"" to turn on the console and to open the disk tray. They are now touch activated which some people may like but I personally do not.

I also want to share a couple things that I was unaware of when I purchased the console (which I'm sure are easy to find if you're looking but just incase anyone made assumptions like myself). The console no longer comes with HD AV cables. It is now just standard AV cables and some models include an HDMI chord. I personally preferred the picture quality with the HD AV cable over the HDMI. This (after doing some research) turns out to be an issue that people with Samsung TVs have when using HDMI cables. Also, all consoles now come in the matte finish. All of the arcade consoles used to be matte and the others were glossy, but Microsoft finally came to their senses and discontinued the glossy consoles. The Kinect however is still glossy, which perhaps is a good thing since most TVs have a glossy finish.",Amazing,1354838400,10,,

While they could try to find suvstsitutes like the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 in the new generation of home consoles. While those have the hype, they don't completely have the gameplay. The Nintendo DS has proven for the past 3 years, how much fun it is to play on the run, at a affordable price, and the appeals it keeps coming to new fans as well as die hard fans of Nintendo alike. Now, they have their latest bundle for the Nintendo DS, and it is something valued in gold.

The new Nintendo DS Lite Gold Legend Of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass bundlepack, is a compact and convient game system, that you can bring with you on the go. The system works like a charm, as you use your stylus pen to touch your way through many different games like Super Mario 64 DS, and recent titles like Mario Party DS and Brain Age 2. The system is set in a unique gold color, which is appealing to those die hard fan of The Legend Of Zelda series, is a elequent colored design with the trade Zelda Tri-Force stamp of approval, as shown in the look to this limited edition system. On top of that, if you haven't yet cought the Game Boy Advance from the last generation of handheld consoles, you can play your GBA games on the DS Lite, and try to conquer classics like Super Mario Advance 4; Super Mario Brothers 3, Sonic The Hedgehog Genesis, and Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest.

The system also comes with the Legend Of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass game, a sequel to the Nintendo Gamecube title, Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker. It is fun to play, as you guide Link and his crew through this exciting game filled with missions, quests, and puzzles that are sure to blow you away, with the simple control of the stylus that works great with the game. The graphics handle great, while the gameplay brings in a whole new dimension of gameplay which is something we haven't seen in the Zelda franchise as of yet.

All in all, I am a huge fan of the Nintendo DS, and I absolutely recommend The Nintendo DS Gold Legend Of Zelda bundlepack.

The premise starts out with 3 young friends that are treasure hunting.  The Boy (we'll call him Josh, since it's my name) falls into a lake and searches for his way back to Potos Village.  He finds a sword along the way, and it calls out to him.  Josh easily manages to pull the sword.  However, when he returns home, the village Elder is extremely upset and berates Josh.  Even worse, his friend Elliott gets swallowed into a hole, which contains a huge monster!  So Josh has to use his newfound sword to slay the beast!

However, after Josh wins, he doesn't even get a thank you from the villagers.  Instead, they actually BLAME him for what happened by allowing the beasts to take over the world!  Immediately, the Elder permanently banishes Josh from Potos.  :(  So now he has to set off to restore the 8 Mana Seeds which are strewn inside various palaces.  Josh also finds 2 other friends along the way, a girl and a Sprite (it's too hard to tell if it's male or female).

Just like The Legend Of Zelda series, you will battle in live, real-time.  Josh and his friends will acquire 8 weapons: the glove, axe, bow, whip, sword, boomerang, spear, and javelin.  ALL of them will eventually need to be upgraded by Watts the blacksmith.  However, you can't do that without first finding the 32 Weapon Orbs (you can actually upgrade the weapons all the way to Level 9).  Some of them are contained inside treasure chests, some you will get from talking to other characters, or you can also obtain them from defeating bosses.  Please keep in mind to practice with all of your weapons while battling enemies so that your characters become even stronger!

A couple of important other notes:  once the girl and the Sprite gain the power of Mana magic, they can also build up the 8 elementals to Level 8.  The following magic is from Undine, Salamando, Gnome, Sylphid, Shade, Lumina, Luna and Dryad.  Experiment with each magical power to see how it affects the various enemies.  And be sure to use the girl's Analysis magic on the Crystal Orbs -- you need the correct magic in order to open secret passages so that you can progress further into the game.

Halfway through the game, Josh and his friends will gain the use of Flammie, a White Dragon that can take you to otherwise unreachable towns and eventually the Mana Fortress.  And, as with all storylines, there's lots of drama and betrayal involved.  Seriously, you really need to play this game:  the candy coated graphics, enemies, and some of the best lush, relaxed music should be enough to get your attention.  :)

Also, please be sure to pick up Secret Of Evermore (Super NES), Sword of Mana (Game Boy Advance), and Children Of Mana (Nintendo DS).",One of the best adventure/RPG games since Zelda.  :),1410134400,3,,

I had heard great things about this game, and it was among the first I purchased right off the bat.  People talk about the Vita having a lack of games, but I'm not finding that to be the case; there are enough AAA+ titles to keep me occupied for a year, and the Vita only seems to be picking up steam now that the PS4 has become so embedded as the lead console for multiplats and Sony's great exclusives.

This, is another great, great Sony exclusive.  I played Little Big Planet before, and while I appreciated the creativity and innovation, the gameplay was not really enough to hold my attention.  When I learned that the same developers made this title, I was afraid I might have the same reaction.  I definitely did not, though.  This is not a game purely about collecting and exploring; you can do plenty of that, but it's an adventure game, with surprise, after surprise, after surprise.

Tearaway uses every sensor on the Vita, features fun and compelling (and often challenging) gameplay (you will die a lot!), but the key is that they used the *perfect* balance of all of these elements.  The rear touch is used just enough (and in a very cool way); the camera is used just enough, so on and so forth.

And most importantly, the real innovation here, is that as the game tells you a story, you are also creating your own story.  There's something very special and sentimental about this game.  Every person's experience of it is like a snowflake; no two are alike.  You decorate and define the entire universe in-between immersive gameplay.  Probably the most perfect use of any handheld's hardware to date, and definitely one of the best games available on any handheld.  If you have a Vita, this is a must-buy!  You'll never experience another game like this (unless, of course, there's a sequel; but that could be a while!).

Overall, great, great game. I found myself playing this game every morning on the way to work.  My only wish is that it could have been just a little bit longer.  But, to those who criticize it for being ""too short"", I can say this: it took me at least twice as long to finish this than it did to finish the latest Call of Duty (Ghosts) campaign; and that was a $60+ game (clocking in at around 4-5 hours)!  And I didn't even find all the secrets and collectables; there is definitely replay value...  Some of those treasure boxes are extremely tricky to find!  It's a pretty long campaign, all things considered, especially for the price.  Great value great game.  I know I've said it already, but pick this one up!

The previous mouse's right click was on it's way out (I disassembled the mouse after receiving this newer one, and discovered there is a plastic tab that presses down onto the actual switch/actuator that was broken and missing). I super glued a makeshift plastic tab on, but have not tested if it works, but it should... I honestly have no need for it now that I have this newer one...
Got this mainly because I was already used to the 12 thumb buttons I had on the previous mouse I was using, but also because of the LED glow effects. I do a lot of low lighting computer use, and backlighting on keyboards and mice is a must have for me. A huge plus for this mouse is a direct connection to the razer synapse software I had already setup beforehand (for my previous mouse). All my settings switched over near effortlessly, and I received an upgraded feature of the chroma lighting settings I did not previously have access to. I leave the chroma lighting on the OEM ""Spectrum Cycling"" effect, but have installed a chroma app for controlling the lighting based on sound (very neat feature, but would most likely work a lot better on a chroma keyboard, which would display the lighting better than just a few buttons.

Pros:
-Connects and Syncs right up if you already are using Razer software.
-Customizable backlighting
-Decent cable length
-No noticeable latency, or connectivity issues.
-Fully programmable with lighting, buttons, and sensitivity

My only problem with it is that the difficulty isn't consistent, with the bosses at times being incredibly hard, and the other enemies not being too difficult if you strategise effectively. It was a little shocking though, when I was killed in one of my first battles. I think that I went into a cave that I wasn't supposed to be in yet, and it was swarming with dozens of goblin-like creatures. Thankfully, after reloading I was able to run around and use traps and all of my bombs, to take them all out. After that, while there were difficult battles, other than the boss fights, they all seemed fair.

This game is huge, as the whole second act is completely different depending on your choice of who to side with, and the third act is probably different for everyone depending on other choices you make. I really wish that there was some kind of new game+ or you were able to go back to the second act and immediately play out the other side. I would have started the game over immediately, but I really hated going back to being the weak character I was at the beginning. Also, it's going to be great to eventually play through the game all over again in a year or so.

This game definitely has adult features, but it's nothing too crazy, and the graphics aren't great enough to be fascinated by the pixelated breasts. Still, the adult features of the story were very enjoyable, it didn't have to pull punches like a lot of video games. The only thing here, is that I saved Triss, and in the end my Witcher barely got a hug from her. This is part of the problem, while it was really cool where you could end the game with no final boss fight, or you could initiate the toughest fight of the game to get your revenge on the other Witcher that framed you for the death of the King. I didn't like how the ending really just turns into a cliffhanger. I'd love to know how everything turned out, but I'm probably going to have to wait a couple years before I find out. It'll also be very interesting to see how the next game takes your choices into consideration. I would guess that the third Witcher will take place after the war is over, and they can make everything you did before unimportant for the most part, except for a few moments they could craft for each player's different play-through.

Yes, continuing the current trend of ""buy time for making new games by re-releasing old ones,"" the controversial reboot of ""Devil May Cry"" is now out on the PS4 (which is the version I played) and Xbox One with all the bells and whistles you've come to expect with these sorts of releases. Somewhat upscaled graphics? Check. All the DLC bundled in? Check. Somewhat cheaper price point? Check and check. At this rate, it's become less of ""how much has changed"" and more ""how little am I going to regret buying this game twice""? Luckily, Ninja Theory seems to know that more prudent players are dubious of these rehashes, and has done a lot to merit second-time adopters giving this another go... along with making the best version of the product for newcomers.

Is this still the same game that came out in 2013? Largely, yes. The story is the same, of course. Dante is a lovably loudmouthed punk who gets thrown in the middle of an age-old conflict between angels and demons. The latter party controls the world through televised news and soft drinks, among other things. In order to stop their control, Dante, along with Virgil and Kat, learns to tap into his past in order to take down everything keeping America lazy and stupid, then eventually take down the demons behind it all.

I said this in my review two years ago, and I'll say it again: the story here is one of the very best out there, at least in terms of video games. It's a sarcastic, rude pop in the face to the side of America that any rational person despises. There's no ""we need to respect these opinions,"" or, ""they have a right to do this"" sort of diatribe here. The writers don't play nice with the material, and why should they? The best political satires are sharp, focused and mean. This is all of that and then some, and by consequence, it feels like a much more mature satire of American society than, say, ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" which is more content to softly poke at things rather than voraciously attack. As far as political games goes, ""DmC"" is one of the smartest and funniest out there, and while it may liberally borrow from ""They Live"" in some capacity, it does enough with the concept that it feels fresh and original.

Are there any changes to the story? No, not really. There's a small snippet of dialogue cut out (yes, people are already crying ""censorship,"" but please note the developers just didn't care for the line,) a new cutscene added to provide context to something that happens later in the game, and... well, that's about it. Oh, actually, Virgil's dumb fedora got the axe, too, but I'm not sure anyone was too, erm, euphoric about that look the first time around, right? Right. Moving on.

Now, I could go into heavy, heavy detail explaining the numerous, minute changes made to combat here, because that's where the meat of the upgrades lie. But we'd be here for a very, very long time if I talked about all that, and Capcom actually put up a 30-ish page changelog detailing everything new under the hood, so you can just go look at that if you're interested. So I'll keep it brief. Basically, if you button-mashed your way through ""DmC,"" you won't notice a lot of differences here. Maybe you'll see that some bosses are tweaked, or that some enemies take more or fewer hits, but the game will feel basically the same to you. However, if you're one to focus on mastering combos, racking up scores, collecting trinkets, then this is a whole other ballgame. Certain combos don't work the way they used to. It's harder to pull off good Style Combos. A lot of collectibles have been shuffled around. A good portion of enemies react differently to different moves. There's a solid lock-on mechanic. So on, so forth. Again, there are enough changes to merit 30-plus pages of tiny details, but the overall point is that people who love breaking apart a game's mechanics and mastering them will have a field day with this game. The only complaint I might have, perhaps, is that by ""rebalancing"" the gameplay, everything feels a touch easier on the standard difficulty level... but maybe that's just me.

Is the gameplay still good, though? Yes, definitely, 100%. Of course, this game still has numerous detractors, people who will try to explain why it's objectively inferior to the originals, because opinions are apparently facts when it comes to video games. To this day, I don't understand the complaints. Everything about ""DmC"" is smooth as butter. Every button press has a certain weight to it, and if you really focus on learning the intricacies of the combat, each move has a distinct feeling of purpose and meaning behind it. Like other action gaming greats like ""Bayonetta,"" the key to victory isn't blindly spamming the same moves until you win. You have to mix things up and have variation to how you tackle each and every enemy. When consumers these days end up spending sixty dollars on titles that are, essentially, five-hour interactive movies with barely any thought put into the gameplay, a game like ""DmC"" still feels woefully unique... even over two years after its release. Compared to other action games in this vein, Ninja Theory's title is very good. Compared to virtually everything else on the market that isn't on the Wii U right now, though, it's a complete and total godsend.

In the visual department, get ready for a bit of a trade-off. For the first time on consoles, ""DmC"" runs at a full 60 FPS, and it's one of those games where the difference is massive. Action is blisteringly fast, truly capturing the frenetic energy that the game's tone is trying to convey. Nothing feels plodding or sluggish, and there was absolutely never an instance of stalling, chugging, or even screen tearing on my copy. As far as the performance goes, on top of adding the Turbo Mode (which makes the game go 20% faster, adding a whole other level of challenge,) Ninja Theory has hit it out of the park with this version, and deserves serious commendation. That said... the actual visuals are more lukewarm. Artistically, yes, this is still a very visually arresting game, and at 1080p, you can see virtually every detail about it. The way the world comes alive to try and kill Dante, the varied and amusing facial expressions of characters, the vibrant colors... that's all here. But so are a copious amount of lazy textures that just flat-out don't look good, and were obviously not a huge concern to the devs when touching this game back up. While I would argue that this looks leaps and bounds better than most of these ""Definitive Super Ultra Wombo Combo"" editions, it's still not the sort of game that I expected to playing on ""next-gen"" consoles well over a year after their release, and it's still a tad disappointing that this is still where we are. Paying for upscaled versions of last-generation titles. Kind of sad, if you ask me.

I'm not losing much sleep over it, though, because ""DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition"" is still very much worth your money. What with the tweaks in the gameplay department, the new resolution, the improved framerate, all of the bundled DLC, a whole boatload of extras, and on top of that, a very attractive price point... you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. If you have a PS4 or One, and haven't played this already, then it's definitely worth your time and money. It was an excellent title when it came out, and it's only gotten better with all that Ninja Theory has done to it. And for people who picked it up the first time around? I can fairly say that it's the second time, with all of these upscaled re-releases, that I truly feel like the double-dip is worth it (the first being the wonderful ""Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition."") No matter who you are, unless you fall into the ""hating it because it's not like the old ones"" camp, Ninja Theory's take on the venerable demon-slaying franchise is a blast, and this is easily the best version to snag.

And if you do fall into that camp, well, you can play as the original Dante from the outset so... you win, I guess?

Pros:
- Still a funny, well-written game with a likable lead
- Gameplay has been honed to a razor's edge
- 60 FPS makes a lot of difference here.
- Hours upon hours of content

Cons:
- Lazy visuals in some areas
- Feels like a much easier game this time around
- It's another re-release, and I'm kind of tired of them, aren't you?

The game is beautiful and the story is very engaging. You immerse yourself into its lore by observing the moving environment. All the civilians of Columbia are active and you feel that you are really in a new world, most notable moments are the singing quartet in the beginning of the game, where Elizabeth is dancing with a crowd to a jig that a pianist is playing, and when you interact with a guitar and Elizabeth begins to sing along. As a precaution there ARE alot of mature content that involves racist content. Now don't be a baby and cry about why this is in the game but think about it, the games religion is set on George Washington and Abraham Lincoln as the Fathers of Columbia. 1 favors slavery while the other abolishes. 2 factions, 1 is a dominant pure race while the other is trying to break free from suppression from the other. You can fill in the dots yourself. Gameplay is straight forward and all you do is pick up and play. The combat in this game is just like standard Bioshock controls where you click on the right thumbstick to aim down the sight--might be awkward for a few minutes but you get use to it-- and I highly recommend playing this game on Hard difficulty for the added challenge. This game is way too easy if you are not the kind of person who wants to know about the game universe and explore all the knooks and crannies of the game.

Also for the full benefit of the game and story, its really worth picking up the audio logs--Voxophones as they call them-- and learning about what the story is and how its connected to the previous games. Once you acquire enough information you can kind of make out what the Ending is telling you. The ending by the way is a refreshing story of vengeance and liberation. At the end you think there are multiple endings but there is not, it concludes itself on 1 solid path and keeps you wondering. Stay after the credits! I left alot out such as the perk system where you wear different sets of clothing(you don't see it) to add different minor abilities such as dealing elemental damage with melee attacks or earning Silver Eagles(ingame currency) for finding audio logs, the handful of ""Plasmids"" that are available, and the different types of weapons you can equip during the game(can only carry 2). I left this review a tad short so that you can go experience the game yourself without giving too much away. I will definitely highlight the pros and cons!

Pros:
+ Same Bioshock feel through controls and environment(If you don't mind little changes to gameplay)

+ An amazing storyline that is sure to keep you wondering and talking about it

+ Creative perk system and new plasmids

+ A solid 5-7 hours of gameplay on Hard Difficulty while keeping an eye out for Audio Logs and learning about the game

Cons:

- Most of the graphics are kind of outdated and some of the images are notably horrid. For instance when you reach an area where there are bushes examine the rose buds. Its all pixelated and messy. But from far away it looks normal so it shouldnt bug you.

- Alot of gunplay involved. Most of the time I forget I have plasmids on hand to use.

- When you die you can come back to life(also gives enemies alittle more health back as well) and gives you some ammo and removes some Silver Eagles from you. This is kind of broken and offers no strategy when you dive into a group of enemies. You can literally just keep dying without worrying about much other than your Silver Eagles.

- The game is alittle glitchy and buggy during some parts of the game. When you try to collect resources there are no options to collect it and it just sits there. When Elizabeth is locked in her speech and has to activate a door or lever she stand there indefinitely.

Overall I give this game a high rating of 5 out of 5 stars, It should be 4 out of 5 due to the long wait period and lack of new features and extra content.

This makes the story more dynamic and less predictable unlike many other jrpgs where the main cast is together till the end and have a happy ending in the end.

The graphics are just ok but graphics is not everything in a game. The battle system is very entertaining with tons of options and other in depth opportunities to make you engage with more detail into it (although it becomes a little bit too gimmickish sometimes).

This helps the buyer organize what they need to connect the headphones to what they bought them for. For instance it has extensive instructions to connect the headphones to Xbox 360, PCM, Mac, tablets, and phone devices. They also provided the a multitude of connection cables to connect to the devices previously mentioned, again in nice packaging.

Physically the headphones are borderline perfect. The ear muffs fit perfectly around the ear with a nice type of fabric that allows proper breathing of the skin. Adjustment of the ear pieces is easy  and helps adjust the ear pieces so that they may fit any bulbous head like my husband's! It does have  gorgeous and comfortable leather stitching and padding on the portion that connects both ear pieces. The mic can easily be adjusted to the comfort ability of the user and there is no doubt that the arm of the mic can be configured in any position desired by the user.

Part of the physical nature of them is that they provide plenty of cord so that you can be a comfortable distance from the TV or gaming system.  the px22 portion of the cable provides a clip on the back of it so that you can attach it to your shirt.  I don't own an XBox 360 and did not use the clip feature or any other features that help with the xbox gaming console.  However as a constant WOW player for the past 8 years, my husband did  enjoy the px22 having the many options of volume for speaker, mic, overall volume, bass, and treble.  I found it to be easily accesible to my mac desktop.  The best part is that you can leave the px22 sound option box attached to the computer attached via usb and music jack, and disconnect it so that the headphones become free with a 2 foot music jack that you can easily plug into almost any smart device.  This leaves the bulky stuff behind on your main gaming system and you can use the headphone on your tablet or smartphone devices without lugging around extra stuff.

My husband used the mic on a casual quest that involved 4 other guild members in WOW and they said that they could hear him loud and clear and the volume for voice and sound can be separately controlled on the device that is attached.  Again, with this device the user can control the amount of bass and treble and thus the sound can be individualized to the users preference.

I've only had it a couple days but have been playing it frequently and find it hard to pull myself away. I've completed most of the goals but to each new explored area you receive more goals or ideas that your sim wants to accomplish. Keeping your sim happy gets harder as you pick up new motives which you always need to keep up so they don't become depressed or too angry to do things. You can choose to play with only one sim but you'll need to find alternative sources of social interaction. When choosing more crew to travel with you, You can only choose one to start with and you end up stranded alone. You must explore and find your crew and when you accomplish certain goals you will be able to switch to play as the other sims and you can assign them different jobs which they will do when you are currently not playing them.

5.0,False,"08 9, 2006",A2EAI4948TW53X,B000B43OY4,Alexander Scavello,"Ah, true next generation gaming. Beyold the greatness of Xbox 360! I can honestly say there are SO many reasons to purchase a 360. Granted it had some issues when it first came out (since corrected so I've heard) but practice makes perfect! This system is very affordable for what you get with it. But honestly, if given a choice go for the platinum package. I'll explain later in detail.

So why do I think Xbox 360 is so good? Well, first off it's not made by SONY, that's a HUGE plus. Second, it's the next generation of a system that was REALLY good, the original Xbox. Third, it has great games to go along with those pretty graphics. It's afforable, albeit a little bit pricey to get started, but if you think about it, it's worth it. And last, IT'S GOOD!

I honestly only have one complaint about it so let's get that out of the way. I can't play all of my old xbox games on it. There I said it! If this thing had 100% backward compatability it would be perfect. Other than that, I have NO COMPLAINTS WHAT SO EVER. So let's go on to the positives

The price. Yeah it's a little costly at first. But when you put it all together for what you get you are actually ending up with a bargain. Honestly, spend the extra 100 bucks for the platinum edition. The stuff you get with it alone makes it worth the extra cost. You get the hard drive, which beats the heck out of a memory card anyday. You get a headset, which I have only used once but that's because i'm really not into the whole online gaming thing. You get a wireless controller (the way to go) which is SO SWEET compared to the old style short cord controllers. All you need at that point (OPTIONAL, if YOU want it) is a rechargeable battery pack ($30, includes a rechargeable battery) You get a free month of Xbox live gold, followed by lifetime free silver membership. You get the awesome Xbox live. All in all a GREAT deal

So what else? Games, PLENTY of them, and MANY MANY MANY good ones to chose from. Sure Xbox will never have the star power of mario or zelda, but they have plenty of great titles to chose from. No shame in second place. Really, their are too many great titles to list, it goes on and on. And while other companys (SONY) only care about graphics, these games are GOOD to go along with some of the best visuals you'll ever see. The graphics on these games is amazing, and i don't even have an HDTV. My TV is 3 years old and it still looks awesome. the games are EXTREMELY reasonable in price, most are the same or SLIGHTLY higher than those for the original Xbox. I will never mind paying 60 bucks for an Xbox game because I am confident it will be well worth it.

The next thing I have to mention, XBOX live. Wow, I am very impressed. You can download all kinds of stuff. They have awesome retro gaming. Granted there are not many titles yet and their is no way they will compete with Wii's virtual console..but who cares? It's not like it's sony and it's going to suck! The Xbox live arcade has many of my favorite games from when i was a kid (Time Pilot, gauntlet, joust,  street fighter, etc) to go along with great puzzle games from yahoo (bejeweled, zuma, jewel quest, etc) and a slew of new games as well ( I love feeding frenzy, a crazy fish game) Many of these titles are affordable using points you can buy either online through your xbox (the easiest way) or with a gift card available just about anywhere. You can also use points to buy background themes, gamer pictures, etc. There are free game demos and trailers of upcomming titles, though it takes time to download. No Big Deal!

You can also connect wirelessly with your computer like I do using a free downloadable program (to your computer, not xbox) called windows media connect (look online at microsoft) and listen to any song you have stored on your computer, look at any pictures you have stored on your computer, look at videos, etc. Sony PSP's have trouble accessing SONY computers? Why mess with that company when microsoft gives you everything you need? You can watch dvds as well. Even buy a remote if you want

Many people cried about issues when it first came out, overheating, breaking easily, etc. I waited to get mine until Dead rising came out and i have not had ONE problem, NOT ONE. NO DEAD PIXELS OUT OF THE BOX LIKE A COMPETITOR. However, I highly recomend a service plan with microsoft. You get thirty days from purchase to get one ( i did ) and if you get a 2 year plan it's even cheaper. For all the money you just spent it's worth it. Well worth it.

I hope this helps those who may be thinking about purchasing a 360 (DO IT!) and makes those who already own it proud to know we are better than anything sony has. Sony should change there name to SORRY. I HIGHLY recomend the xbox 360 to anyone. It is BEYOND well worth the price you pay, it's a steal actually.

And the pattern that is infused onto the grips allows for a small amount of air to circulate which helps prevent sweaty hands with long gaming sessions. He didn't have the trigger stops installed so I really can't speak to those. I just used the grips themselves and they really are outstanding in every regard.

As great as these grips are, they do add another $25 to the cost of your controller so your basically at roughly $75 for an Xbox One controller and these grips. Obviously if your using them with the controller that came with your console then its just the additional $25, but if your buying a new Xbox One controller along with these grips then your basically at the $75 price level. The reason I bring this up is because I recently upgraded to Xbox One's Elite controller and that controller is by FAR the single best gaming controller I have ever used. I actually think the grips on the Elite controller are a bit more comfortable than these grips and of course, the Elite controller comes with a whole slew of additional features. IMO, the paddles on the bottom of the Elite controller are the best thing to happen to game controllers the last 10-15 years running. They are amazing and super comfortable to use. Plus you can set up the controller any way you want and even adjust the sensitivity of the sticks. So basically, if your looking to buy a new controller along with these grips, your already at $75. That means you could update to the Elite controller for an additional $75 and believe me, its more than worth it. Just something to think about if your about to spend $75 on a new Xbox One controller and these grips. As comfortable as these grips were, I really missed my Elite controller while I was gaming at my buddies house.

Still, if you can't afford the Elite controller or have no desire to spend that much money on a game controller, these grips are a great way of upgrading your regular Xbox One controller. They really are super comfortable and will make gaming sessions all the more enjoyable. If your looking for a quality grip for your Xbox One controller....well, you can't go wrong with SCUF grips.

5.0,True,"09 25, 2008",A1VCJKQUUDV6SL,B000KGD1GO,T. Romano,"I have been waiting a long time for Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway to come out.  There have been numerous delays and the game was supposed to come out sometime last year.  Well it finally came out and I picked up the game yesterday from my local Game Retailer.

The game follows up the first two Brothers in Arms games that came out earlier.  You play the role of Sergeant Matt Baker who leads squads of men through Holland during Operation Market Garden in September 1944 during World War II.  Operation Market Garden was the last German victory in Europe during the war.

I think the game has a great story line.  The game in my opinion is very well done and acted out. It really shows what I think every soldier has to endure and go through during wartime.  It is very emotional and gripping.  You find out that soldiers have to make life or death decisions that can effect them the rest of their lives.  This game shows not only soldiers struggling through this conflict, but also Dutch civilians who were caught in the crossfire between the Allies and the Germans.

If you are looking for a game where you make tactical decisions about how to fight battles during Operation Market Garden, this is it.  Your decisions can decide the life's of your soldiers under your command.

The AI is very good in this game.  I read some game reviews from other gaming websites where the game reviewers were complaining about German Soldiers who were just standing around when you shoot at them.  First of all, you can now sneak up on German Soldiers to plan an attack without them knowing your there.  In other words, you can set up an ambush. You set up you and your squads where you want them to fight the Germans.  Of course the Germans are going to stand around if they don't know that you are there hiding.  Second you can now set up you and your men where the Germans are caught in a cross fire when you fire at them with your weapons.  The Germans get confused because there is no where to run and hide. So of course a lot of them are going to stand around because of the crossfire.  That happens in real life too.

The graphics are real good in this game.  I understand the developers of this game went to actual locations around Holland and took thousands of pictures to make the game looked like Holland during World War II. That is very impressive.

 I think the game has a lot of replay value to it because the Germans react differently every time you play the game again.  Each time you try to figure out how you will fight different battles throughout the game. I recommend buying this game especially if you like playing World War II games like me.

October 5, 2008

UPDATE: I just finished playing Brothers in Arms: Hells Highway and I noticed a couple of things I wanted to update about this game. I'm a true gamer who likes to give honest opinions about the games I play. The above opinions were given when I was only half way through the game. Here are the updates.

1. The graphics are great at the beginning of the game and toward the middle, but not at the end. It seems like the game developer got into a big hurry to finish this game and just threw in graphics from the ""Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood"" game into the end of this game. The trees and buildings at the end of game just look dull and not very detailed like at the beginning and the middle of the game. The game was already a year behind schedule and I'm sure the game developer got pressured into finishing the game as soon as possible. I was wondering why I never saw any game trailers that show any missions that were at the end of this game. Now I know why.

2. None of the mission maps you play through are very big throughout the game. You play a little way through a mission and then you get a cut scene. That scenario plays over and over again throughout the game. Too many cut scenes and not enough playing time. If you want a comparison in map sizes, try playing Battlefield: Bad Company and you'll see what I'm talking about as far as map sizes go. Battlefield: Bad Company maps are a lot bigger with less cut scenes.

3. Operation Market Garden was all about the Allies taking and holding major road bridges along Hell's Highway throughout Holland during World War II before the Germans could blow up any of the bridges. Well in the game I didn't see one major bridge shown in any missions. There is one small bridge in the game that goes over a small canal but I don't count that. I'm talking about big huge bridges over major rivers. I didn't see any at all. I was really disappointed. Why were there no major road bridges shown in the game? That is what Operation Market Garden was all about.

4. There were lots of different vehicles used during Operation Market Garden by both the Allies and the Germans. In the game, I only saw one kind of Allied tank (Sherman Firefly) used in the game and one kind of German tank (Panzer IV) used. I didn't see any German Panther tanks, Tiger tanks, German Halftracks, German Volkswagen Kubelwagen, etc. I also didn't see any other American tanks or any British tanks of any kind. What is up with that?

5. Not every mission in this game has you play with squads of men. In fact in some of the missions, you fight alone against the Germans. And in some missions you don't fight at all. Running through a building that is on fire is one of them. There is no shooting at all. I thought in every mission I would control squads of men.

This game reminds me a lot of Medal of Honor: Airborne. That game could of been awesome too if it had of been done right. I remember that game went through a lot of delays just like Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway did and it came out about a year later than it was suppose to. Medal of Honor: Airborne was great the first few missions and then it went downhill the last couple of missions. This game is the same way.

The great thing about this game is that even though you play it multiple times, if you choose a different type of character, it will unlock different quests. That being said, this game has taken me months to play. The graphics are very basic (as it is 10 years old), but the storyline is interesting and trying to manage relationships, money and inventory is quite challenging and time consuming. I like how you can vary the game's difficulty from 'novice' to 'insane' (at any time) and choose your characters' responses when he/she talks to other NPC's. Your party members do not always agree with you and almost all of them have their own objectives. Some might even betray you. It's a good idea to save your game frequently as exploring some areas becomes quite intricate and picking up (or looting) items takes time. The battles are more than hack n' slash as you need to consider your weapons, armor, spells, protection and positions for all six characters. Sometimes, I encountered a 'bug' when another important characters wouldn't talk to me but re-loading a saved game usually fixed that. Graphically, it's not like some newer games, but an incredible amount of work went into this game.

She stands on a pose.  Her paint is flawless, specially on those expressive big eyes.  She stands on a stone and grass walkway.

Her main attack (press Triangle button on PS3 controller) consist of a series of swings with her purse.
Her ranged attack (press R2 button on PS3 controller) consist of throwing her purse at a target, which automatically returns to her.
Her dodge (press Circle button on PS3 controller) consist of skipping front and back and dancing spins side-side.
His special ability (press R1 button on PS3 controller when full meter) consists of causing her target to attack other enemies.

A lot of people compare this to Apple TV and Roku. With a name like Playstation TV that's a common misunderstanding because while it does share some streaming features with the PS Vita, that is not it's primary purpose. I'm sure the necessary apps will come out soon but the PS TV is amazing for people looking to play their Vita games on their TV or a bigger screen than the 5 inches that the PS Vita provides. I own all the popular PS Vita games but I've only tried two , plus a demo. The Demo was Minecraft and it surprised me that additional buttons were already being used that the Vita does not have such as L2, R2, L3 click , R3 click. So Some games will have full use of the PS3 or PS4 controller that you are using with the PS TV. The other two games I played are Freedom wars which looks great ( like a PS3 game ) on the big screen and the other game ( my prime reason for buying this product) was Persona 4 Golden. This was my first time playing it and I wanted to finish the game on the big screen and I have to say it was worth it. There are clearly more details on the big screen. I'm able to notice more about the games and feel more immersed than on the Vita.
The System does allow you to choose between 720p and 1080i ( I think 480p). I am mostly using 720p since it appears smoother to my eye and does not look less sharp but I'm not even certain if the game is being rendered at a higher resolution or just upscaled. Either way the difference is noticeable as you can clearly see more detail so for this reason alone the PS TV is worth it.
I'll be playing future games on the system no doubt, everything about it is very fun and the system size is tiny, speaking of games I did try a PSP game ( Gods Eater Burst) and it looked terrible, very low resolution , I'm not sure if I missed a setting to help with the scaling but I tried looking for settings and did not find the option.
That's my only con, PSP games are almost unplayable  I didn't try a PS1 game but if I do at some point I'll update my review.

5.0,True,"11 3, 2012",A11L1MD4AIYKB4,B007FMSDUK,Nona,"A few years ago, a little known game from Japan called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-Hours-9-Persons-9-Doors/dp/B003VR5PPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors</a>&nbsp;made its way to the United States.  The game was a visual novel interspersed with escape room puzzles.  If you're unfamiliar with the visual novel genre, it is a reasonably popular type of game in Japan which typically contains a branching story, lots of text (occasionally with voice acting), static visuals, and music.  Visual novels are not popular in the United States, which explained why 999 came in under the radar.  Nevertheless, it quickly received strong praise from Western reviewers.  What distinguished 999 from its other visual novel brethren?  Besides the fact that it got translated to English, 999 had fantastic writing, an incredible story, and interesting characters.  At the time of its release, the creators of 999 were unsure whether they would make a sequel, and the main writer (Kotaro Uchikoshi) publicly made it known that whether a sequel would be made would depend in large part on the reception 999 received both in Japan and in the US.

Well, 999 did sell well enough to justify making a sequel, and this game is it.  Like its predecessor, it is still a visual novel interspersed with escape room puzzles, so if you've played 999 you have a good idea what to expect here.  If you haven't played 999, I *very strongly* recommend playing 999 before playing this game.  While the story of Virtue's Last Reward stands by itself reasonably well, you will gain a better appreciation of the themes and characters in VLR if you have first played 999.  (There's also the fact that this game spoils a large part of 999.)

What's different between VLR and 999?  The major changes include a shift from 2d to 3d models, voice acting for everyone except the main character, and an explicit flowchart which keeps track of your progression in the story.  Initially, I was skeptical of some of the changes, especially the addition of voice acting, but after playing the game I think all of these changes are for the better.  The visuals look sharp, the voice acting is really good, and the flowchart makes it so that you never have to solve the same puzzles twice even if you want to explore all the branches of the story.  (In other words, the flowchart not only provides a visual representation of the branching nature of the story, it also allows you to jump to any part of the story you have seen and change your decisions or replay the puzzle or novel sections of the game.)

If you've played 999, you know that it has one of the most mind-bending, insane stories in all of games (or for that matter, all of popular media).  I don't want to give anything away about the story in VLR, but I think it's safe to say that the story does a good job of keeping you hooked and provides its fair share of ""omgwtf"" moments.  Like its predecessor, the story could only be told in an interactive medium like video games (in other words, you couldn't make a book or TV adaptation without heavily distorting the structure of the plot).  The characters are probably even better developed in VLR than 999, which partially is a function of the fact that VLR is substantially longer than 999.  Zero III is one of my favorite game characters of all time (up there with GLaDOS from Portal), and his/her voice actor is simply brilliant in this game.

The puzzles are more or less of the same flavor as in 999.  You find yourself stuck in a room (or complex of rooms) with a few other characters, and need to figure out a way to open a safe which contains the key to exit the room.  This typically involves exploring the environment - unlike many escape room puzzles, all objects you need to obtain are in plain view and easy to interact with - and then solving some sort of logic puzzle.  These puzzles range from easy to fairly hard, but if you're not an expert at puzzles, don't worry: the game provides an easy mode where the other characters will give you hints on how to proceed.  In contrast, on ""hard mode"" (which is the default mode), they will give you very few hints, and the ones they give you are often either cryptic or obvious.

I only have a few negative comments about the game.  I purchased the Vita version, and I found the touchscreen controls to be slightly less accurate than the stylus controls for 999 on the Nintendo DS.  This is especially noticeable when you try to write (you can keep notes in the game) using your finger, but you can probably get around this by using a capacitive stylus.  Also, the heavily branching nature of the game lends itself to a fair amount of repetition, since at any given branch point there's still a considerable amount of overlap in the events that follow regardless of the choice you make.  Fortunately, you can fast-forward through text you've already seen.  The branching can also make it hard to remember the preceding events in whatever path you are currently on, because of the extensive amount of jumping between paths necessary to complete the game.  (On the other hand, this feeling of disorientation was probably intentional...)  Still, these are minor quibbles, and others might not find these issues to be a problem.

In summary, VLR is a great sequel to 999.  It's one of the best games available for the current generation of handhelds.  If you're a fan of 999, get this game.  If you haven't played 999 before, but enjoy great stories and puzzles, get 999 first, finish it (make sure to get all the endings), and then get this game.  It's a shame that games like this aren't more common in the United States, because 999 and VLR are some of the best games made in the past few years.",A worthy successor to 999 (spoiler-free review),1351900800,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Three perfectly balanced and yet very different races battle it out. There's not too much micromanagement to kill you, but enough for you to feel a part of the race you're playing. I love to play the extra scenerios that they created for one time battles. You can modify them or even create your own from scratch. I just wish they had a random map maker. It would be easier then. You can, however, go online to Blizzard and download tons of scenerios that other gamers made. While the graphics aren't state of the art anymore they still are pretty nice. This game allows for both a strategic approach or the full rush type of battle. You have both land and air units and you harvest two types of materials (vespene gas & minerals) to build your structures and units.

5.0,False,"01 22, 2013",A2G44NES0MQOAC,B0002IBEGO,ycnan,"I recently purchased Chulip for the PS2 slim and I'm not sure whether or not to write this review being that I'm willing to bet most people haven't heard of this game. It's an obscure third party exclusive that doesn't really fit into any genre. Here's my review-

Graphics-

If you've ever read or watched one of those quirky Manga shows/mags then the graphics will be quite familiar. However, if you're not familiar, this means big heads, exaggerated expressions and various effects ""popping around the head"" to signify anger, embarrassment, sadness etc.
The graphics are quite good with a steady framerate, crisp visuals and lots of color. Some gamers may be put off by the cartoonish appearance of this game, but I was thoroughly impressed with the graphics, especially being that it's a PS2 game. It honestly looks like an above average Gamecube title.

Sound-

I loved the soundtrack. It's a mix of ""weird music"", a little jazz and upbeat or solemn tunes. The voice acting is rather strange being that characters sound as if they're speaking Japanese but they're not. Instead, this game features an extensive amount of jumbled dialog that is comparable to the ""teacher from Charlie Brown"".
My only gripe with the sound is that certain environmental sound effects are looped such as water or birds. (the water is much more noticeable)
Also, the sound effects for walking are way too loud. Footsteps sound like really loud tapping and there's no way to even the sound out.

Gameplay-

Easily the best aspect of this game would be the gameplay. It's very hard to even describe this game being that you'll have to play it in order to get a better sense of it.
Anyway, Chulip is a game about ""your character"" falling in love with ""a girl"" and ""you""(whatever your name is) will have to pull off certain tasks in order to ""woo"" this ""girl"".
You'll take on tasks such as randomly kissing townspeople to gain experience, writing love letters or perhaps getting clues from new characters introduced in the game. There's no fighting, but there's al ot of puzzle aspects without it really digging too deep into puzzles. You're never stuck doing one thing too long, instead, this game sort of tosses new things at you to keep the game fresh and not so repetitive. The key to this game is humor which it has a lot of.
For example, you can randomly kiss old people or even men just to gain experience and during pulling off this move, some music will play and perhaps you'll get fireworks effects or a bunch of hearts. To some, it may sound stupid (which it is) but it also is pretty funny to watch.
This is  such a quirky game that I really can't describe much of it because the story is variable and the experience is a one of a kind feeling.

If you have a PS2, this is a must buy game and I highly recommend this game for anyone willing to experience the most ""different"" gamepklay experience possible. Few games are able to say they're as quirky as this one.",An excellent PS2 exclusive,1358812800,,,

This game also includes some new power ups that make some fun unique game play.  It also has a vast array of levels like the traditional Mario games with multiple worlds/themed areas that offer a lot of variety to the game.  Some levels have fun easy to solve puzzles that are required to advance and others have some more advanced puzzles that will take some mastering before you can advance.

The game lets you play with up to four players at a time and with my five kids, my wife, and I all loving the franchise we play this one a lot.

5.0,True,"08 26, 2011",A20G2WK0I98O0I,B001TOQ8R0,Sean O&#039;Skea,"I don't understand the fuss about DRM. Assassin's Creed II is a vast and exciting game. Did you watch the credits at the end of the game? Did you see the hundreds of designers, developers, voice actors, etc all over the world that it took to make a game this stunning? In an age when the pirated copy of a game shows up on line the day before its market release, we have only ourselves to blame if developers need to find new ways to protect their work.

I avoided DRM games for years believing all the hype until finally buying and playing AC2. I played the entire game without even one crash, server lockout, pop-up ad, spam--nothing. And sorry, the argument that you can't play DRM games on a plane? Really? Are you going to play a game like this on a plane? It's a little intense for the tray-table.

I think the online DRM is far better than having to find the dang disk every time you want to play. Better than having the CD spinning, sucking battery life and putting mileage on your drive. In an age of WoW the argument that ""I have to be online all the time"" makes no sense. I almost suspect all the negative reviews complaining about DRM are spam from disgruntled hackers.
So if you were like me and passed up games like AC for fear of some big brother corporate intrusion, don't be. The only drawback is that it takes several steps to start the game and quit. That's it. The dozens of 1-star reviews have nothing to do with the game and do a disservice to the developers and designers.

Now for the game itself, I'm not a big fan of 1st-person shooter/slasher but this game is amazing if for nothing else than the sheer vastness of its environment. You are set free in Renaissance Florence and Venice as well as several other smaller Tuscan hill fort towns. You can literally get lost for hours springing from rooftops. The voice acting and character animation is some of the best I've ever seen. Unlike other games where the characters get recycled over and over, each of the dozens of NPCs you encounter is unique. Even the townspeople crowding the streets show remarkable variety.

I highly recommend using a USB game controller. There are A LOT of button commands, many of them involving timed combinations, and finding the right keys while leaping off tall buildings being chased by half of the city watch, is beyond my manual dexterity. But my $15 Gigaware controller did just fine.

The story is needlessly complicated in my opinion. The motives for our young avatar are clear enough without the strange X-files/Da Vinci Code global conspiracy thing. The (fortunately infrequent) interruptions into the present-tense of the game are a distraction.

It is important to note AC2 shares more DNA with Mario Bros than Myst. It's really about finding the best route to run across the rooftops and ambush your victim. There are very few things to `figure out' and the few times our hero has to interact with objects they are highlighted with glowing diamonds. Once you learn a tactic (i.e. use courtesans to distract the Codex guards) you can use it over and over with the same effect. Sadly, there were few times in the game when I was surprised by the action.  I'd happily trade a few sq miles of game space for a little more of an intellectual challenge to the missions. Whenever I tried to get clever and work out an elegant plan, it always ended up in failure with the successful option usually running up to your mark, stabbing him, and running away as fast as possible. The guards are tediously clueless. You can slowly pick off guys keeping watch on a tower one by one (ten little Indians style) without any of them catching on. ""Hey, where did Mario and Tony go? They were just here..."" Combat is pretty easy too. For all the dozens of tactics available, locking onto an opponent and wailing away on him with `Attack' usually does the job.  The guards rarely break out of their polite ninja movie style one-at-a-time attack. I hope Revelations makes the opponents a bit more cunning and demands more recon and strategy on the gamers' part.

But that aside, the environment is truly stunning. I've never encountered a game with so much space. I played addictively for weeks and I know there are areas I never explored. While the back alleys are filled with clones, there are dozens of unique landmarks all over the game. It's great fun to climb to the top of the Giotto's Campanile, or run across the roof of St. Mark's Basilica on your way to assassinate a corrupt Doge. I don't know if it's a game you'll want to replay they way I revisit old friends in the Myst franchise or conquer the world over and over with Civilization games, but for a few weeks, I expect you'll be transfixed by this stunning game.",Don't Fear the DRM.

For example, your first day on the job at a creepy mansion, you spill your purse and now have to find the contents. You have to babysit creepy kids at the creepy mansion (one of which has a strange ""skin disease"") and have to make them cocoa to get them to go to bed. Then you have to find their mom's cocoa recipe and all the ingredients in their kitchen. Some might find this part silly, but it does play a part in building your character as a babysitter. It does get a lot scarier, and later you have to play hidden object to find your means of escape from the house and find out what is going on with the scary kids and their secret friend that calls you on the phone saying ""GET OUT"". Then the kids go missing. If you're like me you're wondering why the babysitter doesn't just call 911 and get the freak out of there. But that wouldn't be very entertaining, would it? This is a worthwhile game to buy if you like the cheap thrills of a good cheesy horror movie.

This is my first experience with a mechanical keyboard other than messing ones on display in stores and after messing with the keys on a display model I decided to buy this and I am very happy with my decision. First off I am used to the plain old $25 membrane keyboard that you can go pick up at Walmart and use with ease but after using this, it will be hard to go back. Yes it is that good.

Pros:
For the pros I am looking at the over all performance of the keyboard and aesthetics. I like how the keys feel when pressed. Again since I am used to membrane it I used to mashing the keys all the way to the bottom but with this I do not have to as I hear a pleasing click with each key press(my sister says it sounds smarter an more professional). Next is the LED's. I have read a lot of reviews that say the LED's can go bad and I hope that does not happen but form what I am seeing they are phenomenal and I love how I can change the brightness and the gaming setting that only lights up numbers 1-6 and the WASD keys. Since I am a gamer that is very helpful. The next thing on my list of pro's are the multimedia function keys, they are better than my previous keyboard that even though it did have them, they were nowhere near as decent feeling as these. Now onto the construction of the board. It is made from aluminum and weighs slightly less than my laptop (6.1 lbs). It feels very sturdy unlike a Razer keyboard I used to own and the added palm rest is very natural feeling and comfortable.

Cons: Honestly I can't think of any at the moment, Corsair is a such a trustworthy brand that I trust it will have very few issues.

Other: A few things that should be noted about this product are as follows: The palm rest while comfortable, is made of plastic. It feels very durable but other than that I am not sure about how long it will last but I will update this review if and when needed. The next thing to be aware of is the USB dongle that powers it. Unlike most keyboards that I am familiar with this one needs two USB ports to operate it, not one. So be prepared to give up an extra port for an awesome product.

With this I leave the rest up to the purchasers who might read this review and the countless others and decide on their own which keyboard to buy(this one). I will recommend this to any professional writer or anyone that games.",Best Keyboard I Have Ever Owned,1409184000,,"{'Size:': ' Standard', 'Color:': ' Black'}",
5.0,False,"04 10, 2004",A24M1DAMRGDL,B00002STGU,Nick,"Star Fox 64 is one of the most fun games I've ever played. It was one of the first N64 games to utilize the Rumble Pak (it was also one of the first to include voices for all the characters). The premise of the game is simple: you, as Star Fox, are trying to save the solar system from the evil Andross. To do this, you hop in your space ship and blow tons of enemy crafts to bits. The game is simple but fun and can be replayed over and over. I've played through Star Fox 64 more times than any other game I've ever owned.
The Good:
The Gameplay is fast paced, simple and fun. Action packed- there is never a dull moment.
The controls are tight and are perfect.
The level design is excellent.
The force feedback through the Rumble Pak makes the game feel more intense.
The replay value is through the roof- there are many different ways to get to the final boss.
All characters have voices!
Lots of Secrets!
The Bad:
The ""multiplayer"" game is really really bad. It's so bad that it is not worth playing. But that's what Goldeneye is for, right?
The graphics, by today's standards, are outdated
Some of the voices are pretty annoying (Slippy in paticular)

Little by little all those votes were changed as people realized it was user error because it really is like getting off of a bicycle and learning to ride a motorcycle and thinking it will be the same. Now that game is almost up to 5 stars in just a couple days. Be patient and you'll be amazed.

Give yourself time to get used to the motionplus. If you are used to just having to flick your wrist and do a killer shot as you could for the first wii tennis games, you will soon realize that form does matter here. And that's a good thing. Like a real tennis game, how you hold the racket and position yourself and move makes a lot of difference and the motionplus, like magic, picks it all up.

It brings realism into the tennis game.

Give it a day and you'll realize how tremendous the motionplus is.

That said, I agree with tbe other reviewer who stated you MUST complete the training section in order to master the controls. And I also agree that it seemed like I mastered them easier playing Grand Slam tennis. It's worth it.

For the non-tennis buff vs. the expert: We have both in this household. One loved the shopping mode during tournaments because it added fun to it, the expert did not and just wanted pure tennis. You can turn that off but it's a positive if you are still learning the game or want a little more added to it.

The graphics are better in this than Grand Slam. Grand Slam's players are a bit like Speed Racer cartoons...you get who they are but they aren't as real as this. This denotes further realism.

I agree that the 1:1 reaction time of the motionplus seemed more evident on this one. We had a few issues where it didn't seem that way on the Grand Slam tennis. However, another review commenter noted that if we have an HDTV you either need special cables or to set some wii games otherwise you won't get the appropriate reaction time. We did that and it did seem to improve. Still, this one seemed better from the get go on reaction time when compared one after the other last night.

The cost of this game, as of this writing, June 13th, is the best buy for the new games that are motionplus compatible. However, this one does not come with a motionplus and it should be noted that Tiger Woods does, as does the upcoming Wii Sports Resort. If you plan on ordering any of those games and have the motionplus, you'll wind up with a spare for friends if you buy one separately with this game. If you don't have one and are thinking of getting any of those games, it makes it free with Sports Resort as of today's price. If you get it with the Tiger Woods game it is now ten bucks more because the cost of that game shot up ten bucks the day after it's release due to demand. The moionplus was originally free in that game.

This enables a new era in gaming for tennis playing and truly improving your tennis skills because you can make the ball do soooo much more with the motionplus and how you control your racket totally matters now so you are more a part of the game than before.

So which one wins? I say this one does. My honey says the Grand Slam tennis. It comes down to personal preferance I believe. Honey is the expert player and I am not if that helps your decision.

UPDATE: We just got two more votes from friends who are both tennis players. They both chose this one as the best. But also agreed it was almost too close to call. They also played with and without the wii motionplus for comparison (bear in mind, it is not included with this game) and they agreed it took a day to master but paid off in more realism in the end.

This is another great tennis game for the wii. We are actually glad we got them both as it's fun to switch them out and get some variety. Unlike the old school wii tennis games, you'll come out of this one a better player...not just better at flicking your wrist to get a shot!

5.0,False,"04 20, 2011",A3PZ4AXTY9J1DZ,B000H96C9M,Jason,"WoW is a MMO that tens of millions have tried and millions still continue to play.  When you see MMO a picture of WoW is the description pretty much.  It is the most talked about MMO in the West and the most played.  It set the standard for future MMOs pretty much.  While features in WoW have been used before its creation, WoW polished them and has created a system that is extremely user friendly and easy to pick up.  WoW brings a variety of adventure to the table and makes it so almost anyone could pick up a keyboard and mouse and crack a smile..

** GAMEPLAY **
The Core of any MMO, and an aspect WoW makes sure to fill consistently.  There is tons to do in this game, standard for almost any MMO, and it is handled very fluidly.  You pick your server, race and class.  From that point you pretty much have the MMO grind; getting quests, killing mobs, farming crafting mats etc etc. Just like any other MMO!  However, WoW has a multitude of systems setup to make life a little easier for the gamer.

Once you pick a class you will have 3 skill trees. For example, Paladin, you can go Holy, Protection or Retribution.  Mix the trees up a little bit for a balanced build or invest heavily in Retribution for DPS with perhaps a little Protection for some added Armor/Defense.  It is a fairly simple system that works effectively at showing you each trees full potential from the start.  Another aspect of the gameplay that I like.. in fact.. down right LOVE  is the dungeon finder and PvP setup(see PvP Mechanics below).  The Dungeon Finder is a must for any MMO at this point.  Pretty much rather than sitting around going LFG(looking for group) and spamming to get a party for your dungeon; all you do is open your dungeon finder... click the dungeon you want to run (if you are of proper level it will be unlocked) and queue up.  When a proper party is found you get whisked away to your dungeon.  A great alternative to the older system where you had to manually find a party; then everyone had to hoof it down to the dungeon and summon one another (pretty much it is a time saver)

There is so much to get into with WoW it is impossible to fit everything into a review. Pretty much WoW takes the time to make sure the gameplay element is solid and enjoyable.  The earlier areas have had experience boosted and quests ""simplified"" down pretty much to get you through to the end game areas faster.  In a way it makes the game ultra easy but you do get to the end game raids much faster so that is a plus.

** PvP MECHANICS **
Another aspect of WoW that has been polished to a fine shine.  With WoW you can PvP once you unlock the battlegrounds arena(level restricted).  At this point just like your dungeon finder you can queue up for PvP matches.  Quest until the queue fills and you are instantly ported to the PvP match where upon completion you get returned to where you were. PvP has many forms in WoW.  From simple CTF, capture and defend objectives to straight up conquer the other teams base.  I always enjoyed to random queue because of the variety to the objectives.  Of course there is also events that take place where participating in a certain PvP event type grants bonuses.  When PvP'ing you earn currency and can use this currency to purchase PvP based gear; the PvP version of High Tier raiding gear.

The Mechanics you find in PvP are simple, fluid and are designed to get you into matches as fast as possible while allowing you to continue questing or crafting etc.

** OVERALL **
There is not much more to say about WoW.  The game has been around for about 6 years and it shows.  There is a very high level of polish and optimization.  There is great care put into the game to make sure it stays this way also.  It is an MMO one could sit back and casually play, and with each session make big strides towards level cap.  With that said the game does have its share of problems.  It isn't so much broken mechanics or gameplay but just the overall nature of the game.

WoW is a fantastic game, don't get me wrong as I played it for over 2 years, but there are elements which I feel hurt the game in the long run at this point:
- There is just no point to the lower leveled areas at this point.  The leveling is fast and plenty of solo content to get you to cap; BUT as good as this can be it hurts the first time player. There is a lack of importance to the earlier levels.  Attempting to run early level dungeons might be difficult since you can end up out-leveling them before you even get the dungeon quests.
- Economy unbalance. The economy is just totally bonkers at times... and while add-ons have helped balance it out it still doesn't change the fact prices are going through the roof on items.  Gold seems to be the new copper at times and this only promotes gold farming / gold buying
- Gold farmers/buying is rampant.  While it won't interfere with your gameplay all that much it is a rampant problem.  While subscribed to WoW my email was just bombed nonstop with WoW phishing links, gold buying spammers, fake account links.  Unsubscribe and the amount of spam dropped 90%!  It is a major problem that Blizzard really has not addressed and in fact made it worse in some aspects.
- ADDICTIVE!!!  Beware!  The ease and fluidity of this game makes it very addictive.  The queuing systems and all... It is so easy to forget what time it is as you queue up for matches.  I know a few managers that ask new employees if they play WoW because they know how addictive the game could be.
- At level cap, PvP and Raiding is all you got.  There just was little point to actually doing PvE content since there basically was none (unlike games like Tabula Rasa, Rift, Final Fantasy 11 and Guild Wars; where there was tons of PvE variety at cap)

The problem is just the ease of execution for me. The game is fantastic but there is little emphasis on the earlier levels so you just blow through them to get to level cap and PvP / Raid over and over again.  There isn't much to do besides that on a PvE level so at level cap if you do not have the time to RAID and dislike PvP you will be pretty bored at level cap; unless you want to run standard dungeons all day.  But, with all that said, WoW is a must play game though even with its problems(5 stars).  Even if you hit Cap and find nothing to do.. the trip is worth the price of admission; and who knows... the structure of the game might just turn you into a PvP/Raid junkie after all.  It did for me as WoW was the first game where I actually enjoyed doing Raids and PvP content.

I don't have Wii Fit, but this is the first game I've tried for the Wii that really gives DDR a run for its money.

At the beginning, go to Free Play mode first as it lets you practice all the minigames on their easiest levels.  Once you get the hang of them, go to the courses on Outdoor Adventure mode that will unlock higher levels as you pass them.

The third mode, Exercise Training, has a variety of courses that range from about 5-10 minutes long.  You can't fail the games on these courses; just keep playing as well as you can for the allotted time.  One of the courses, 10 Minute Marathon, simply has you walking or running for 10 minutes.  You can use this course for interval training; for instance, run for 10 seconds and walk for 20 seconds (or the other way around!) for 20 rounds.  The Outdoor Adventure mode also allows you to design your own courses, although it seems you can only save one course at a time.

You get ""Activity Points"" for completing the exercise courses, which are put on a daily graph along with a Brain Age-like stamp.  Unfortunately there is no calorie counter in this game (unlike DDR for PS2) and it doesn't record exact dates you worked out, just ""2 days ago"", etc.  It also doesn't record your weight, but maybe that makes this more suitable for children than Wii Fit.

I'd like to add that this game is VERY beginner-friendly, especially compared to another Namco exergame for Wii, We Cheer (another excellent game, but with a huge leap in difficulty level).  Active Life can be played by anyone - young or old, from sedentary overweight folks to athletes.  On Free Play, there are scrolling instructions for each game that you can easily skip past, and Easy mode even has on-screen prompts.  Exercise mode allows you to go at your own pace, even if you have to just walk through or keep taking breaks.  On the other end of the spectrum, the most advanced courses are super-tough; I still haven't passed them!  This is one game you won't ""outgrow"".

My favorite games are the mine cart (a real core/balance challenge), mountain boarding, pipe slider, speed skating and the most DDR-like game, whack-a-mole. The mat slides around a bit (putting it on a sticky yoga mat helped) and is probably too narrow for two ""plus-sized"" adults to play at once, but it responds very well.  I would love to see future Active Life games add more enhancements to Exercise mode (like keeping track of scores, dates and calories burned) and add more types of games like perhaps a music/rhythm game and games that use lateral and forward/back jumping.

But overall, this is an awesome first entry for what I hope will be a long and successful series!",What a Workout!,1221868800,193,,

I'm only sorry they didn't get Rick Moranis to come out of retirement to add his voice to the cast.  That alone would have made it perfect, however, still pretty darn good!

""Are you crazy?!"" is what some of you must be thinking.

However, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (1995) in my opinion was more a Yoshi game that just borrowed Mario elements into its game play.

Super Mario 64 (1996) and Super Mario Sunshine (2001) offered revolutionary 3D graphics and inventive quests, but the fun factor was lacking.  Those games were more search and find games.  This game returns to its roots.  You know ... the flag pole jumping,  goomba stomping, fire ball throwing, and turtle shell kicking action we all love about this classic hero!

5.0,False,"04 17, 2012",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B0050SZ7LO,Trenton Bennett,"Regardless of whether you're familiar with Bethesda's Role-Playing Games (RPGs), Skyrim is groundbreaking.  It is a huge open world, with life breathed into it in great detail.  While it has a core storyline of epic proportions, it is also an open world you are encouraged to explore at your leisure.

The beauty of this particular game is that technology has finally reached the point where almost anything the creators of the Elder Scrolls series can imagine, can be done.  For Skyrim, this means creatures of all different shapes and sizes, including dragons:  enormous, flying dragons complete with fire-breathing & fangs.  The world feels alive because there are animals wandering through forests, fish in streams, and sunlight and seasons, but it's the dragons who really steal the show.  When you see a shadow pass over you, hear a sailcloth-like whoosh of air, then then that tremendous roar, you truly feel immersed in a fantasy world.

Your character can be any race, gender, or type.  How you play it is entirely up to you, but at the heart of Skyrim's story is that you are 'Dragonborn', a person capable of absorbing a dragon's soul and using it to unlock magical spells (called ""Shouts"") that the Dragons have used for centuries.  These spells take the form of 'Words of Power' that you can find and read from walls scribed in Dragon-speak, and the finding of these is what gives you a variety of Shouts to choose from.  The central storyline will guide you on your journey to become the hero the world needs, but in the meantime, there's no hurry:  explore, take quests, talk to people, and try things, and you will be rewarded.

Everyone familiar with Role-Playing Games has their own likes and dislikes, and Skyrim tries to cater to all of them.  If you like being able to find rare and unusual weapons or armor, go digging in Dwarven ruins, find a treasure map, or talk to an adventurer who can't quite get that artifact they've been chasing after.  If you'd rather make your own weapons and armor, you can do that, too.  Alchemy lets you collect items from within the world and use them to mix potions.  Enchantment lets you imbue magic into your equipment.  You can even mix ingredients on a stove and cook!  But none of it is necessary:  it's all just added flavor to the environment.

How you interact with others is another great feature of Skyrim:  you will meet people who ask you to do or help them with tasks, and not all of them are heroic.  In fact, the actions you take in some small village can shift the balance of power and cause things to be different the next time you return.  You can choose to be a hero or you can keep people living in fear.  If you know where to look, your character can become a werewolf or even a vampire, which opens up a whole new set of ideas.  Actions have consequences, and there may be times you made someone angry and the next thing you know, you run across soldiers or assassins with your name on their to-do list.  You can win people's respect by brawling with them, or telling them what they want to hear...or you can intimidate them into going along with your plans.

As you play Skyrim, you have the opportunity to earn helpers:  people sworn to carry your burdens, follow you anywhere, and protect you with their lives.  You can also hire mercenaries, and from time to time you'll run across people who will accompany you to a goal.  Typically it'll just be you, or you and a loyal helper.

That said, things are not perfect with Skyrim.  I've yet to encounter a serious bug, but a friend of mine has had a horrible time with multiple issues.  The UI is designed a little awkwardly:  in their efforts to let you view every object in your inventory (and even rotate it with the mouse), the developers have given you a series of scrolling, layered menus that sometimes choose the wrong option, or close when you don't click exactly on the text you want to select.  Your helpers can get weird:  my 'housecarl' Lydia has gone berserk on occasion, killing a harmless dog or rampaging up the mountainside slaughtering goats.  And then there's the fact that these characters who interact with each other sometimes don't get the idea of 'personal space':  you could be talking to someone tearfully recounting the story of how their daughter was torn apart by a werewolf when the tavern owner steps toe-to-toe with you and starts telling you they have great food here, and warm beds.  If you can live with these oddities, then Skyrim is a very playable, very enjoyable game.

I purchased the collector's edition of Skyrim.  It contains a massive and detailed statue of the dragon god Alduin, perched atop a wall scribed in dragon-speak with words of power and I love the look of it.  There is a thick, leather-bound art book, a DVD on the making of the game that fascinated me (such as how they programmed a dragon's movements, how they came up with a written and spoken language for dragons, and much more), and of course the game.  My PC has some really nice hardware, so I'm able to run at full settings, and there is also a detailed texture pack downloadable from Steam that will enhance the look even further.

That said, Skyrim for the PC requires that you use Steam to activate your game.  While the upside is that you will have updates (including a high-res texture pack) pushed to you, the downside is that once you activate the game, it is yours and cannot be resold or transferred.  There is also a content creation toolkit for you to make your own content and a rich community of people creating mods and add-ons that can be dropped into the world.  The nice part about Steam is that it will automatically keep you subscribed to any add-ons you choose:  no messing with config files or hand-loading mods and add-ons.  The Steam footprint for Skyrim can also be minimal if you want it to be.  On my desktop, I told Steam to keep the game updated, sync my screenshots with 'the Cloud', and keep me online while I play.  On my laptop, I created a different character.  I used Steam only to unlock the game, told Steam not to sync, to work offline, and I can play all I want without my Desktop save games getting overwritten.

I have to say I had really high hopes for this years Tiger Woods game because of the M+, and it honestly has surpassed all of my expectations.

This is is MUST BUY for all Wii Owners, and the version to purchase for all multi console owners.

TW10 is without a doubt the best golf game I have ever played. M+ makes it very realistic & completely immersive.

M+ perfectly reads what you are doing. Take putting for example. For the first time in a TW Wii game putting works just like real life. My first putt, I swung a bit harder than you would in ""real life"", and my ball shot across the green. It very accurately tracks whether you are taking a long or short putt. You can either look at the onscreen meter, or just swing like you would in real life. Follow through really matters too. The aiming with the M+ is perfect, the worst feature of last years Tiger is now perfectly executed. 2009 putting is still available (not like you would WANT to use it), but with motion plus, just select precision putting instead of standard and you will be amazed.

The swing mechanic? Wow. Taking a shot feels, well....natural. M+ works so much better than any of the previous versions, the accuracy is almost scary. When driving, the harder you swing, the farther the ball goes. Hit at 50% power with a slight fade, that's what you get. Power swing with a draw?  You actually having to worry about both your backswing and power/follow through in a golf video game. And if you don't know how to do those things in real life, the tutorial is concise and explains the basics of it all in few short (2 minute) lessons.

Motion+ makes the gameplay jump lightyears beyond any other golf game ever made. The gameplay certainly leaves the more visually stimulating versions(PS360PC) far behind.

The weather on the course you are playing is based on real time weather at the actual course location, which TW checks from the Wii's weather channel.

And the amount of content in this game boggles the mind. Most content packed Tiger Woods game ever.

Included are almost every golf related activity you could imagine, this will keep you busy for a LONG time.

Online Modes include:

*Online play: both simultaneous play & real time tournaments, daily and weekly.

Traditional Modes include:

*Quick Play
*PGA Tour
*Fed-X Cup
*Tournament Challenge (play against some of the toughest challenges in golf history)
*Stroke Play
*Match Play

Arcade Modes Include:

*Disc Golf (available for ALL 27 courses)

*One-Ball
*Team One-Ball
*Battle Golf

Mini Games
*Mini Putt (Putt Putt)
*Target
*T-I-G-E-R
*Capture the Flag
*Target2Target

I have only tried the disc golf, but it really shows off the M+. I tried throwing it traditionally, straight up, straight down, backhand and I have to say it works very well. Lots of fun. Gets me excited for Wii Sports Resort!!

2 other points of interest:

There will be downloadable content in the future.

If you are playing local multiplayer, you can play with a ""Pass the Wii remote"" mode until you get more M+ attachments.

  IGN: review on (Horizon Zero Dawn) an if you know (IGN) you know that a review like this must mean its a truly remarkable game
Theres something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered lore, terrifyingly aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory. Horizon
Zero Dawn is one of those games, and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying genre. Coupled with wonderfully flexible combat and a story that touches on unexpectedly profound themes, I found it hard to tear myself away from Horizon even after Id finished its main campaign some 40 odd hours later.

What's the deal about this game? well, gameplay and gamecontrol absolutely perfect, at first you think: ""why do i have to jump using the triangle?"", well, after a while you see that the controls are perfectly adjusted to the game.

One of the biggest draws to this game is the huge world, yes it's not technically all open world you'll encounter invisible walls/boundaries. Yet their done in a way that each large section feels like a bigger open area, secludes off areas by difficulty in this way instead of just running around aimlessly. The world is overall much bigger than anything that's come before it and has tons of things hidden so that no areas feel sparse or overused.

 Boss fights do remind me of monster hunter on medium to harder difficultys, takes some prep before fights learning about the creature/prepping supplies. Combat is pretty tight but could use some improving, it's a tad bit too cinematic at times making my character lunge to far just to look neat doing so. So it does have a bit of a learning curve that goes with it as most enemies show no mercy and getting overwhelmed happens quite a bit. The horse could use some improving as well, it can be stubborn trying to control at times. I think it's mainly do to the auto road follow that it uses as it will follow roads on it's own but I would like to have the option to disable it in the future.

Graphics look very good on my pc running on a watercooled i7 4790 cpu,msi gtx 970 gpu and 16gigs of ram. My biggest gripe though is the plant/foilage textures.. everything else looks excellent but whoever did those textures failed hard at making something realistic looking. I figure they did it to improve fps but I think they went far too low res as it's an eyesore compared to the rest of the environment.  Nvidia has some more work to do though with hairworks which is an optional graphics option that makes hair look realistic. I understand it's calculating many things to show the hair strands but needs more options to gain fps as theirs some configs available by editing the ini file to improve performance.

Overall it's the game everyone hoped it would be really, touted as a 200hr adventure which I could agree too considering i've put in 20+ hrs and am only lvl 8 so far feel like I've just barely scratched the content which makes it money well spent knowing that it'll keep me occupied for some time.

Alien: Isolation is an interactive love letter to O'Bannon, Giger and Scott. And every good thing you may read about this game is true. The atmosphere, Alien A.I. and production quality is all top-notch and AAA grade. If you've ever wondered how you would fare in Ripley's stead now is your chance to face the titular Alien head-to-head.

I pre-ordered this and just now I have finally beaten the campaign on hard. (No brag, just fact.) When I got the ""Survivor"" trophy the system told me that only 2.7% of the people who have played the game had actually accomplished this digital facsimile of crossing the Rhine and I'm not confused as to why. This game is brutal...

At least until you learn how you're supposed to play it. Which is to say, your strategy may or may not fit. As an example I spent what probably amounted to five hours trying to deal with the first significant appearance of the Alien and was being way too cautious. Once I learned that I could not actually hide from the Alien but was being forced to do brazen things I would never actually do in that situation I was never stuck like that again. And I must say this forcing confrontations and the inability to let me handle the encounter the way I wanted was a big disappointment. This to me turned the game from 'Alien Encounter Simulator' to 'I dare you to X' and I didn't like that part of it.

After a while the Alien just becomes a nuisance and can be overcome by the resourceful or prudent and eventually dealing with the other hostiles becomes more of a second nature thing. But even at the end I still found myself sweating with an elevated heart rate more than once. It was real and it was fun but it wasn't real fun. If you know what I mean, Vern? James Cameron likened making Aliens to 40 miles of bad road. That's what I just went through with this game. But at least now my Xenophobia is cured.

One last thing to consider is that, after playing this and watching Alien and Aliens, this game has ruined the films for me. I no longer feel any tension when watching them and if anything, I'm sitting there mentally figuring out where I would hide, chastising the characters for not properly using equipment and generally thinking I did a much better job than they did.

Here's hoping we can play as Newt of LV-426 sometime. (^.0)

The game has some major bugs:
* Stuttering framerates in cinematics.
* I encountered a crash 10 minutes from the end and had to replay a certain key portion before I could beat the game.
* The last 1/3 of the last mission I had to walk around with Amanda's head tilted to the side so that was disorientating to say the least.
* And there were plenty of minor hiccups not worth mentioning.
* A not insignificant portion of players can't even finish the game due to a bug during mission 15, so player beware.",The best game that you won't want to play.,1415145600,12,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The track designs are upgraded, with more of a 3D feel to them. The Bowser's Castle areas look more like those out of Mario 64 than Mario Kart. The rich texturing and colorful animation take full advantage of the GBA's capacity (which is more powerful than the SNES, believe it or not). Too prevent the total deja-vu for older games, the track layouts are different, with more tracks, different objects to use both offensively and defensively, and a host of new challenges. This is a major plus because I beat the old Mario Kart in evey way possible. It is nice to have some new fun with an old concept.
The music is superb, and the sound effects are classic Mario. As usual, you have a bunch of characters to choose from, including Mario, Luigi, Princess, Bowser, DK, Toad and others. A nice addition is that each character is rated according to speed and weight, so you can be more informed about which racer to choose. The controls are easy to master, and allow for fluid control while driving on the circuit. For gamers on the go, I cannot think of a more fun game.
Overall, this is one of the benchmark games for the GBA, and one that ensures many hours of fun and quality game time.

Considering I have no intention of touching the multiplayer, I find this to be a fair price for the title.  A full 50 bucks would be too steep if you are a person such as myself who doesn't play the multiplayer in these sorts of games.

Overall: This is an excellent third person shooter.  While it's not as smooth as some others in the genre, it's damn close.  It also lacks the frustrating silly parts of other games, such as annoying ""shine lights at evil bats"" sections that a game like Gears of War might have.  The storyline is very very good for an action game, and still very solid even when compared to games that are not in the action genre.

I highly recommend this game, so long as you go into it knowing that it's short and you will probably need to not pay full price if you intend to only experience the single player portion.  As long as you recognize that, you'll be in for a good time.

Pros:
- Solid shooting mechanics with great feeling and sounding weapons.
- Excellent story that will make you regret mowing down the countless enemies that you face.
- Multiple endings, though your decisions during the campaign don't affect it very much.
- Very solid voice work, especially in how your characters act and react to the environment.  You'll notice your character actually changes what he says throughout the campaign when you do things like melee kills.

Cons:
- Controls can be a bit wonky and unintuitive.  Expect to to hug walls when you intend to vault over them a few times.
- A few moments feel very much like they are ripped from Nolan North's other big game, Uncharted.  It can result in a situation where you feel a bit disconnected from the game.

However, compared to Daggerfall, Morrowind is a masterpiece.  Anyone who complains about linear gameplay needs to try this one out.  If your not careful, you will never, I repeat NEVER, finish the main story.  Kill the wrong person, and your quest fails.  But you are always free to continue exploring, even if you have doomed the world to total destruction.
As far as gameplay, Morrowind makes great use of the button layout, and never seems too cluttered.  I was amazed to see how well this game was brought from the PC to the Xbox.  Beyond the controls is the depth of character personalization.  Everything from clothes to armor and weapons are equippable, and computer characters will not hesitate to criticize or applaud your coordination.
Your character progresses through the training of skills.  This can be done by seeking out a qualified teacher, or through continued use of the skill.  The more you use a certain weapon, the better you get.  Wanna be a master thief?  All you have to do is keep practicing your lockpicking and stealth.  This goes the same for weapons, magic and athletic abilities like swimming and jumping.
This freedom to explore character skills also translates into a near infinite number of ways to finish the game.  Be a lone warrior out to avenge wrongs, or a ruthless assassin killing all in your path.  Your character is truly an extension of your own personality, but don't be surprised if your reputation precedes you.  Word travels fast in this game, despite the fantasy setting.  So if you find women fleeing at your approach, and you keep getting attacked by traveling adventurers and guards, maybe you should think a little longer the next time you get the bright idea to slaughter an entire village.",One of the Best RPGs Ever Made,1062892800,2,,

While there have been some decent to good Spider-Man games in the past, many have been average to poor.. Super-hero games often fell flat throughout gaming history, as it didn't live up to the overall feel of the comics. The 'Batman: Arkham' series began to change that, as that particular series was great and had the authentic feel & spirit of the comics. But Spider-Man and its success may have opened new doors for other possible comic-book games to emulate -- an open-world game with gameplay that stays true to the superhero character, along with the villains, combat, etc. Hopefully this will lead to other similar games with Punisher, Wolverine, Captain America, Iron Man, Wonder Woman, and so on.

I'll keep it brief, but the storyline and writing is superb, enhanced by many intense & gravitating cut scenes and a captivating soundtrack which makes for an ""epic"" feeling game.

The super Nintendo was what made this game famous and now Street Fighter makes its first leap onto the next generation of gaming. What made Street Fighter so famous were its easy playability and its general simplicity, but the coolness of the more memorable characters was the icing on the cake. Some of the sequels following its initial debut were disappointing to say the least as they sought to try and make the original formula better, but let's be honest; you can rarely improve upon perfection.

Street Fighter and Street Fighter II were easily the best of the series up to this point. Any in between are easily forgotten about. So it was with much trepidation that Street Fighter IV was heard by the ears of many old school fans asking ""please not another torturous piece of garbage."" Little did they know that Capcom were planning to go back to through the traditional route and returning to the idea of simplicity and fun, but adding to the awesome imagery of the past. It also planned to bring back a lot of the characters who were discarded by Street Fighter 3 and told the makers of that ""you can't get rid of the coolness.

The game itself tries very hard to return to the traditional feel of the past games, but also to bring it up to date so it would look fitting for the PS3 generation. The 6 button fight system and the 2D platform fighting format make a very welcome return, and thankfully they don't try and take it to the 3D fighting experience and just have it be annoying. The fighters are designed with an anime style cell shading which gives them both the cartoonish image, whilst maintaining a 3D next Generation appearance. The fighting backgrounds are entirely 3D and are immensely detailed and add a lot to the whole experience.

The fighting is something very enjoyable indeed as the game is very responsive to a persons' button mashing ways and I certainly found myself hitting any and every button and pulling off an amazing ""ultimate combo."" There are of course the combinations that you can master in order to pull off these moves once you've filled your ""Super"" bar to an acceptable level, but if you're like me, you'll just hit any and every button until something really cool happens and it will eventually, I promise. The main roster of characters is drawn straight from Street Fighter II and has a few wonderful additions to its roster. Abel, the French amnesiac. Rufus, the fat American and Seth, Dr. Manhattan on LSD. In addition to a few others of course.

The collector's edition to this game, contains a 65 minute anime film called ""The Ties That Bind"" which could possibly explain the beginning and end anime scenes from the arcade mode for each character. The arcade mode is simply a way of fighting through a number of wonderful foes to reach the dreaded Seth. He's a really tough one to beat I must say. The game also contains a challenge mode which consists of Time Trial and Survival for both Normal and Hard difficulty. They can be a chore, but are certainly a good way of helping you become familiar with the game so you can become ready to take on the legendary Gouken who can only be unlocked through a certainly difficult and complicated manner.

The online mode is pretty simple but offers certain awards that will certainly convince you to give it a darn good go. You can unlock a number of badges and other particular awards, and also accrue a number of points for every impressive win you pull off, meaning you can progress through the ranks and become the best of the best. There is absolutely no lag in the gameplay from what I noticed and even if it recommends you only connect to those with a superb online connection, I had no problem connecting to and playing those who had a terribly low connection. I've only managed to win one online match so far.

This is a highly enjoyable game with lots of replay value and a high addiction capability which I'm sure will have many complaining relationships have broken up because of it. I would highly recommend it to those loyal fans of the series and it's certainly hard to imagine that it almost didn't get made.",The Definitive Button Masher.,1240272000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Names that just about everyone outside of the genre has heard of; Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Lex Luthor, The Joker.  A few are a bit more random, like Deathstroke the Terminator.  But, you'll have that in a game with lots of characters.  Over on the Mortal Kombat side, they also went with the safe bet and gave us most of the fan favorites.

I have been underwhelmed with most of the Mortal Kombat stuff that has been thrown out there in the last seven or eight years, but I found this game to be a delight.  It's easy to learn, it has a bunch of characters, but not enough to make it impossible to get good at a majority of them, and, if you waited till now to pick it up, it's pretty darn cheap.  If you're reading reviews, that means you're at least thinking about buying this game.  Stop now, and buy it.  It's worth your money, if only for the lovely chaos that is The Joker.  Seriously, just say ""Boxing Glove Gun"" out loud, and you know you'll want this.

Gameplay is good, graphics are good, sound's alright, characters are well-chosen and diverse enough to please even the more picky of fighting game enthusiasts.  There's no bonus content, though.

And it was amazing. Take control of a civilization and guide from the dark ages all the way to the launch of a space ship to an alien world. The only way you can possibly describe a game that attempts to simulate all of history is EPIC. Civilization II was greatly loved, and with good reason. It was quite possibly the most addictive strategy game ever when it was released. So when people heard about a sequel to what many considered the greatest game of all time...
Alpha Centauri. In my opinion, this IS the greatest computer strategy game ever, to say nothing of the greatest turn-based computer strategy game ever. There is just so much to love.
First, this game is amazingly engineered. It had VERY low system requirements when it came out, and runs fantastically on a modern machine. The interface is brilliant. The graphics are clean and detailed. The background sounds are perfect. When a technology comes up, you get a voice reading about it, when you build a wonder, you get a cool movie to watch.
And there are so many ways to play within each game. You can micro-manage everything, telling your formers exactly what to do, telling every city exactly what to build, designing your own unit types. Or you can set formers, cities, and units to be completely automatic.
And of course each leader you can choose has distinct advantages and disadvantages, lending themselves to different playstyles. It would take quite a while to master every faction and playstyle in this game.
And I haven't even gone into the multi-player, the senarios, and the fact that almost EVERYTHING in the rules of the game is customizable. I believe there are about seven or eight ways to win! But of course the the harder ways take longer and give a higher score...
In conclusion I will say this. This would be a great game if it were merely civilization in space. But what makes it the best of all time for me is the story. There is a sci-fi storyline to this game, and when interacting with other faction leaders you almost feel like you're watching a historical epic with you as one of the main characters (at least that's how I felt the first time I played). I once even found myself daydreaming about conversations I was having with different faction leaders. Maybe I had just gone a little too long without sleep, maybe I was just playing a little too much, or maybe...this is the greatest strategy game ever made.

Instead of trying to round up the Ham-Ham's this time, your goal in this game is still very simple. A devil-ham (get it?) named Spat decides to destroy love and harmony around him with his mischievous nature. Hamtaro is chosen by the angel-ham Harmony to team up with Bijou (who he has to save first) in order to counter Spat's evil ways.

Now the concept is very cute but in retrospect, it's kind of horrifying that the devil is trying to destroy love and friendship (sounds like My Little Pony Friendship is Magic season 2 episode 1 and 2.)

Like Ham-Hams Unite, this game is challenging, even more so, but as a result, there are more things to do. The graphics in this game are way better than the GBC (and that was VERY good for its time). Fun Land has all the mini-gams and getting the highest score is always a plus. Rocks are used to make gemstones now (and that's how I learned about some gem stones in real life through this gem...I had no idea I was a turquoise).

But in this game, you go from location to location to mend the broken bonds between characters...and again the game expects you to know who these characters are. Seriously, I had no idea who Pepper was when introduced in this game and years later, I'm still stumped when she shows up in the anime.

But everyone knows the hardest stage in this game was Boo Manor. Unlike some people, I didn't get stuck here (but the Beethoven section in the game was what got me though because you had to know CLASSICAL music and the game was generous to throw hints around the area but if you weren't the type to look everywhere (and who would in the mansion full of creepiness as a kid?) you were screwed.

Back to the characters though, this game does better with expanding on them and redeemed Stan to me given how instead of hitting on the chicks, he hangs out with his sister until Sandy and Maxwell hook up and then he goes. A caring brother here then in the last game. Some characters have been demoted from the original game like Panda and Jingle (does he even show up at all).

Spat is the best villain ever. He's got a cool, catchy theme, he is pretty threatening (the thing he does at Sandy Beach is messed up. I mean, he pushed Barrette into the ocean and left her to DROWN and it's only a miracle that Seamore knew how to swim) and he BREAKS THE 4TH WALL. Plus, a lot of entertaining things end up happening to him in the game and it's hilarious. It's like Laharl from Disgaea going into another game and then you got Harmony who is Flonne trying to force the power of love on him with hilarious results.

This game is way cheaper than the prequel so if you like cuteness and a challenge, get it (and that's if you're a Hamtaro fan).",The Power of Love = Absolute Cuteness,1363132800,,,

5.0,False,"10 7, 2007",A1TPXS3X3QJIEO,B00006LEM1,Arthur Gardner,"This is probably the best example of Capcom's peak of pinnacle potential as far as fighting games goes, not that that's a bad thing but you'd hope more of games like this from Capcom but then you'd have to remember how hard Capcom is for change and that anything 'new' they come out with is going to be a very minimal push in that direction in hopes it'll bring something amazing in the process-- small bites, huge flavor take note.

Marvel VS Capcom 2? Your expectations will be heavily exceeded if you manage a copy of this game to be had in your hands. I'd actually never knew there were a limited amount of copies of this game so when I checked out EBay and Amazon prices of this game, they range from 90 to sometimes, (in the most heart sinking experience) up nearly to the thousands of dollars... it's amazing just how priceless this game may seem but it holds true considering just how GOOD this game really is with a huge unprecedented scene of over 50 characters... you can admit some of the characters are worthless, but I see them more as handicaps you can pit yourself with while fighting other people; gag characters; jester anomalies; the ""IN YO FACE"" factor... seriously, if you can manage a team of just Roll, Servbot and say... Hayato, or Captain Commando, but do most of your damage with Servbot and perhaps defeat two of your enemy's characters with just him... that's really telling you something.

I do have two complaints about this game but they can be easily remedied, well one of them at least... the first complaint is the soundtrack to the game... playing it through, you kinda feel like you're in some jazz club that went horribly wrong-- how? Well first think of playing something like The Rippingtons or something as some crazy anime battle is going on... it's just like that in a sort. The music is HORRIBLE! After almost losing my mind for allowing myself to let it play through once as I finished a game, I couldn't stand it anymore and just went to Options and muted the music all together, do yourself a favor, hit up your stereo/boombox and play your own tunes compatible to your tastes while you play this and you'll be fine. My second concern is of ONE character in the game... and it's something Capcom has seemingly refused to do since the birth of Darkstalkers, yes, I mean the animation for Morrigan... ... I swear, it's been YEARS since they've created her, and it's about time they reconstructed how she feels because she is the ONLY character in that game that feels out of place as far as actually playing the game goes. I mean it, play another game that has her in it, like Capcom VS SNK 2 and then play this game... she plays exactly the same way, and that's a damn shame.

===

In all, this game is like a relic, should be owned, cared for and honored as one of the greatest achievements of fighting game innovation. Is it the best? Well my preference still says Guilty Gear was (Not the X Series... I'm talking about the ORIGINAL Guilty Gear game from 1998) but that's just me... if I don't want my fix of Sol Badguy or Chipp Zanuff destroying the opposition, I pop this game in and use my most favorite team of all time: Hayato, Captain Commando and Megaman and go to town for a few hours.

It's a shame this game is discontinued as a title to be purchased and subject to EBAY and Amazon high price enthusiasts but that leaves this game much to be reveled in as an authentic classic among the few that exist today.",32-Bit Hall of Heroes!,1191715200,,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},

DW7 was my first game in the series. i really really liked it. its story mode was long but entertaining. there was alot of content including 60+ unlockable characters to use in conquest mode.i know most games in the series aren't very different and don't change much and while thats true for some aspects everything else has been revamped.first up is story. once again its the ROT3K story. HOWEVER not only has DW7's superb storytelling returned but the story has been expanded! how can things be expanded on a story told so many times? its rather simple. the new characters! things that happened in DW7 became even more interesting. for example in DW7 liu bei simply requests the help of zhuge liang. but in DW8 liu bei meets Xu Shu who's a friend of Zhuge Liang. Xu Shu helps liu bei break through the enemies formation and leads him to Zhuge Liang. An improvement right?Theres also alternate paths you can take and ""what if"" endings! Onto gameplay! Now i kind of had doubts that i would enjoy this game and thought it would be DW7 with new characters. But im having much more fun playing DW8! its of course a hack n slash game.new mechanics have been added to DW8 that weren't in DW7. first off rage mode is here. rage mode can be entered by filling up a bar while K.O.ing the enemies. it allows you to do a very very long musou-like attack! This entry also features a Leveling system so you can grind away! also facing officers is pretty different now.each character has a type. these types are used in a X beats Y,Y beats Z, and Z beats X style. it makes some officer fights alot harder. BUT there are other mechanics that balance that out and give an underdog special advantages to even the odds. every character new and old each have 3 musou attacks! but the best change is the fact that no 2 characters use the same weapon! on top of different weapons and movesets the weapon switching system is back so if for some reason you find a character bad you can always switch to something you like using. Horse riding is revamped and is perfect. before getting on a horse could be frustrating but now you hold down the button that calls the horse to come and you automatically get on. UNFORTUNATLEY this time around the map is terrible. yes you can see your objectives but its crowded and its hard to see your icon. theres also Frame rate drops(slow down) but it only happens a few times. But since everything else is as good as it could possibly be these flaws can be easily overlooked. and of course sound. the voice acting is fine and a good bit of DW7s voice cast returns. the music is absolutely spectacular! its better than DW7! don't believe me? watch this games opening and listen to the track! the only issue with sound is the fact that the story isn't narrarated.now for graphics. the graphics are dated. yes theres a huge difference from DW7 but they still could be better. HOWEVER the fact that the engine runs pretty good with these graphics is great. but it shows koei needs to go next gen to look any better or decrease the amount of enemies and look as good as other games.so everything sounds good but is there any replay value or enough new content to warrant the purchase? heck yes! this is one of the few games i bought for $60 that was worth $60! new content includes a revamped story mode,free mode(BOTH have ONLINE AND OFFLINE CO-OP!) which returns from previous DW games before DW7, brand new ambition mode where you build a town or something by doing battle, and quite a few brand new characters! New characters of shu include the wise Xu Shu(from DW7E),guan yu's third son guan xing,guan xing's sister guan yinping, and son of zhang fei the outgoing zhang bao. all use new weapons and my favorite is a tie between Shu and Xing.new to Wu is the wise Lu Su and the humble Han Dang. Lu Su is my favorite out of the 2 as his rake is pretty cool and it makes him fun to use! Wei just got awesomer with 2 brand faces and 2 from DW7XE!There's the quick Yue jin,the strong but modest Li Dian, the scary wang yi(DW7XE), and the orb using guo jia(DW7XE)!Yue jin is easily my favorite and he has 3 spectacular musou attacks! Overall if you are new to the series buy this one. if DW7 was your first game you will love this game. if your a veteran fan of the series the gameplay changes alone are worth checking out! also look out for the colorful hack n slash game one piece pirate warriors 2 hitting psn around the end of august! now go rack up some K.O.'s!",truely a different game,1374624000,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

The Kirbies are ULTRA CUTE. There is no way you can hate them.
There are three modes: Air Ride, Top Ride and City Trial. Air Ride is a simple race. Top Ride is a mini race that you view from the top. City Trial(my favorite)is where you power up in a city by getting new air ride machines, power-ups for the machine and getting advatage of all the events that happen in the city(falling meteors, Dyna Blade the giant bird, bouncy power-ups, ect.). Then when time runs out in the city, you play a mini game(drag race, target flight, air glider, destruction derby, ect.). If you got enough of the right power ups in the city, you win! So, for example, if you get lots of the Top Speed power-ups in the city, have a fast air ride machine, and the mini game is drag race, you win! Also, Kirby is multiplayer: even more fun!!! It only takes up a few memory blocks, too.
AND, you have all these records to break on all the modes. Like, ""Get 10 Turn Power-Ups in the city"", ""Fly for 15 seconds in Target Flight"" or ""On Air Ride, come in 1st place without hitting the walls."" There are more than 100 of them.
AND...there are two Legendary Machines called Hydra and Dragoon. You have to collect their pieces in City Trial to get them. Hydra is the king at speed and strength, and Dragoon is the master at flying.

I hadn't even realized that there had been a sequel, if you could call it that. Anyone who has ever played Wolfenstein 3D will remember the very low-quality graphics and sound (and for anyone who has forgotten, or who hasn't played it, the original is included with this game), the very few weapons, and all of the evil characters that looked the same. At the time, it was a fun game. But now? Wolfenstein has received a makeover, and it has never looked better. Or sounded better. The graphics are so great, it's almost like you're actually there. Sneaking around outside the castle, you can hear Nazis talking as they listen to classical music. You can find one getting drunk in an alley. And the Uber Soldats? They are big and mean, and ready to pump you full of electricity and missiles.
With that said, I would like to tell you how many times this game has literally made me jump. Quite a few times, actually, whether the floor unexpectedly gave out from beneath me, or a zombie just appeared out of nowhere. These little surprises were unexpected, and unpredictable. That is how you know when a game like this is good. I like being surprised by a game. Predictable games are too easy and pointless. However, Wolfenstein does have some incredibly hard levels. The one I was stuck on for a month was my first visit with an Uber Soldat, and I just kept on dying. But, every level in every game is eventually beatable, as long as you just take a deep breath and keep trying (and even though you may be tempted to use cheat codes during this particular level, I didn't, and I must say I felt very proud of myself when I finally did beat it).
I have not actually finished the game yet. I have so many games to play that I end up taking long breaks from each one from time to time. But come to think of it, this one hasn't been played for a couple of months. I think I'll go play it now.

Not only do you get the new sleek Wii Remote Plus (with Motion Plus built-in, thus eliminating the need for costly and bulky Motion Plus attachments), but you also get a fun little game.  FlingSmash isn't going to be an earth shattering gaming experience for anyone, but it's a fun little game with a simple but effective control scheme that utilizes the precision of motion plus controls in some interesting ways.  If you like games that put a fresh spin on classic breakout-style gameplay, this should be right up your alley, and the kids like it too.

Prices fluctuate, of course, but right now, this bundle is actually cheaper than just buying a Wii remote by itself. Not only do you get the Wii Remote Plus, but you also get a very nice little game with it, all for less than a new Wii remote (it's cheaper than a stand-alone Wii Remote Plus and also cheaper than a stand-alone standard Wii Remote without motion plus built in). In short, this is a great deal.  If you don't like the game or purchase multiple copies for multiple remotes, you can just trade the game(s) in and get some money back to use toward buying yourself some other games or you can give the game(s) to friends or family members who also own Wiis.

All that said, I pre-ordered my bundle at the original full price, and I still feel as though I got my money's worth.  :)","Nice package, great deal",1290988800,4,,

5.0,False,"08 31, 2005",A21P8800ZGRGIP,B00006C28W,Miketheratguy,"THE SHORT: A pretty good story mode, and tons of things to unlock in the addictive challenges and combat modes- all of which can be played alone or with multiple players. Decent but limited mapmaker.

THE LONG: I flat out didn't like TS1. The single player or ""story"" mode consisted of running back and forth for fetch quests, and the mapmaker let me set up corridors but gave me just a tiny handful of patterns to design it with. It was fast and it was pretty (minus the overly stylized goofy characters) but I didn't think it was much of a game.

This first sequel improves on almost all of what I had issue with. For starters, the game's just as pretty and runs very smooth and very fast (keeping fairly consistent in multiplayer as well). The storyline is better too- it's like Goldeneye with actual mission goals that change or grow as the level progresses. But I personally had the most fun with ""arcade mode"", which is multiplayer combat. I want to specify here that this is where the game excels over such titles as even the much hyped Halo (and even more recent games): like Perfect Dark, this is one of the very few games where I can play multiplayer matches against computer opponents. If you're like me you don't always have enough people around for 16-player, 4 system links and whatnot. Frankly I usually prefer to play alone anyway. And in this way, Timesplitters 2 accommodated me.

For example, like Perfect Dark, this game features some levels that I liked more than others and so, not wanting to play the story mode, I wanted to just jump into that cool level and fight some opponents. This game allowed me to do so, picking not only what opponents I fought but also how tough they were and what weapons were used. In addition, I could set parameters such as time/kill limits, and by the time I unlocked them, could choose among more than a dozen different combat variations such as ""Flame Tag"". In other words, this game lets you play multiplayer, storyline stuff, or plain old combat- with or against other humans in each case.

There are loads of unlockables, as well. There are more than 100 different characters in the game, with at least half of that number representing legitimately unique and interesting choices. Each has their own stat rating such as speed and accuracy, and some characters such as robots have extra advantages like immunity to fire. This adds even more strategy to deathmatches but can be turned off as well.

In addition to unlocking the characters, you'll be unlocking goofy cheats such as pirate hats or practical things such as new levels and combat modes. This is one of those games where every level, challenge, or combat scenario rewards you with new stuff once completed, so there's a very satisfying feeling of constant progress and perpetual motivation to try to meet each goal. Some of it is tough- sometimes tuned to be just barely within your grasp, but there seems to always be other stuff to accomplish if you get stuck. For each of three nights, I went to bed satisfied that I unlocked some of the cool stuff I'd wanted, then played the next day and opened up even more. It was addicting.

Thankfully, this was all set up within a very pretty package. The stylized, exaggerated look from the first game is still here for those that liked it, but for people like me it's nice that characters are a little less goofy looking. And with more than a hundred, it's easy to develop favorites. The graphics during gameplay itself are solid and the game moves quite fast for being several years old, even during multiplayer combat with a

handful of AI opponents thrown in.

And again, that's where the game gets its highest marks from me. While the storyline is interesting enough and fairly engaging in its disparate levels, it was that combat that made me keep playing this game. By the time I played through most of the basic and ""arcade league"" challenges, I'd unlocked around 15 different deathmatch types- modes such as capture the flag, king of the hill, last man standing, and more bizarre stuff such as monkey helpers- in which the person in last place gets monkeys with heavy weaponry. When you figure that you can pick from a dozen or so stages, add up to 10 AI opponents whose difficulty you set, throw in weapons of your choice, and then pick the score type and combat parameters, that's a huge amount of customization. As I said, it's a level of single-player control and immersion the likes of which I haven't seen since Perfect Dark.

Controls feel natural and very intuitive, the graphics and sound are appropriate (and downright amusing) and the options are very thorough. The pace of unlocking stuff is great, with a couple dozen hours of perpetual new stuff. Altogether this is a fine game, which at this point you can grab for just $10-15 bucks.

While we all know we get to play as Sonic, there's a new kid in town, and he helps Sonic in his second outing. Tails is supposed to be Sonic's sidekick. Characters aside, let's talk about the gameplay. The gameplay is identical to Sonic 1's, but with several differences going on in-game.
1. The spin dash move is introduced
2. 7 full zones with 3 1-act ones.
3. Tails
4. Different Special Stages

The special stages are entirely different from the first game. Now you must run through a halfpipe, collecting rings to get Chaos Emeralds. However, this is easier said than done. The sound and music are, once again, excellent. The graphics are also great, as they are an improvement of Sonic 1's.

What's really great about this game is the multiplayer mode. While you do have to compete against the other player in finishing the levels first (or getting higher scores), you guys also have to beat those 4 multiplayer zones altogether!

Overall, the game is awesome and challenging. This is the Sonic game all fans should get.

UPDATE: I found out a really cool Easter egg. In 1-Player mode, someone can actually control Tails as the second player! This is pretty much the closest thing to a 2-Player co-op mode. Although Sonic still hogs the camera, your friend can help collect rings, defeat the bosses, get rings in special stages, and he/she can just plain goof off.

It's well known that the lines have always been divided between those who view wrestling as a modern day performance art, and those who view it as grown men in tights performing homoerotica feats of fury.  Likewise, the lines have been clearly been drawn between which ""style"" of gameplay the gamer likes in his/her grappling.  While the Aki WWF titles of old, as well as the Fire Pro series cater to the sim minded, with thousands of move possibilities at any given time, the Smackdown series instead opts to portray the ""sport"" as it truly is: a fast paced, rhythmic spectacle. This translates smoothly into gameplay terms, thanks to the streamlined control set.  It hasn't changed a great deal since the series' inception, but Shut Your Mouth has more moves than any other installment, while remaining just as easy to control. Though the controls remain largely unchanged, the graphics have received the shot in the arm they so desperately needed. While hair textures still look plastered on, everything else looks absolutely fabulous. Stages, character models, arenas, lighting; these all look so realistic that you'd think you're watching the show on TV! Well, not really, but it is the prettiest wrestling game on the market. Likewise, the painstaking attention to detail in each wrestler's mannerisms that can break or make a game like this was not skimped on: every ring entrance is 100% authentic, down to the boas on Hulk Hogan's neck. Many other fixes that the series so desperately needed were applied in Shut Your Mouth: The horrid commentary is kept to a minimum, and what's there doesn't sound like a robot clone piecing words together.  Season mode actually feels like an honest-to-goodness season for the first time since the idea was proposed.  The game no longer takes half your memory card, nor loads after every screen.  And while you can't sanction title matches, you can play the role of booker in a limited role by deciding who goes to what show in the pre-season draft. It's in no way perfect, and the gameplay still needs to be slowed down a little, rather than sped up, as it seems to have been in version 4.0.

I haven't experienced any bugs, and the game has never frozen. (well, I've only played GTA3 so far, not Vice City yet)
The graphics are amazing. They are more detailed than PS2 and feature more reflective surfaces.
I never played GTA before very much because my Xbox is my first console in like 8 years and I just got it a month ago. GTA is already my favorite game for the console, and for just $50 (i actually got mine on sale for $42, but i don't think i can say where i found it, since i'm writing this on amazon.com) its a unbelievable deal. For people who never played it before, *definitely* get this double pack. The games are ridiculous loads of fun.
Oh yeah, it is kind of violent, but the real reason a lot of people are upset about the game is because you are free, as the player, to do anything you want. So you can do the missions and kill a few bad guys and win the game, or you can just roam around the city, chasing down pedestrians and mowing down old grannies with your shotgun. The point of the game is really about driving and coming up with strategies real fast.
And one more thing...the driving in this game is fun! The first time I hopped into a ""Cheetah"" (looks just like a corvette, but i guess rockstar couldn't license the names of real cars) my heart skipped a beat. When you floor it, this car flies down the street past all the other cars and the controller rumbles slightly as the engine revs. it's pretty incredible.
So buy the game already!",All around great package,1072915200,,,

Here's the highlights of my total biased review:

1. GRAPHICS- The BEST of this type of game, the make good use of the HD television, you won't be dissapointed.
2. SOUND- You can hear every scream in Hades Realm, every foot step Kratos takes, every gory blood sputtering kill
3. Storyline- It connects to the previous GOW games, pretty solid and a different take on Greek Mithology!
4. OVERALL- What did you expected from my biased review? I love this franchise one of the best in Playstation history!

I can see why they took so long and why they wanted to use the PS3 for this game, they do a lot of lighting effects, close ups and new moves, may I say BATTERING RAM RULES! and new FATALITIES! making Kratos the undisputed unstopable human wrecking machine!

This is styled like it's part of Link's magical pouch. It's a brown faux-leather material. There are two elastic slots inside to hold two game cartridges. And you also get two pretty cool looking styluses: one shaped like the Master Sword, and a green one with the Hylian Shield. There is also a screen wiper that has a print of a Hyrule map; the back of it is sticky so you can stick and re-stick it to the back or your 3DS XL, or any other smooth surface. The pouch itself can fit anything up to the large 3DS XL.

The big thing about this design is it wasn't thought through. While the two styluses are cool and you have a place to put them in the front, when you close this case, the styluses stick out! It doesn't look good [see photos], so minus one star. I don't store my styluses in here, I actually put them in my other 3DS XL cases as they each had an empty space for a stylus.

This is a cute storage pouch that is well-designed to match the theme of The Legend of Zelda. Recommended.

UPDATE: I was wondering the other day if the new Switch would fit in this, and what do you know, it does! I'm so excited! All you have to do is take out the side Joy-Cons, and the Switch and Joy-Cons will just barely fit inside. You can probably stuff in a USB-C cable as well.

While the software is very slightly flaky, it works well enough and allows for per-profile tweaking of the mouse settings including the side buttons, DPI, and color. I've had no issues with it during web browsing, and even have set up dedicated side buttons for switching forward and back through tabs, closing tabs, and the browser forward/back buttons on my browser-specific mouse profile.
